At the end of the exchanges, the Prague stock exchange switched to the negative
After Tuesday morning’s fall, the Prague Stock Exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the exchanges, the Prague stock market returned to its fall the day before, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in shares on the Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the plan to stabilize the American financial sector, is thus also perceptible here.
Stock loss in Asia
The Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even if the indices managed, during the day, to erase some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s Hang Seng Index lost four percent during trading, but later it cleared some of the losses and reduced the decline to almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the movement of Chinese shares in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
Shares in the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but ultimately reduced losses to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
“Hesitation about rescue action in the US will influence financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, the head of Hong Kong’s monetary office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, that is, independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates have the same level in Hong Kong as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. lawmakers should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there would be a risk that other countries would be affected.
The bloodshed of American stocks
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the proposed support of the financial system, to which it should have spent up to 700 billion dollars (nearly 12 billions of Kč).
Lawmakers are thus denying the call for support of President George Bush's plan.
According to Bush, the project should solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday and major equity indices experienced the biggest drop in the past 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index lost nearly seven percent, having fallen on such a scale for the last time in 1987.
The clue was already losing during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress ceded: US government can inject 700 billion dollars into banks
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the financial aid agreement to the US financial system.
It will be put to the vote early next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a turning point in talks on the adoption of a bailout in the form of 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillion crown) financial aid granted to the U.S. financial system.
Success is not safe.
Indeed, before they can publish the final version of the law and put it to the vote, the Congressmans must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Regulation Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should a priori be submitted to the Senate vote.
According to economists, the announcement that the bailout will be adopted should be a major psychological factor in reviving financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market aid can be effective, will follow a "disillusionment".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our differing views on the form that the package of measures for market stabilization should have," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could be made as early as Sunday.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of the legislators met with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson, in order to give the bottom of the government a final form.
It should buy back from financial companies the unsaleable real estate assets that drive financial firms into considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system in its entirety.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and that must be, too, effective in the market.
We still have to continue this market recovery plan, but I think we are there," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on falling equity markets.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are making Congress reach a final agreement on Sunday.
They want to calm investors before the start of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first hourly zone, where Congress’s decision could influence Monday’s trade.
However, for the moment, it is impossible to specify with certainty when the two Houses of the American Congress will proceed to the vote, nor if the negotiations are not likely to remain blocked, at the last moment, by this or that problem.
Lawmakers hope it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, the law will undergo many more changes.
The total amount for the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
But, if Congress will have the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function, it has the possibility to block the granting of the remaining amount, following two steps: first 100 billion dollars more, then, finally, 350 billion dollars.
M. Bush welcomed progress in the negotiations
Although the president can veto this decision, Congress has the opportunity to put it in a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain finances for the redemption of bad real estate securities, whose value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed on Sunday to vote on the law, and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
US President George Bush is himself pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated “the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Limitation of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chair Christopher Dodd, Chief Negotiator, said lawmakers have agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, protection of contributors from losses, the relief agreement, the course of the plan on the time axis.
The new law also provides for the limitation of the said golden parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the program and establishes a committee, which will supervise the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on the issue and have made significant progress towards a deal that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also includes help for property owners, who have problems paying.
The government should negotiate new down payments in the case of mortgages it will buy back, while reducing the monthly payments of debtors and allowing debtors to keep their homes.
Marek: A psychological help
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its achievement is going to be very difficult.
"And this is because we do not know what the mechanism and the price of the buyback of problem assets will be.
This point will be decisive to decide on the division of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week at iHNed.cz.
If the plan will be adopted now, or early next week, is not that important, according to Marek.
“It is much more important that the congressmen agree this week that they will support this plan and dedicate it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, matters most at the moment," Marek said.
Three sights of right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to the preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current grand coalition, as well as a notorious strengthening of populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the governor of Carinthie Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at the national level.
According to the preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 percent of the vote, the country's first political force, however, compared with the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 percent of the vote.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent loses nearly nine percent of the vote, ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; especially for the People's Party, which called for early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Again in early July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable lead over the SPÖ.
However, the voters visibly punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculation about the possible resignation of the leader of the party and the current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer, was pronounced.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday, during the extraordinary council of the party leadership.
Such a development would a priori facilitate the path towards the outcome of the election, which remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the grand coalition SPÖ and ÖVP.
Nevertheless, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the free (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 percent and BZÖ eleven percent of the vote - the Socialists expressed at the same time the fear of a repetition of 1999, when the people's party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ parted from it) on a common government
Haider, who has previously said that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he foresees the return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently bets on this development.
The last party to have access to parliament being the Greens, but they lost slightly and fell, among the Austrian political parties, from the third in fifth place.
Obviously, no other party crosses the four percent limit and has reached parliament.
A push to the extreme: MP3 players against mobile.
We'll advise you, how to choose
While virtually all mobiles know how to play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It seems to clearly result in the better better to buy only a phone.
However, there are sufficient reasons to obtain an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a dear high-end gramophone to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl record, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason, for this to happen.
However, if there are in your shelves crammed vinyl records, with rock art, jazz or blues, you dream at least probably of such a gramophone.
The same is true of music during travel, namely compressed music, to put it in a simplified way - music in MP3.
Here too, there are categories according to price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a reader, in the same way that a Pink Floyd fan would have a hard time supporting headphones bought for twenty crowns at the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The battery life is also decisive
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are functions unknown, of course, to most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the first functions, phone calls and the sending of SMS, he is able to play music and movies, to record them, he has a camera of variable quality and can, for example, serve to be used for navigation.
And if we take into account Smartphones and communicators, you will have in your pocket a small computer.
Since no fridge can grill meat and no television will take photographs, we practically witness a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without disadvantages.
The greater the number of functions you use, the smaller the interval between two reloads.
And reading music is one of the most important energy stuff.
Mobiles are few who are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases, this figure is significantly lower.
In this respect, music players (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly more efficient.
In the case of cheap mobiles, count that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you sometimes call from time to time, get, to be on, a second reload for work - this being valid even for more expensive devices.
This is not a problem for MP3 players, who are capable, as a result of recharging, of a continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the worst performing.
Another problem arises when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, since a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
It is possible, of course, to record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to do so without reduction, being given the tiny dimensions of the memory cards used in the mobiles.
As for readers, you do not need, except for exception (iPod), no software.
Just fill, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will create a media library themselves classified according to the name of the performer, the title of the album, style, or according to the user's judgment.
Some devices display only an index with a tree structure, like the Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles have more know-how
In the choice of a concrete device, focus on the lifetime of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and the type of output of sound and, of course, the ease of control.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you will listen to it that for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you only need any mobile reading MP3.
Virtually all mobiles are capable of this today.
You don’t even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or player is able to play.
All can read the MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will have this format.
It is one of the most common formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices also manage to play WMA music.
The AAC (format used by the firm Apple and its iPods), meanwhile, is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
Simply visit, from the mobile phone, the corresponding carrier's (or other provider's) web pages and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to purchase a musical mobile.
The offer of the operators is unfortunately miserable and it is limited, in most cases, to radio tubes quickly made.
Prices are also not the lowest.
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether by GSM, internet, or even by the wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobile on themselves.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you just have to take the mobile out of your pocket, while you have forgotten your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have on your headphones or a handsfree with connection.
If not, you can use the built-in speakers, which virtually all mobiles have, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of music mobiles is their price.
The cheapest normally cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand crowns, one can have a walkman already very suitable.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of an output for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best phones and the best equipped, also equipped with an input for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy order.
Truly anyone manages to insure the order of the most rudimentary readers - who do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest (cf. our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the resemblance of the control to that of a cassette station, commonly used in the past, or of a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile internet connected by chance, followed by a huge data transmission invoice.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. The Vodafone 527) generally has a slot for exchangeable memory cards (the M2 type, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones even do with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you’re one of the most demanding listeners, choose specialized mobile-walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These apparatuses are provided with independent control keys for MP3, and this is how the ease of the command is close to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman series mobiles have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that has gone the farest in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a lifetime of the accumulator (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours) higher, is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we are still missing something - a virtual operator, which would force traditional operators to lower prices.
He may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned, many times, on Mobil.cz the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The ČTÚ (Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher with us than in the rest of the Union, confirmed this.
Thus, following the European Commission's latest steps in the field of the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper than the country's customers to select customers.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really want to get into the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, since we still have three mobile networks and penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), who has repeatedly stated that in the Czech Republic there is no more room for another operator, is making a chorus with the operators.
It is probably true that a conventional operator with its own network is apparently not much luck (by the way, now, it would only find frequencies difficult).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has led to a considerable drop in prices, to which conventional operators must subsequently also react.
Yet, even before the entry of troublemakers such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those we hear today at home were heard in Britain.
However, it appeared that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch in Poland of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator has managed to win over 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator in the country.
Add that behind the Mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, which owns among other things the U:fon in Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators being the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete target group.
In order for their operation to be efficient, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are, in fact, free from the costs of building, operating and maintaining the mobile network, which are relatively high.
This is how virtual operators in the world loom as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited service offering.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in the UK at least half the cost of its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity stunt.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
“Real men choose Mobilking – an operator they like and can trust,” said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating the virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to work at home as well.
Miroslav Čepický, the spokesman for Vodafone, doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the offer of services."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations are not very promising.
The launch of Mobilking will instead take place in other countries in our area,” said Jana Studničková, spokesman for the financial group Penta, in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible so that a potential competitor cannot appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of enterprise customers, has not hidden, for quite a long time, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
“We are very keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile.
The sooner the better.
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility several times with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have managed to move forward in the negotiations,” said Pavel Kaidl, a spokesman for the group.
Perhaps the future is promising.
According to unofficial information, it seems that we could perhaps host the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for the moment, his creation is accompanied by a total silence.
"Right now, we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with other very specific markets.
For the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us,” said Vlastimil Sršeň of the Telefonika O2 press department, in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová said in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis."
"It is virtually excluded that a virtual operator will appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited period of time, we should have a concrete agreement now."
Instead, Vodafone is directing his attention to completing requests to get his own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický said in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the field of shared costs and infrastructure.
This is what we believe means the most contributions from the customer perspective.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to set up a common network for a fast mobile internet.”
The responsible authorities: in line with the operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a fall in prices and therefore a decrease in their profit.
What is the point of facilitating the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators know how to hear themselves as the thiefs at a fair. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also testifies to this.
The greatest apparent pressure on the ČTÚ, when the U:fon was created by the company T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by the publicly available information from the ČTÚ web pages.
Today, however, the U:fon lends itself to serve as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competition in the mobile market has also been, in addition, recently amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would subject it, and especially its services, to high requirements.
But given the attitude of the mobile operators, the indifference of Czech regulatory bodies seems disconcerting.
However, this is not only the attitude of the ČTÚ, which, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power in the Czech Republic to intervene in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
However, the latter adopted, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the relevant virtual operator regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached at the moment, because the offer of potential interested parties has a priori not presented sufficient interest for conventional operators," said Kristián Chalupa of the ÚOHS Department of External Relations in response to our question.
A statement made in this way would not surprise the part of the representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an Office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, also take care, that no one benefits from its position on the market, such a declaration is more than confusing.
“Abroad, where virtual operators are normally present, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to a fall in mobile telephone prices.”
However, lobbying for the honest functioning of the market and a fall in prices is apparently not part of the interests of ÚOHS.
What is indeed shocking is the almost touching concord of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, arises quite naturally.
In the same way, a price of gasoline strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to chance and hard competition.
"The Office has not noticed any signs of anti-competitive behaviour, so it has no reason to intervene in one way or another.
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore none has an increased corresponding responsibility for its market behaviour.
The tools necessary to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably even missing from the telecommunications regulator," Chaloupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications are, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different vision of things: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, it is necessary to obtain, each time, the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
This is how it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators visibly proceed in a similar way.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including the company GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Bringing down responsibility on the ČTÚ is a fairly common turn in communications, by means of which the ÚOHS washes its hands of the case.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to pass on the novelization of the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, an expansion of the powers of the ČTÚ in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised to improve the situation.
That, the representatives of ÚOHS must know very well, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
When no one is looking, it can work
That said, the operation of a kind of pseudo-virtual operators, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies publishing their own price lists of mobile telephone services, but the latter are only public in part.
In most cases, it is about firms dealing with multi-level marketing.
Specialized mobile telephone services are offered, for example, by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually only reach elected officials.
The magic trick consists in the fact that the company is in front of the operator figure of a classic corporate customer, who orders a large quantity of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she gets special price offers (and others).
What is problematic is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If it happened what you are talking about, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would consider and that could lead to a stoppage of collaboration with the company in question," replied our question relating to this problem Martina Kemrová.
Nevertheless, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such activity has reached the heads of mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, they can be thousands of customers.
No operator, however, is against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them significant benefits, and at the same time, as opposed to true virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický indicates the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the manner of ordinary customers of mobile operators.
This is precisely what should seem strange to ČTÚ.
In addition, another question is asked at ÚOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has relatively broad powers to be able to reveal such an activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibiting it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought about a considerable decrease in the price of services.
However, in virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, conventional operators tried, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market that was too small, if not too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that regulatory bodies in developed countries have intervened, which defended not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Both by formal measures and by informal pressure, they ended up obtaining the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulatory bodies are dealing with this issue in the manner of a warm potato that is disposed of by passing it on to a nearby target.
Following the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is more than profitable to them in these cases.
But let's not throw the handle after the knock.
If the behind-the-scenes information says it is true and a virtual operator will soon appear with us, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS will only be difficult to remain impassive in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, a choir performance and an instrumental version.
The song is performed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the arrangements of the anthem.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers Czech national singing to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to the Český rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of the solo versions of the singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I had been trying to take care that the two singers, as well as the choir, had a good diction, so that we understood the lyrics well, that they sang simultaneously," he said.
Next year, the Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary.
The song Kde domov můj resounded for the first time in 1834 on the stage of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des savetiers), a Czech original play by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
It has become popular and people have spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslaovakia in 1918, the first verse naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" hymn sound
Public transport (MHD) Prague will introduce the chip into their ticketing system on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Prague Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, which, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latter is accessible to about a hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can purchase a coupon 30 days or 90 days (this one will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both register it on their smart card at the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (the Transport Agency), located in the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Rozreov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy coupons by internet on the web pages of the Dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people took advantage of the service during the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can definitively forget the ticket offices in the subway stations, where they had until now to trample impatiently in long queues in order to obtain paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon over the internet and will be registered on their Opencard in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these points of contact, there is at the disposal of passengers a ticket office with trained staff, who will help interested parties with the purchase over the internet and, in addition, will record the coupon they have purchased on their card," says project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, it will also be possible to save the electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, recall the machines to compost tickets and the passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be eighty," added Opatrný.
An automaton will control the coupon in place of the driver
The automatons that will work from tomorrow, are easy to use.
Just introduce the Opencard smart card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity of the city.
Namely in peri-urban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the municipalities of the Central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the trains integrated into Pražská integrovaná doprava (built-in transport in Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons;" explained the control of the Filip Drápal tickets of the organization Ropid, which designs the schedules of Prague public transport.
Peri-urban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver’s checkout.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but it is also necessary to place the Opencard at the place indicated on the side of the checkout.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger needs to check the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing more simple than asking the driver for this information," Drápal said.
Passengers who do not take peri-urban buses and will not remember the date on which their coupon expires, can re-enter the ATMs, which are originally used to save the coupons on the card.
This is where the information about the validity of their document will be displayed on the screen of the device.
The Sudetens were calling for a referendum in the US
The Sudeten Germans demanded in 1945 that Šumava be integrated into the United States.
This stems from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of South Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans were allegedly addressed to the President of the United States with such desire.
This stems, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
Germans from Český Krumlov ask in the letter the American president not to allow "šumavská župa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation well and want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," reads the letter, signed "Persons, to whom the fate of the Šumava is close to the heart."
Since the rallying of Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, attitude without respect, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take in his hands the protectorate of the Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign state to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and which has in no way contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants," the letter reads.
The so-called reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans of Šumava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter can, given the current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it illustrates well the expectations of the Germans of the Sudeten of the time.
While the Czech Germans had to at least foresee that the question of their expulsion from the republic arose, very few of them confessed to such a possibility.
Some were waiting for the United States and Britain to obtain some kind of autonomy for the Sudetens.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as German from České Budějovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When, at the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the capture camp of the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to teach them Czech.
“They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would be profitable for them,” Chalupa said.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, according to him, considered that, following the Beneš Decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional campaign will attack drivers
Action on the most expensive road safety in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that in order to launch, Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček believes that it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, the internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast driving and drinking.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
Above all, it wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
This is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You don't think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
Then, in a puddle of blood, there is the phrase "You'll pay."
This must symbolize that one can pay for life a moment of inattention.
The spots will "haunt" the spectators until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be commonly seen with drastic images of accident victims.
He believes that this will lead to a decrease in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The sugar and whip strategy against drivers
"What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time, when they burn a red light.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded of the drivers,” said Martin Kořán, the transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertisements, believes the psychologist.
The signs pointing out the danger to drivers are, according to him, already less efficient.
"When a static panel that warns of danger is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and drivers will no longer notice it," Kořán said.
Olmert would return in exchange for peace almost all the occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the president of the Israeli Provisional Government, spoke in favour of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made the statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
“We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all (occupied) or all territories,” Olmert said.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), since without it, peace will not be made," he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert remarked, referring to the two attacks in the city, in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people wounded.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historical places" located inside the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he said.
Retreat of the Golan Heights
Olmert also supported Israel's retreat from the Golan Heights, which he said was an indispensable condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I am not proposing to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a retreat from the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they are going to have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to give up the constant support they give to the terrorism of Hamas (Shiite movement), Al-Kaida (terrorist network), as well as that of the Jihad (holy war) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India risk cooling
If the problem concerning the Czech researchers accused in India, accused of illegal gathering of cockroaches could not be solved, he would follow, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
The minister said so today in New York, after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not solved, then yes, a certain cooling would occur," he said after the meeting, carried out following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after leaving the talks, that the executive branch could hardly intervene in court cases.
He nevertheless mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was discharged from the charge and punished with a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the case being placed under the jurisdiction of the latter.
“His problem could be solved,” the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, is to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could seek bail and wait for the trial at large, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same direction also during the talks.
"He advises appealing to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned," the Czech foreign minister said.
The only way, by which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicted "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
He also says that such help was already given to them by India.
“Above all, we want to keep with India the best relations, which have a tradition that has continued over many years.
The Indians also acknowledge it,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he pointed out to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
“We consider the incarceration and accusation of these Czech researchers to be a great mistake,” he said.
The minister dodged the issue if he got the promise from India to deal with the matter.
"I've already received quite a lot of promises," he said.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are the stewards in the bus illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance bus is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the bus of the Student Agency company near Padua, Italy, the question arises if the stewards and passengers can travel within the bus.
“If we wanted to strictly and formally abide by the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the road traffic law,” said Transportation Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess perished, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the path of the bus.
The girl was at that time unfortunately sitting next to the driver, in the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had at her disposal two other seats.
However, the bus can have an accident, or even slow down abruptly, also at the moment when the steward serves coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the coach is under its technical sheet equipped with standing or not.
If this standing equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The Student Agency long-distance coaches do not have standing seats; this has been confirmed in Aktuálně.cz by the director of the company Radim Jančura.
"This is an issue that we have dealt with with the ministry and, at the beginning, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got the passengers to go to the bathroom during the ride provided they had their own seat,” he revealed his position.
The law ignores the steward
"There is no unambiguous legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal requirement is concerned with this role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement shall prohibit the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act is only known to be the term vehicle catcher; it does not define its rights and duties," said spokesman Hanzelka.
Josef Pokorný, the director of the Department of Road Vehicle Traffic, believes, on the contrary, that the law sufficiently addresses the issue.
"It all depends on whether the bus has in its homologation permission to offer standing places.
Everything is in there,” he said.
Coaches are divided into urban, where there are standing seats and a limited maximum speed, intercity with standing seats and higher allowed speed and long-distance coaches without standing with the highest maximum permissible speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Hořín, an expert at BESIP (road traffic safety) in transport, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"During regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service on airplanes.
There either, it is not safe when turbulence will occur and the flight attendant can hit his head."
"However, in the event that the bus would have braked abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as on an urban bus or in a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of stewards with internal prescriptions," he said, and also said that from the point of view of the law, the issue is not resolved.
Jančura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only coach carrier to offer stewards services.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their profession as a risky profession.
"Nevertheless, as soon as I feel like it's a risky job, I'll remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper at boarding.
It would also reduce costs,” he said.
The concern for safety is the reason given to the absence of stewards in his vehicles the director of the Asiana Alexei Litvine, who ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have hostesses. We have been opposing it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident,” he said, a year ago, to Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy has come
A young hostess from the region of Plzeň, who had been working for the company for two years, perished during the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop strip without using a flashing and it blocked the way to the bus.
The latter's driver tried to avoid him by means of a sudden maneuver, but he brushed him by his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved for rest for the stewards have been sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these seats, they are blocked."
The company plans to file a complaint against the driver of the truck.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the judgment of the court, but with regard to financial compensation, it also relies on the culprit.
An amendment to the law?
Not in sight
A change in the law, which has been being developed for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide details on the movement of stewards on board the coach.
"It has not come to any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather on the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone at the wheel," says expert Hořín.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards to be something that would fundamentally jeopardize the safety of passengers,” said spokesman Hanzelka, adding that the control of bus safety is under the power of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
A Czech referee the fight for the seabed
It approaches a wall-mounted electronic map, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are represented.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as does the adjacent seabed.
This area is however as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of thirty members of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
Its leader, the director of the division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
Work ardour and enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a little-known world so far, rich in natural resources.
There can be oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also unknown living organisms, which may contain the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A background larger than the mainland
The coastal states have begun today to vehemently aspire to the new underwater territories.
According to a UN convention, they are indeed using their rights, over which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of what is called continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
The latter may, according to the convention, claim exclusively to all the resources of the continental shelf.
"To simplify, the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea, is considered a continental shelf.
It extends beyond the boundaries of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred marine miles that represent the said exclusive economic yone,” says Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country in question to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of continental shelf should be supported by extensive scientific-technical documentation, based on many costly prospecting and merit.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific-technical aid.
So far, the committee has dealt with five requests, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the moment, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful,” Mikulka added.
Australia's success, which is the first to have significantly expanded its underwater possessions, has recently seen a global impact.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the extent of the seabed allocated to it by the commission last week, is 1.6 million square kilometres, which represents the extent of the country multiplied by sixfold.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The benefit they will derive in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they intend, be invaluable.
Gradually, other countries will, in turn, submit their request.
They can do so within ten years after ratifying the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean floor, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no more states have an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area shall be granted by an international institution established by convention.
"Nevertheless, make no mistake, the seabed is not a Klondike," said director Mikulka, adding that "its areas are precisely clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former bloc of the countries of the East within the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This obtained in 1991, under the Convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of the so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right to extract in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and the Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The background is eventful, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract there on an area with a total area of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," enumerates Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, brings an example of such a concretion.
It recalls a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
The Düsseldorfois’ hopes are based on Frankfurt.
The words were not lacking in the letter from the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
According to a union of entities of the financial institute of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central financial markets institution of the financial group of the Sparkasse" could be constituted, according to the letter made public on Monday.
The WestLB would bring a "competence block" coupled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be the decisive kick-off to other mergers in the Länder banking sector.
This is what it looks like when a policy committee wishes to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the wounded WestLB is still under strong pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Swiss Financial Services Supervisory Authority that has, only recently, made it clear to the government of the Land of North Rhine-Westfalie that time was running out in the search for a future solution.
However, there has been talk for some time now - also on the side of Frankfurt - of a relationship of some form between Deka Bank, which knows the customers of Sparkasse through their investment funds, and the WestLB.
Certainly the head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas made it known during the presentation of the figures of the semester at the end of August that he saw no meaning in the merger of the house of the Mainzer Landstrasse with a bank of Land, whether it is the Helaba or the WestLB.
However, the board of directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported and by the banks of the Länder and by the groupings of savings banks, instructed the steering committee to conduct discussions with the WestLB for joint commercial activities.
It could then be the debit of the financial market, or parts of it.
The talks have only just begun, it is said in the financial center.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, which, with its 3000 employees, has counted for one of the largest employers in the financial centre of Frankfurt, has come into play when it comes to the consolidation of the savings bank sector.
In 2003 it was believed for a while that the Deta-Bank could merge with the bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinat and the Halbab.
Nothing came out of this ternary bouquet.
Hardly the plans had been made public as the government of the Land of Hesse pronounced against any participation of the Hellaba in them.
Afterwards, the other two houses did not meet either.
The bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinate was attached to the square at the Bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new negotiations on the grouping of the Deka-Bank with banks in Länder.
Finally, Günther Merl, chairman of the steering committee of the Hellaba, had however spoken out against any commercial strategy of merger with his bank.
Regardless of this, there seems to be a growing feeling that the consolidation of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Parliament of the Land of Bavaria has passed, a union of BayernLB with the bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg could materialize in the first.
For the Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure that forces new mergers were to increase, the potential partners gradually escape him.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it has hitherto weathered the crisis better than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart.
The grouping of savings banks and transfers of Hesse-Thuringia, which owns 85 percent of the capital of Helaba, instead fired a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with the WestLB.
The NordLB would remain to the rigor.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one facet.
Another side raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can match.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, which is the future capacity of the Länder banks should be secured, had not been resolved so far by the German grouping of savings and transfer banks.
Eventually, a westLb disappearance could take place, which here is obviously not desired.
This is also discussed in the letter of the existing Executive Committee: in any case, a `global solution' for the establishment would be addressed.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of some entities with the Deta-Bank still remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena goes with him as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, near a barrel of five liters of beer from the brand Kaiser, stands a well-built bearded beard that shows about 200 visitors to the beer festival what deep sounds its throat can produce.
Elena first taps Luca, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near Puorta nueva station, four buses take the departure tonight at 23h45, `destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', arrival scheduled at 6h30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses travel Brazil exclusively.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are singing gold and already next to their flag, they have already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it is not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with faux fur and glasses with large silver frames.
For the past five years, they have been going to the beer festival, already three trips this year alone.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and return at 10h30pm.
Spending the night would involve unnecessary costs, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian Purity Law, health insurance and a head of the German speaking group - Marco did a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses run in the night on the Autostrada direction `Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes quiet on the bus, travelers sleep.
That's better, they'll still need their strength.
Breaks will be taken in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while many other buses with Italian license plates take a break again shortly before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning, Marco's group finally arrives at six thirty as planned in the parking lot near Place Thérèse, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First: to style the small yellow cap.
Top is written on the left `Beer Festival', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency `conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: `When the doors of the marquee of the beer open, we run', shouts Marco in the early morning.
`Run!' Run and reserve the seats at the bottom of the tent.
`Not in front, otherwise you block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, you have to spread them in the room!'
The chop, shouts Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the instruction!
`Show security guards that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they are gone!'
Third: `Tonight, to have returned here at ten and a half hours!' Understood?
And that's it, it's up to the beer party.
On the way, someone ties yellow caps to the trees to find the way, to the signs and even to an electoral poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the `Eatian weekend'.
There are no precise figures; we are talking about 50 000 who are getting on their way through the Alps and collapsing in the beer kiosk, 10 percent of the visitors would have come on Italian's express this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tirol, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian red cross who make a statistic on the countries where the Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by Italians is the tent of the brewery Hofbräu.
Nights of Insomnia for Hypo Real Estate Shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted just a few weeks ago.
How fortunate that the politician used the word `relatively' and that he slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This happened this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), side of the DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a credit of one billion to protect itself from the turbulence of the markets.
A person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that aid credits are issued up to an amount of 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
Money comes from both private and public-law banks.
In the background, it is the company-daughter Depfa that bears the losses.
According to a newspaper article, the state financier had refinanced itself in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which has not been possible since because of mistrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, and the own capital rate had also slightly declined from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
The outstanding profits and the net profits from financial transactions were, compared to the same period in the previous year, fallen to point zero, the profits from the allocation of specified debts and securities as well as the termination of provisions in credit operations had fallen from more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
And it is only thanks to the large profits derived from the repayment of downstream accounting costs resulting from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern companies that the deficit of gains of about 16 percent has proven to be moderate.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financier had initially misspeculated on industrial mortgages, which had then been subsidiaryized to the bank Aareal.
Because conventional state financing was not profitable enough, the Depfa had then engaged more intensely in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private investors and the State (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the daughter-story company, the Hypo Real Estate must make depreciation that should have on the calculation of the gains and losses of the group an essential material effect that remains quite unclear.
The fact is that the dividends have been cut.
Already for 2007, they had been truncated two-thirds.
Since the acquisition of the Depfa, the Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important state and infrastructure investor.
It is stronger than other refinancing-dependent institutes on the inter-bank market since it has no customer deposit.
With the bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of credits between banks has again dried up considerably, with the banks having accumulated liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a part - about 50 billion euros - of all the appropriations of the Depfa of a medium in the short term of refinancing.
According to a statement from the Hypo Real Estate, the group's need for financing is covered with medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets largely out of the state of operation currently.
Other sources say that refinancing would be provided through the funds until the end of 2009.
The chairman of the executive committee of HRE Georg Funke, on the other hand, explained that the Hypo Real Estate group should no longer have to resort to financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institution for the Supervision of Financial Services (Bafin) assume that the capacity of the Hypo Real Group in the market is now assured.
The bank's shareholders and creditors have only to hope.
However, given the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Moreover, it is not unthinkable that funding should not be used in all its extent.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest press releases, still at the gates of insolvency Sunday at the end of the evening, this temporary rescue will not succeed in reassuring the spirits either.
The stock price fell from 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are doing particularly well.
While debts in the first place have barely moved, the prices of second-term loans are falling.
The most affected are mainly the investment funds of the former daughter-staff Württemberg Hypo and those of course that have a lifespan beyond 2009.
The bonds of the bank Hypo Real Estate previously seemed to be an investment of alternative speculation, now their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the very institute that brought the crisis into the establishment by the acquisition of the bank Depfa.
As long as issuing institutions, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, an arrears can be presumed over time.
Or will happen what no one dares to hope right now - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability that approached security has now become a simple well-founded hope.
This should reserve nights of insomnia primarily for long-term creditors on the decision whether to separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use what they drew a line to be a deferral of losses for the next few years to the next capital income tax of automatically levied stock gains.
German special forces were on hand for the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had sought Germany's help in resolving the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they never took action.
More and more details about the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are revealed.
According to the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
For example, both Federal Army and GSG 9 officials from the Federal Police Air Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from the Technischen Hilfwerk were at the scene of the release.
As the spokesman for the ministries communicated on Monday evening, German forces were not finally required, as hostage-takers released their prisoners and fled when they acknowledged the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian government has reportedly accepted the assistance offered by Germany to include it as a support force on the spot.
“It fortunately hasn’t happened to the point,” a spokesman for the federal Home Office said.
The aggressors had abducted in southern Egypt the group of tourists consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian escorts.
After their abduction in the desert in southern Egypt, the hostages were transbaunted in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers has so far remained vague, as have the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who were saved have since arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn't say anything about the details of the release.
In Berlin at this time, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", the five holidaymakers and special forces should have taken off aboard an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is scheduled to show up for the first day at the Tachibana Highschool, the girls start to laugh: the German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of class in Japan.
What I was excited about.
Already the way to school scared me.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes to the Highschool of Tachibana.
I must have found the way alone, fortunately I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be fixed as strictly as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students appear one after the other from eight o'clock, until at nine o'clock minus twenty, a round of the table begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me.
I’m not the type of person who likes to talk in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have the school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my foster mother, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
In this outfit, therefore, I appeared before the console, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all made low masses, pouffed with laughter and made signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii."
I already knew him because of my manga.
It belongs to the vocabulary essential to the survival of Japanese teenagers and means "cute, cabbage".
Then I quickly slipped in my place.
The girl next to me gave me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent had to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong resounded, I was beset in the rules.
Everyone was talking to who better, she was laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it's quite difficult to understand English Japanese.
During the break, they all pulled out their Bento.
My foster mother had also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something other than the miserable in German cases.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, a salad of cucumber and seaweed, fruit and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat exactly here in Japan.
Things have a weird appearance and a completely new taste.
What is certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the candied salted plums, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she prepared herself, and who is then prepared particularly carefully - in the hope of being able to do a little better the boy's knowledge during the break.
I read this in my mangas.
I'm curious to know if I could observe it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
I always answered:
"Because it fascinates me, what"
In the end, reading mangas is what I already prefer for years.
And in order to better understand the manga and the culture that is there, at one point, I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, we give them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is harsh, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I’ve never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has narrowly failed the 700 billion dollar bailout of the financial markets.
The Dow Jones was falling into the abyss.
With 227 votes to 2006, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the bailout in favor of the government’s financial markets.
Despite all the calls of U.S. President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that was to curb the chaos of the financial markets did not win the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the fans had desperately tried to convince opponents of the well-founded of this heavy 700 billion dollar plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called on MPs to vote in favour, though the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to have political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent, by 600 points.
The reason for this was the investors' concern that the state bailout could collapse.
He went back shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of the failure, fell again.
Experts are now planning further severe turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, approval and the House of Deputies and Senate are required.
Rats also have sensations
A rat or a cockroach is fleeing in the face of danger, does that mean he also feels fear?
The neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he is experiencing the same thing when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles of the answers to the question "What do you think you are true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having so far been able to prove it just as one cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the questions of feeling or in general consciousness, we enter into difficult-to-practice terrain because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is facing danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it kills, flees or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduct a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult to transpose our subjective experience to that of animals.
One aspect is that the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral Cortex (due to its participation in short-term memory and in the functions of direction and execution).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in other beings.
So at least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal Cortex, among which the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being even differs from other primates.
Another significant feature could lie in the linguistic nature of Man: much of his existence being related to language, this often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, the animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not to depend on language, it would surely influence it, so that animal consciousness, no matter how it is produced, would probably differ greatly from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness in other animals may look like.
If this, internal and subjective, is not measured or, because of this particular Hardware, analyzing based on our own experience, then its observation poses big problems for us.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily scientifically accessible.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happened in studies of the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick have followed, we focus more on the nerve correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: the two can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also emphasizes the weight of the prefrontal Cortex in the realization of the visualization.
But what happens for emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in a brain aware of its own activity.
What we refer to as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its aftermath, such as the reactions of the body) grips the living memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially man.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our voluble nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impute them to others than to ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from primitive activities arise in the regions of the body sensation of the Cortex and the brain stem, as well as Jaak Pankseep, which focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could quite participate in cross-sectional sensations of all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it is unbreakable.
Pankseep argues that what is fearful in Men and Rats is probably also felt as such in both cases: how could one nevertheless check whether rats and Men feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach is fleeing in the face of danger, but if he feels fear?
In my view, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Certainly, the nerve comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, however, cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem causing the sensations?
And even if we could prove this for humans: how could we demonstrate it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably completely different from ours (since human consciousness relies on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is marked on the nervous plane insofar as the same is measured in rats and in humans.
Since I do not explore the language and consciousness in rats, nor the sensations, I do not know if they exist.
One could judge this as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly knocking myself against a wall.
I am indeed a pragmatic emotion.
Platini, UEFA President: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government considers the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux to be a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European championships," Wasjunik said.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to do in both countries.”
In the schedule of construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two guests run after the deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could eventually be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste time anymore.
We have to work at maximum speed,” said Ukrainian League President Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA is constantly watching us."
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The management of the Polish football league PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The committee had met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act in the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We assured in a letter to the President of UEFA that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League have already been convicted in the previous season for mandatory relegation manipulation; in the end, the start of the League even had to be postponed to the last minute.
Organizers report an increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the coming months according to a study, the turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 percent.
Despite weak cyclical prospects, the Germans’ thirst for travel remains insatiable according to this study.
Regarding bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 percent compared to the same period the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) told Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey of the GfK Market Research Institute, increasing booking figures are already dominating in the fall months.
Thus the sales figure would have climbed to about 11 percent compared to 2007, confided the DRV.
The sources of these results are the GfK figures, which analyzes monthly booking data from 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the overall market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded.
Due to the low price of the dollar, travel to the US would be particularly in demand, the DRV said.
There, the increase in bookings would amount to about a Third.
Besides this, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our country would be particularly sought after destinations by the Germans.
Particularly organized trips are in high demand, explained the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising prices for energy and food products, the costs would be here "more easily calculable for the customer than for an individually organized trip".
Consumers can save money among other things with early booking discounts or All Inclusivie offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months too have been very well retained so that an increase in sales figures will be recorded again compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip fell in comparison with the previous year.
Dennis Quaid outraged counterattack
She wanted to promote for a new film, talked about her private life in an interview — and is now in trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has lifted the veil on her ex-adulterine Dennis Quaid.
He foams - and counterattacks.
A late Rose War for former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in an unsightly battle – in full view of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview with the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of the breakdown of the marriage: "Dennis was for a long time unfaithful, and it was very painful."
She would have become aware of the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The motive for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - is told the story of adultery.
The reaction of Dennis Quaid on his qualification as an unfaithful husband clearly fell: it would be "Monstrous", said this one to the "New York Daily News", 54 years old, that "Meg once again rehasses the history of our relationship and manipulates it".
It would be more "regrettable", that "the pain and upheavals involved in a divorce for each child are again revived in public" for their 16-year-old common son Jack.
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
Thus was his response to the claw stroke: "In any case, my life goes on.
I feel happy to have a wonderful family that is doing their best.”
Airline ticket prices and hotels drop
In the first half of 2008, hotel flights and nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, thefts would even be reduced to 50 percent.
Hotel flights and nights would have become advantageous again - this is the result of a study by financial services and travel provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and established, after a rise in prices in the first quarter, a sharp decline in earnings in the second quarter.
After prices in the hotel market have increased for years, hotel nights have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices were rising in 41 of the 48 European cities still examined by an average of 6.9 per cent compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear especially in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would lie for American Express in the low price of the dollar that led to a "desire for declining travel of American tourists".
Financial markets such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are held with a 26.3 percent increase, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was up in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, economy-class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights, which are highly fuel-consuming, even increased to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, economy-class ticket prices fell on average by 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, both in business and first-class, however, price changes were significantly less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter, they fell by 23.6 percent.
German domestic flights were even halved according to the study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would be on the one hand a weakening economic growth, explains the firm.
Demand would give way in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there is an increased pressure from competition under the "Open Sky" treaty, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe.
A sign of the tense situation is the removal by airlines of non-profitable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - they were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a simple goal and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first in the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not managed to find an eleven functional.
By Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Landing in disaster for international player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player did not return until late into the game and his shot was up against the goal frame.
His message was precisely worded, he had come out of his lips persuasively.
He knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," whistled Hermann Rieger in the hallway of the dressing room of the Hamburg arena.
Not much happened in the locker room, half-time was over and most had staled in their place.
Rieger has been for nearly three decades the physiotherapist of the HSV, he enjoys a great reputation like many former protagonists.
And that is why his request was received in the strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol agreed and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg chief coach Martin Jol.
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second goal!
The practice was lacking.
"Everything was not very beautiful to see today," Marcel Jansen later confessed.
Bastian Reinhard "also wished to be more relaxed."
This 1:0 (1:0 at half-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful head strike by Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak Gladbach players could not hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
"It was a bad victory," said Marin Jol.
The SV of Hamburg will celebrate this Monday its 121 years.
Already on Saturday afternoon, the fans celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking boards on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first in the class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to step back,” said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictable character of the first League than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late-committed arrivals - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen debauched of FC Bayern - is certainly slowly forming, but it does not shine yet.
“We need more charm and more dribbling,” Jol demanded.
My first time at the Beer Festival
Ballermann's or Apres-Ski's hits continuously, beer in liter pitchers and celebrities in designer's Tyrolean costumes.
An event at the beer festival.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She is blonde, TV host and wears a custom-made zipline suit.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers throw themselves at us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and this on my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap zip line costume seems to reach its goal.
As a beer festival tourist and normally living north of the Weißwurst equator, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was until now limited.
But once on Place Thérèse, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears a zipline suit or leather pants; no one looks jaded or affected by shame - that's completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean costume gets a few weird shots of eyes at the banana-chocó stand.
A Bavarian woman points out to me that I would have mistached my apron: "on the left means free, in the virgin environment, on the broken right, in the widowed back."
Discreetly, I tripatouille my loop from the back to the left.
“It’s better,” she said and laughed.
Others do not give themselves as much trouble for these subtle techniques of flirting and carry simple felts, on which is written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and exposes us their bare hindquarters without being invited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, arrives from England and comes for the first to the beer party.
He finds it "slicer", with an elongated "ooooo".
He tells me all this after getting relieved of the mug he'd been drinking before.
Directly next to that fire hydrant that everyone thinks is a trash can.
Bob is one of those infamous "savage pissors."
Others don't have the chance to get rid of alcohol this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, bunches of rescuers run on the place of the party and must take care of the poor drinkers.
Nurses intervene rather in packs - always by four, they drag their stretcher covered with tents in tents.
It works this way for most visitors to the beer festival: we go there empty, we come back full.
Those who rest in the coffin of the stuffed under the tarp are not visible.
"They are the ones who can no longer swallow anything," one of the rescuers shouted in response to my question and then disappeared into the fray.
After the vote failed
On Wall Street, fear circulates.
The first news of the bailout's failure caused the Dow Jones to fall temporarily by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day in history.
Later, the Dow Jones made up a little.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world’s largest stock index stood by 10,579 points with a decline of well five percent.
The Nasdaq technology stock index was at 1548 points with a decline of more than seven points.
The most losing of the Dow Jones were on this date American Express which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No stock could yield any more profits.
Bank Goldman Sachs shares fell by almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffett had partnered with the company.
As part of the rescue plan, resources must be mobilized for the purchase of so-called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the sum should not be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company that can be exchanged in accordance with the evolution of the price in order to reduce the burden on the Treasury.
Stock prices sucked into the whirlwind in Europe and the United States
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not address investor concerns.
The stock price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones Index collapses despite the state’s planned financial market rescue.
Dramatic declines in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The share of the Bavarian real estate financier has lost three-quarters of its value at times despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, Commerzbank has declined by more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped below the large psychological bar of 6000 points and stood at 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
Worldwide, equity markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s 700 billion-dollar heavy bailout could not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 points lost in the opening first hour 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The U.S. House of Representatives intended to vote on the bailout, with the Senate voting expected to follow on October 1st.
The other European stock exchanges also have only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index has declined for the moment by 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris has lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s main Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after a rise initially of 1.26 percent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index slipped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 points.
In the MDAX, Arcandor shares fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The multinational commercial and tourism company also reported that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during what are called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
Because of fuel conductions soon frozen, cryogenic death threatens it.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused disarray among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a maneuver of space probes, whereby they obtain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, the Earth for example.
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, just like the solar probe Ulysses.
This is what has been surprising researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave at 100 percent of the way it is expected according to the venerable laws of gravity.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the speed.
Probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They named him the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the pulling force of matter because of the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study still believes hard as iron that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support with the help of what is called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
“Dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also close to Earth,” he wrote.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is to say that it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, dark matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days at the hands of their captors, tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released as well as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the pre-release shooting, six hostage-takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
The negotiations for the ransom would already be initiated.
The Germans are constantly in the crosshairs of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This was communicated in concert by Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health,” said Frattini.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts are doing well and are safe, announced the Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants of the desert excursion should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the hostages are still unclear: so the kidnappers were said to have been about to stop the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security guard, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without warning.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom,” the agent said.
All that remained was to collect the hostages, when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers shot dead six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money was to be given by the German woman of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men had to be held back until the kidnappers had found a safe road to flee.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the story.
Accident victim identified by police
A 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in Friday afternoon's accident in the city on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but later died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Abuse of a father-in-law" who led to suicide"
A court was told that years of abuse by her father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after admitting eight counts of indecent assault.
The tribunal de grande instance of Truro has referred that he regularly bends his daughter-in-law, Stéphanie Randle, during her childhood, from 5 to 7 years old.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that 34-year-old Miss Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and bandaged her before forcing her into sexual acts, while her mother was working at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 80's, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, a National Trust volunteer, was haunted by the abuses inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends said that Miss Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had since 2006 appeared to have been "emotionally dead", and "had lost all life expectancy."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
We think she committed suicide by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
M. Randle confronted the father-in-law of his daughter who had otherwise written a confessional letter that ended like this: "I tied her up and bandaged her regularly."
“I didn’t sexually abuse her.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You're really weird as a fetishist, your victim must be certainly terrorized, especially at the age of 7.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the suicide of the victim.
And what is even more surprising is the fact that if she had not committed this gesture, her story would certainly never be over in court.
He added: "I emphasize in particular, as described by his father and mother, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
"Without these, she would probably be today a happy, promising, and successful young woman."
Conviction for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office minister officer who had forgotten top secret documents, in June on a train, will be condemned by the Official Secrets Act, known the BBC.
The Defence Department man was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents passed into the hands of the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said the episode had a lot of people from Whitehall.
“They will have thought that this case would have remained within the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office,” he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of a violation of section 8.1 of the act, i.e. the clause which deals with the safeguarding of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the Ministerial Officer be placed under the guardianship of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associated Committee of the Secret Service
The documents he lost contained assessments of Al-Qaeda and the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret location.
Building companies facing the B&B invoice.
British construction companies may have to pay a bill of more than £80 million, to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The Government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingleys’ 2.6 million savers.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that raise money from investors, including 59 construction companies.
The general manager of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it is "irritating" to know that companies and their members will have to pay for the broken pots...
The £14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are cleared.
But the interest that will at the same time increase will be debited, each year, to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building companies are included in this list.
It is irritating to see that institutions that have behaved cautiously... now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company must pay a sum proportional to the deposits it holds, and that intermediary companies have to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will be £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the interest of the first year.
Adrian Coles, director general of the commercial committee of construction companies, told the BBC that the decision seemed unfair to him.
It is "irritating" to see that institutions that have had cautious behavior when the real estate market is taken over, now have to pay for institutions much less cautious.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first annals.
“We need to look at all aspects of this case for the next few weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to prevent building companies and their members from paying this salty bill,” Mr. Cole.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, it will be necessary to pay the interest of the whole year, which could also double.
Since construction companies are organizations without a shareholder, their member ends up paying the bill either by higher charges, or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought of joining the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter its hinterland.
On the east side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps from Asia, is one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha Station was designed in a neo-renaissance style, by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that’s what the guides tell us.
The monument is placed on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation towers at each of its corners, such as some German provincial town halls.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticketing, we have no more doubt as to the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, late to the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad as well as the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding area, engendered by the icy borders of the Cold War, is over.
. The British and the forces of the empire advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha Station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say it is sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, swallowed up in the meanders of history.
But today, the railway passage to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, to underline the expansion of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding area, engendered by the icy borders of the Cold War
Now it's time for a new policy of commitment.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on a sleeper car to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit MP AKP Turkish Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a 10-and-a-half-hour journey, shaken on noisy rails whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived, in the Turkish capital - presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning its back on its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamist roots, is an example of a change in the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and especially Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure, expressly built of stone and steel, in a developing neighborhood, surrounded by half-built shopping centers and by many pastries in which middle managers in suit-tie-men and women- meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
"the purpose of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey now into its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case for both.
She had to do both.
"But, now, at some point, "I asked if" should Turkey not choose?"
“Turkey,” he said, “does not want to have to choose between the two.”
He then pointed out an aspect that almost all those with whom I have been able to speak, recited to me by heart: The Turkish railway does not only go to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, it is therefore, both an advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe traveling metaphorically on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha train station, after another night without sleep, I rethought these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey.
While I was waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period during which Turkey had been named "the patient of Europe".
At least there is no longer any doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Milk increases up to five penny per litre
People in Jersey have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk, by five penny per litre, starting Monday.
This is the second increase in the price that follows a two-penny increase in February, and comes following a search by a consulting firm.
Retail sellers must decide whether they will go in turn, raise the price to consumers.
. Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk was last varied in 2002.
Former Bangladeshi PM denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request to former PM Sheikh Hasina, which is at risk of arrest on his return home.
Her lawyers said the court refused to give her bail because of her indictment for extorting from a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729,000.00) when she was PM.
This case is one of many accusations made to him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina’s ever-thinking rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh within a few weeks, but his party, the Awani League, has demanded that the country’s provisional military government give it its full freedom first.
Correspondents stressed that the terms of her release are contradictory because if she is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why she could not remain free upon her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court Order.
“The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina’s request that it does not require bail since it had been allowed to go abroad for medical reasons,” his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We will make an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country in order to prepare for the December election
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, a former Awami party leader said.
She was detained last year after the interim military government assumed power, but was released in June to treat himself abroad.
Sheikh Hasina, like Zhaleda Zia, deny the charges against them.
Concerns about the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign, due to Taliban-related violence, the UN said.
The UN carried out a vaccination campaign in the six provinces last week.
But she says she does not manage to contact the children of the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located to the south.
A UN spokesman said it happened despite Taliban promises not to attack or obstruct the thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses ITV's legal battle
BSkyB lost his trial following the Competition Commission's verdict, which would force him to reduce his stake in his rival transmitter ITV.
The Competition Appeals Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and allowed it to unjustly influence ITV.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 following an agreement to effectively prevent NTL, now known as Virgin Media, from purchasing ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Office reported that the purchase by BSkyB of ITV's shares raised doubts about the effective independence of ITV, thereby prompting the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin boss Richard Branson, a consumer group and regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB countered that forcing it to reduce its shares of ITV would not be reasonable and on the contrary was excessive – especially since BSkyB has just waived its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of American prosecutors.
The U.S. attorney general appointed a special accuser to verify the issue of firing nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole thing was born from the report of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical of White House officers, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special Accuser Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators, obstructing justice.
“Serious, potentially criminal, unfounded charges of conduct have not been fully confirmed or resolved,” Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to testify was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the December 2006 delisting of nine U.S. prosecutors by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had stated that prosecutors were dismissed because of poor benefits.
But it then emerged, that the dismissed prosecutors were no more criticized than their other colleagues, which prompted some observers to attribute to these dismissals a political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors have been accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others have reportedly refused to investigate accusations of fraudulent voting against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute courts for the government.
It is certain that they can be fired at any time, but cannot be for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, finished accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and in the end he resigned.
A number of ministerial officers from the Department of Justice have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr's role. Gonzales in this case, stating that he considered him "first responsible" for these layoffs, and eventually "abdicated" his role as leader," succeeding remarkably in not involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including Bush’s former collaborator, Karl Rove, were critical of failing to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic will have to be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honored at the Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London, next week, said he was "honored" to get the recognition.
The nine-minute, fifty-second song was the title of the 1977 hit of Meat Loaf's album.
The awards evening is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a selection restricted to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely part of it
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a big voice like Meat Loaf's.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song went commercial in the UK, as a single in 1979, ranking in fifteenth place.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in the English charts, and was sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of his real name - has suffered from a health problem in recent years, even undergoing an operation to cure his heartbeat turned irregular, after falling apart on stage, in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngite forced him to cancel concerts.
Then he was found a cyst in the vocal cords.
A Dark Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and Can Be on Sale Soon.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
. And even some veteran taxis as well as long-time local residents can’t give hints to go to Extra Place, because they’ve never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and travels north of First Street - not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 long, it looks like a dusty driveway rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repaver Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to shops and boutiques, which should open in new buildings.
Other admirers including long-time neighbors, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because there is one of the last and oldest streets of the block.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that manages the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighborhood owner committees, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal allowing the builder to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to stay in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No. 3.
“There are only a few space left in the city, and we would like the city to retain Extra Place,” she said.
"They could offer to rehabilitate it and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to repave the small street and install seats, some would be used by a coffee shop to which the manufacturer will concede the space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, the spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to operate the street, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s main interest is to relook this abandoned driveway, and make it public,” she said, noting that it was the city to suggest the sale to her.”
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Real Estate Preservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, further stressing that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been named after this name since 1802, when the legacy of the great farm of the many children of Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since remained abandoned.
The later entrance to the CBGB, a closed punk rock monument in 2006, has reopened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of scrap, rags, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the evolution towards luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rarity – a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be ruined in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Protests: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at A City in the Extinction Process") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small, narrow cul-de-sac, dark day and night, and delimited by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and louvers, full of newspapers from last week that fly along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street always has the same pace.
A rat runs agilely to the back of the alley, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and has now become the seat of a fancy clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, a bottle of 22-ounce empty beer, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
Some passers-by reported rarely thinking about Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
M. Field, for his part, said he thought that some underestimated the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “have taken place in dark, damp and disgusting places.”
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former member of the studies in California, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as Good as You Thought. Why the middle classes should be able to choose their school. "
Attracting the favor of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are an interesting example.
The campaign of M. Obama points out that “African-American and Latino students have a less chance of declusing than white students.”
To combat these differences, Mr's education programme. Obama supports in particular among many other topics, "bilingual transitional education" for those learning English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve a bilingual education that defends instruction in language classes other than English, goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are mostly Hispanic, and low incomes.
More than a third of the students, made up of many newcomers, study English.
Among the students of the CM1, 100% passed the state math exam of 2008, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students passed the English-Art Language Exam
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient than that advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street relies on analysis, practice, constant assessment of abilities and exemplary attitude.
Besides, and here's an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, principal of the Sixth Street, this school has instituted the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
Total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Miss Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without her class, you would have had no chance to identify her."
"It works," she observes, "it worked for us"
M. Shouldn’t Obama take the example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools composed mostly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education, obscure the prognostic of Mr. Obama.
Although he is in favour of the fact that immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama recently considered this issue to be insignificant, when he proclaimed that we must all stop polemicizing about the wording of English-language laws.
"On the contrary, he said, "you must make sure that your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate differences, so he should consider carefully, the models of education that work, rather than disdaining them or considering them insignificant.
Net Oil Fall Following New Concerns of the World of Economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday, as people fear that the bailout in favor of financial marches will succeed in bringing the economy back to life.
Crude oil futures operations fell by 7 percent reaching $99.80 per barrel. The Mercantile Stock Exchange in New York, during this morning's sales.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by Wall Street’s financial unrest, as well as two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After experiencing an increase in July to $145.29 per barrel, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, before rebounding again in view of the deep uncertainties of financial markets.
On Monday, investors are again worried despite the bailout agreement, the largest in history, concluded this weekend by congressional leaders.
The news has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis is harsh.
In the latest episode of this financial disaster,” Citygroup will purchase the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, the government said Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that this weekend’s frantic negotiations, concluded with the rescue agreement “seem not to have succeeded in reviving the market.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow down.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rates and market exchange, has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors.
"we believe that the raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
“As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus would spread globally and in particular, in China.”
Bank analysts cut expectations for next year, given the drops in oil consumption due to slowing economic growth, were therefore forced to decrease by 20 percent, oil and gas price forecasts for 2009.
The Determining Second Day Festival for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After spending in the past eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Shaun Ellis Jets uniform, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He looked at the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like this," Ellis said.
The second time began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals played dirty under dark clouds.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a precursor sign of an afternoon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from halftime.
"I didn't get out of my zone" Favre said about all his passes to Coles.
"He's a mediocre player"
"We communicated extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing wrestling, the defense was beating the Cardinals quarterback, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards until the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted her.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of Bowens' balloon, may well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a 20-yard goal taking a advantage from 34 to 0.
It was the best that the Jets could score in a time.
"The Jets coach, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said "the second or the third?"
When he was told the two--the Jets missed 21 undisputed points in the third time- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second time more than the third.
." Many points were scored in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, exceeds his world record.
Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again proved worthy of his title as the best back-country runner of the century, after breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4minutes.
With a 2:03:59 win of an accommodating race on the loose, Gebrselassie broke his record of 2:04:26, played last year in Berlin by 27 seconds.
At 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career during which he won the world championship or world record for any distance, from the 1600meter marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic Marathon, fearing – perhaps exaggerated in today’s eyes, – that air pollution will increase his asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees at the start, 55 at the finish - Gebrselassie won on Sunday, now an impressive average of one mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into long distance runners, have contributed to the decline in the marathon record of more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazil’s Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05.
After Sunday's win, Gebrselassie told reporters, suffered from calf cramps two weeks before, and missed training for a week.
It is obvious that rest allowed him to remain bright, but not rusted.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
“Everything was perfect.
I got back to it last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went well."
He was criticized – especially in Kenya, the rival is African of Ethiopia – for having orchestrated his races too much, avoiding the world marathon stars, actually counting on hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering more world records than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the magnitude of Gebrselassie’s abilities as a long-distance runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. halfway.
Two Kenyan elite riders, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the leaders disappeared.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final comeback to break away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis came third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year getting the seventh time of 2:19:19.
England’s Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone who won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She could not participate in the Beijing games because of a hypothetical back pain, but promised to win in Berlin, improving in her third marathon, her personal best of almost five minutes.
She ran using a clever strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to take a nice advantage, then exceeding them about 18miles 1⁄2 after.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia came second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyan, finished third in 2:25:01.
In a City in Part, Pride and the Trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its huge park, a few miles from the sun, the bright and the giant Orlando, is a small quiet town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first all-black city to integrate, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to do today." The city at five lakes, three croquet courts,, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guyavas, two schools and no prison.
It has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival held annually in Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer in the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city it describes – has become touristy thanks to its inclusion in the Florida’s tourist guide published by The Depression – era Federal Writers’ Project – remains a place apart.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was already in the 30's, when Hurston told that the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share their true thoughts with the white man, who "knowing us so little, doesn't know what he's losing."
Even though it is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has invoked an open dialogue on the theme of race, many here remain cautious of the eyes of the foreigner.
“We are very careful about how to tell the story,” said Hortense Jones, 59, who has always been a resident and the city’s oldest parishioner.
"it must be in accordance with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of a black takeover and a community of almost 2400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
This is a central point but also an example of southern black rural culture – sometimes disdained, other times acclaimed – reminiscent of the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world through sincere books, full of dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed this city, located just outside Route 17, a road that crosses the often-forgotten center of Florida that ends up in a chapter of black history and human drama.
Bold as a bass drum in both life and literature, Hurston led readers to the home store of Eatonville's first mayor, Mr. Joe Clarke, who was later divided into several private parties.
"Passed the Road on the Left," she writes, "you'll find the modern brown and white public school, with its gardens and those well-preserved playgrounds that Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he can barely read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can be used by people.
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with a self-government but also with anilitacy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor was not that way.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone appreciated.
Zora described reality well, "said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's young girls that Hurston immortalized, citing colorless songs, performed by men who praised their beauty."
She added: "Some people did not appreciate."
Hurston is always remembered as a lively and eccentric person, who came back frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in the city without warning, aboard a fat Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed at her.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” he said.
But he also adds, swinging in his chair of the back patio that overlooks Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten about it.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman of Barnard College of the 20's, she was buried in any grave, in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no major commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don’t think they understood the contribution or legacy she offered the world,” said Valérie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment came in the 1980’s.
Orange County public officials wanted to take a five-lane highway in the city to replace Boulevard Kennedy, the community's two-lane main street.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the western corner of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 50's, the dispute over the mix of races led hatred to the gates of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of young whites came to throw oranges or objects at people sitting on the side," said Mr. Franklin.
"A lady even died. "
They threw a watermelon from their car.”
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court’s request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorifying my race."
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, while positive in some aspects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened youth confidence.
"Black children used to be kissed- I remember it well-we kissed our master in the morning, and in the evening too," N.Y said. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and chief director of the Safeguarding of the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, she added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
“You don’t kiss your white teacher because he’s white – I mean there’s a cultural demarcation line here,” Nathiri said.
Civil rights, moreover, have made it possible to create space for many other Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the prejudice, such as it, armed with a joyful confidence of its own and guidelines such as: "how can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
It exceeds me.”
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Hurston's unnamed grave and began struggling to revive his reputation.
Five years later, a biography acclaimed on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, reintroduced her to the American canons.
The highway project came just as Eatonville’s most famous girl had regained her appeal.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors consider her a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the festival’s inauguration two years later, and many return in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the table has rejected the proposal of the highway.
“The five-way highway fiasco, extremely fast, a real civic pride,” said Melle. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd summed it up, stating that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been a historic city since 1998.
A mono-theme library (of course renamed Hurston) opened in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, repaved.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a back street on a summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(There are now 90 percent black)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, his raison d'être, are still treated with caution.
One must ask permission for most interviews, and some things – like the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields – should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Miss Jones, a courageous teacher who has a soft spot for the bright red, are always afraid that their island community is well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston Festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular, tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered his entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but also proud, creative, hardworking, crazy and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is indeed sincere civic affection that is heard in the voice of Mr.'s nephew. Franklin, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or the police force, who need additional forces.
And even for the youngest, like 11year old Alondra and Alexia Kenon, twins of Winter Park, seem to have learned correctly the description Eatonville.
"Most people, who pass in this area, will think: 'Oh, this city has nothing compared to others' Alondra Kenon said after Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it is a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, everyone speaks fluent finance.
Even so, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the kiosk and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize they are in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think that in the glass and honeycomb offices above their head, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst "day of work in the office" since the crack of 1929.
Delivery people continue to sneak on the sidewalks, with their carts and muffin trays for morning meetings.
The Latinos always drag between residential buildings wearing, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging from a yoke arranged on his shoulders.
Office workers continue to queue to buy their morning sandwich from street vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4pm and 7pm on weekdays.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to go open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work in the late afternoon, because I discovered at my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, about twenty people waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashiers' counters, nor to withdraw from the cash or make a payment, but in front of the customer service counter, where the usual customers ordered their checkbooks, tourists asked for direction for the Macy store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "authorized personal banker", all lined up for the same reason as me.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They withdrew their money from the savings accounts called thrifts (such as a construction company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that only operate in one state, and that say they treat customers like their families.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327 bank capital, has used the trustee in bankruptcy, and as New Yorkers were returning home for the weekend this Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with savings accounts worth $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and store workers in front of me, afraid of another potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable to them, the one that does the most rescue on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and its meager general manager Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she might have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed janitor of my building, changed the topic of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries of my fruit and vegetable dealer.
She told me after my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the money market.
“I’ve changed, I don’t want to take any risks.”
Memoirs of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Music Director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died 11 September) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was to include under-21s, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20-year-old refused to give up the choir.
The denomination "Proteus" (which changed its form according to mythology) represented the will and the ability of the choir to manage any type of music was presented to it, whether madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He said, "The composer knows what he wants"
It's all in the music.
So sing!"
His baguette technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if ever dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver were to be named a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
For the last 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me - and, a few times, they even inspired me
Tod Handley held this combination of greatness and personal modesty so rare.
He hated drivers who, according to him, "only focus on certain people."
He will be missing from many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (died 25 September) states that "in 1946 he had resumed his studies in economic history, at Oxford, and in 1950 became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while he was doing a BSc, an MA and a PhD."
This is what comes from the letter of the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but this is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was Professor of Economic History at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers was published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at the Norman Hop, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to hide that part of his past remains unknown.
Muslim tombs desecrated as Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and, Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization of the "cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs illustrating mosques striped in red.
Police accuse far-right extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the weekend of the victory of far-right political parties in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged in the cemetery of Traun, near Linz, between the night of Friday and this morning; according to the police, this is an organized action.
The offenders painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; however, detectives believe that this could have been done to disguise the extremists' feeling of hatred towards Muslim immigrants.
Could this accident be somehow related to the elections?
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said he was "deeply shocked" at the announcement of the desecration, which comes just during the religious month of Ramadan that is coming to an end.
Austria is seriously thinking about regaining its courage, following its oscillation to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that won almost 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, ran an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, to be xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party that won more than 18 percent of the vote, ran his campaign against the wearing of the scarf and the burkas, and even expressed his opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out just after the elections, defined the extreme right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter banned from travelling abroad.
The courts have banned glamorous rock star Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he expressed its intention to travel to Spain through France to the authorities under control.
The police in Kent granted the travel ban last Thursday after proving Glitter’s guilt over child sexual abuse to the magistrates.
Glitter, or of his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing at the courts of limited jurisdiction in Ashford, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said "On Thursday, September 25 in the Ashford court, Kent police have requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd travels to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd wasn't there then."
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, even if it means being registered in the list of accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years in prison.
Kent police said they would not discuss specific cases or Glitter's potential movements in the lay.
A Kent Police spokesman said "Kent police will do everything necessary to protect our children like those abroad.
“In our opinion, it is easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because we have devices capable of handling any potential risks, much more efficiently.
"Protecting Kent residents is the most dear intention to the Kent Police, and we are closely monitoring the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the area, in order to minimize potential risks to the public."
. Glitter returned to the UK last month, after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, respectively, aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok from where he should have boarded for a flight to London.
But he said he did not feel good, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from passport control, and in the end he went to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, and was therefore forced to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on August 22 and, remained there while his lawyer, David Corker, was going to the Uxbridge Court of Limited Jurisdiction, West London, to record him on the list of people accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been served a four-month sentence in the UK for holding images of child abuse.
A Interior Ministry source said that Jacqui Smith, the interior minister, was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter had been banned from travel in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master off the stage to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no strange clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in these moments unknown to the general public, where we discover intimate gestures and stolen looks of artists who do not care to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser-known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer takes the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "may be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists able to transmit on stage passion, sadness, joy ... by captivating the public.
To capture moments of personality of these artists, you must not take photos on stage.
They have a personality and a character of their own.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera moments of personality of the flamenco stars ".
With the festival "Chant populaire des Mines", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and equipment, recalls classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not about the dance or the singing itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captivates the public with his art.
The search for the essentials and the magic was the constant of this work that is presented these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy artists photographed.
The project has evolved into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book of collection of portraits exhibited in the gallery.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of old sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves photographing the portrait of people, knowing them and being able to enter their lives for a more or less long moment.
I think that in photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters that sometimes you don’t know or that only leave you a few minutes to be able to give them a photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco entitled "Flamenco - people", is on display at the Galerie El Fotómata, located at number 20 rue de la Mata (street parallel to the Persolventary of Hercules) which will be open until October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true boldness"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project he is working on, a novel that has as its main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived twenty years in Congo and who has passed through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize winner of Literature confessed yesterday at the Hay festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies it "is a real boldness" and that "everything demonstrates that he should not write it".
“If I were reasonable, I wouldn’t, but I’m going to do it and I hope to finish it,” he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchanging ideas and thoughts that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people march through the city of the aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most anticipated figure in the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award by a majority of the participants’ voices, made a packed room at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, found himself in front of a fascinated audience that did not see the past hour during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, retraced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote in a "very methodical way"his "lack of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspire his novels.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure amusement, a fleeting experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less similar", because writers were asked "not to indulge in frivolity" and to assume their vocation.
Bad weather spoils the Pozoblanco fair
The banderilla festival that concluded the bull races of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the roasteaders on horseback checked that the arena was impractical.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather was fierce on this fair, since finally two out of three parties could not take place.
Saturday is the rain that prevented the celebration of the second scheduled bull race.
On the bill, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who should have competed in the arena of Castilblanco
Only the Friday party took place
Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was carried in triumph, after making arm movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the discovered bleachers applauded more than his fight in itself with the bull.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a markedly better fight, he was whistled by most of the public.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hashish found
Five hours minus ten of the morning.
Traffic control of the Euskadi police (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter two begin the leak.
Its load, more than two tons of hashish, enough to stop them.
The police chased them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A. A. J., according to information leaked by the Interior Department of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was charged with drug trafficking and falsification of documents.
The incident occurred when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a control of the vehicles on the N-1, on the border of the Municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed the orders, abruptly accelerated and control began.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers away on the aisle, where the two occupants descended to flee to a wooded area.
Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hachish bales. Then they transferred him to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate had been "falsified" since it did not coincide with the one written on the van's registration card, which is also why they charged the prisoner with a crime of falsification of documents.
The Ertzintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The inmate, A. A. J. of 28 years, has been taken into custody to carry out the various procedures and will be judged in the hours that follow.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the effect of medication
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the television series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara, California for driving under the effect of a drug.
A witness saw her make strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, from what a California police patrol spokesman told People magazine.
The witness said that around 4:30 p.m., Locklear "pressed the accelerator thoroughly, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going backwards several times, she rolled on her sunglasses."
Shortly after, the witness, who initially did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and exited his vehicle.
This person, at that time, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She looked disoriented", that's why the agents took her to the center specializing in drugs and alcohol to perform a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the alcohol abuse was ruled out from the beginning, although "according to the observation of police officers at first glance, we thought that Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the effect of a substance that was not specified and was incarcerated around 19.00 hours and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was interned to treat a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares asked the Andalusian federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to make a decision on the case of the former councillor of Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of carrying out preferential treatment to the members of his family.
“In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities,” Llamazares said of the behavior of the political party he will have to adopt in Seville City Council.
However, the leader of the United Left has asked that the investigations be "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended this kind of case so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all civil servants".
"Sangre de Mayo", Garci's dared bet
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in "Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly 15 million euros in budget.
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film lasting more than two and a half hours, "Sangre de mayo" will release in theaters next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós literature, José Luis Garci assures having realized with this shooting "a dream of a child" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who instructed him, three years ago, to shoot a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May 2 Madrid, something he has always accepted when the story was related to national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Municipality of Madrid constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothes the atmosphere of "a Spain that has made the wrong leader for the fight, since, the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained a funding as for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double that obtained for "Sangre de mayo" - because he could not shoot some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated for almost all his career.
The filmmaker of "Volver a empezar" influenced his usual way of working, on the staging of the actors, with whom he is used to rehearsing before starting the shooting and to whom he does not cast, since it seems "humiliating" to him and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater and the cinema to keep himself informed".
Many actors in "Sange de mayo" rehearse in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four-time Oscar candidate (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Sangre de mayo", "Seven French pool tables" and finally the winner, "The blind sunflowers", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which deserves to be better known", he said.
With this film Garci does not expect a price.
“At first you think you’re working for posterity, then you realize that you’re only working for prosperity, and now you’re just making an extra movie,” Garci said after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón puts herself in the shoes of the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer will pay tribute to such a Sevillian dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and who at the age of three will live in London with her family.
She was a free dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of the woman, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and pleaded for the abolition of the corset, which prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe of the interwar period, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me to interpret the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we're not trying to tell her story but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "the dance of the butterfly" made me think of a popular Cuban dance and "the dance of the snake" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to hers,” she says.
The production was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again Isabela in one of his shows, as he had done at "La puerta abierta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who was exceptionally kind enough to collaborate with the one who was his student.
"Matilde turns Tórtola into a mature character.
I am happy because she has agreed to play a role in my work and that honors me.”
The production was also made thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song by Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the viole of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the
This work also tells, in a way, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in places so far away, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually resided in London.
“I wanted to remember it because I think it’s these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows and showcases her work,” Bayón said.
The show will start at 8h30pm at the Lope de Vega Theatre
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Le Flamenco et la vie" because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have attracted attention to me because of their simplicity and the strength they transmit and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys many feelings.
Resino can capture magical moments.”

The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Newly Married Poet's Journal" in the Church of St. Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennate Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the anniversary of the anniversary of the anniversary of the anniversary of the anniversary of the anniversary.
In this way, the "Triennate Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This poplar of light" which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling to the various Andalusian provinces, will go to New York
In the same way, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia bought eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a recently married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the best known Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of Malice", and illustrates the despair of American cinema, and all of America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had trouble getting an Oscar
He had not been shooting since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a blow to everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels is beyond expression, and now I’ve lost a great friend,” Robert Redford cried, “my life and my country were better because of his existence.”
No one was afraid to make themselves ridiculous or exaggerate.
One of the fathers of cinema and the homeland died during a particularly dark period, when terrorists and stock markets are scary, American esteem has fallen very low, desperately seeking motives for dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason for living, there is no rest for human beings but admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the anti-drug fight created in honor of his elder who died as a result of an overdose and the creation of his own brand of organic food.
It was a victory for a country that had trouble imposing itself against a suicidal food crop.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, the Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the peak of his career.
The bad boy who arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
“He set us the bar high,” said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who is trying to break through the screen like Paul Newman did: by being very honest and having a serious privacy and away from the goals.
It is still not easy or possible in the media jungle these days.
But there's the one trying, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even if he did not miss the opportunities not to be.
"But why should I eat a burger out of my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he attends with pride to meet his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America.
“Of all the great roles he’s played, he’s never been as proud as the devoted husband, father-in-love, caring grandfather and philanthropist,” he says.
Madrid in the race to organise the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can host the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, it could come true in 2016.
But I wonder if we are ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but in my opinion it was the worst race I've ever played.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be subject to a playoff note.
But let’s look at everything in detail and from the beginning.
The mistakes begin with the removal of the bibs, which forces you to go early.
It's not bad but if they make you move it would be better if they give you everything (including the chip for the races).
Well, no
They made you go there only to take the bib (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis they have decided to buy only small size jerseys with less fabric and therefore cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on race day.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to remove the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which the barracks took place.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, will not even appear in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me which, I think, did not mark the start properly.
Of course, if they asked me to quote an example of a perfect race, this one would not come to me.
So I believe that we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 O.J.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the conference on Emerging Technologies at Microsoft MIT was presented a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of accomplishing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to get around the company's campus) in response to what was asked of him during a conversation.
Through a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who they are - including remembering which positions they occupy - and listening and hearing the keywords of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but she understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking with her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks him if she is here to visit someone and she tells him that she will answer him in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course that represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its operational system, Windows.
This week we talked about a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if the computers were sold with the indispensable instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operational system is losing importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on Google to compete with Windows.
Several people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operational system.
The operational system will always be necessary since it is the essential basis for computer hardware and software to understand each other.
He holds the same position as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it must be seen as the "death" of the operational system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed the idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operational system but increasingly to the Internet browser.
We turn on the computer only to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who serves half of the applications supplied with the system?
Who can the least can the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, crowded month, less complex.
For the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need that, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo in this article, was taken earlier this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the beverage dispenser, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released in early 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will surely try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, is increasingly similar to a computer.
But the launch of Android being late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dearly.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso endorsed him on the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the holding of the muscular gay association.
And if we start to list all his appearances, we could also quote this strong mustachu who lifted weights in a traveling circus.
It's not just a simple men's cotton bodysuit, tight and sleeveless.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out among all the others.
First of all, by its flamboyant name - although it is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with the sport since it takes the name, according to legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel' is distinguished from the others by its excellent cotton, by its unisex cut, by its distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the most famous bodysuits have in the neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tank tops.
But she also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even though it's a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
Second assault for Honda super sales
In November Honda will begin commercializing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had good habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
To this is added some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more gasoline.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz has a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before looking at the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the first generation is put on the market.
First of all, we observe that Honda renovated this model in a shorter time than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Honda Jazz is less well known, this model is a sales phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case of Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazz has been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less a million cars sold in six years represents is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it thinks of selling 100,000, which would represent a growth in sales of 17% in the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002 which represents 6.7% of Honda’s sales in Spain.
The Spanish subsidiary hopes to sell 2,000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely offset the decline in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the managers of the brand hope to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 fewer cars that in 2007, a decrease in sales of 16%.
Thanks to this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also expects to get a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get that market share when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a five-door hybrid with a compact size - 4.37 meters in length - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
Depending on the market and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of the Insight's sales will be in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is scheduled for the first three months of next year, following its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change that is 1.52 meters.
Dimensions increase and the interior space also.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a reserve of gasoline in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
In the same way, the capacity of the trunk – which has a double bottom system – can hold up to 399 litres, 19 litres more capacity compared to the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 liters.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements like taillights or panoramic roof - is the improvement of access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, with respect to the rear doors of the first Jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two gasoline thrusters of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines feature i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine develops a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This thruster - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 liters per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous thruster, which on the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaches 100 horses.
This 100-horsepower Honda Jazz 1.4L has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres per 100 km and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
"I want to become a young mother; the candidate does not worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
It was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new head office but as well as the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I created for Mango for the new season autumn-winter, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
A very intense day but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
What is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 50's and 60's enchants us and we are very inspired by it for our collections.
I love walking around the city and watching women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you are a very versatile woman: right?
I believe that yes but in the end everything is joined and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was very small the clothes pleased me; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to look in my aunt's wardrobes and to see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I was always trying to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers love to dress well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you put on the clothes, that's when you really put yourself in the character's skin.
Suddenly, everything is connected.
You didn't have 30 years ago: was it hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30 years are rejoicing.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with fewer problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done all the things I wanted to do since I was a little girl and it gave me a lot of internal happiness.
So, do you think you're becoming a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mom because my body asks me and, moreover, I want to become a young mother; I don’t want to lose that.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's come to the movies, you're waiting for the various movies you shot last year to come out.
That's right, I can't wait for them to come out.
I am a woman from the theater, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I can't wait for the films 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' to release.
To see what you think...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't get on the bridge to make the model.
Quite simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I know her for quite some time, to invite me to participate in London in a charity parade for her association in favor of supporting women and the clothes we exhibited - I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold at auction to raise money for the NGO of Naomi.
The people that Naomi is a person with a tender heart.
They say so much about her, I know her, a lot of things are not true.
Also, this good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to march for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to make the pear tree, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the Third World.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the theft of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have made this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Research in Advanced Science and Technology at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the managing director of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Brand Management Development, the BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan safety shield.
This robot will allow vehicles of the brand to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space of an oval shape that closely resembles the Nissan safety shield.
But most importantly, it is the bee’s composed eyes, able to see in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption inside its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a Laser Range Finder.
The latter detects obstacles that are located over a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
“At the time it detects an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If this were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles, "says Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Travel Laboratory and the main engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can only be diverted upwards or downwards, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot could avoid obstacles.
" Every second this device must only process information and act according to that data.
It does not need to keep the information or intuitive logics of prior maneuvers, which is why it can operate continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes.”
This is the first to develop new technologies for the instantaneous prevention of collisions, a technology that will be introduced in production cars in a decade after Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last more than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device on a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Alcohol repeat offenders at the wheel will have to install the 'alcolock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for blood alcohol, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the start of the vehicle intoxicated, or if he does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and it is now reflected in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last one year.
Its purpose is the rehabilitation of the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State in charge of road safety but also the Directorate General of Road Safety and the Technological Institute Foundation for Automotive Safety will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once intoxicated, the car resumes.
The alcoholock would avoid this since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe before; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than that allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is the responsibility of the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of infringements during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people every year.
This measure is limited to administrative penalties for two reasons: to deal with these behaviours before they turn into criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means but, however, the reform made by penal means requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and function vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party which proposes to install this system in the school buses as it was done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 17h40 precise, official time scheduled, the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias was traveling was landing in the presidential hangar of the Benito Juárez airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve of sunset but its rays still forced to put their hands as a visor so that the royal couple could get off the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours before I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he was aware that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to finish their official trip.
- Ah, all right, so we won't be able to go to the airport to pick up customers at this time... Are you from here or...?
- No, no sir, I'm Spanish but I lived here thinking two years.
- Ah, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
Many are waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military row consisting of 27 navy soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, when she has hair in the wind, is dressed very soberly and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before passing into the room where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they stay, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny Mexican television journalist is waiting for them.
They are afraid of being mortgaged
It must be acknowledged that the Treasury of the United States, besides having a lot of liquid to make plans, is not devoid of geniuses.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from getting into mortgages with credit banks, they have created a game to learn not to go bankrupt: Bad Credit Hotel.
That is to say 'the hotel of bad credits' ... or stories.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially the Master of Hotel leads us to think several times if it is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it.
This game certainly gives useful but undetailed information.
It's more of a game for teenagers.
¿What to do if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's unthinkable to buy a house
The most prestigious prize in fashion
There is surely no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion prize than Paris and there is surely no living cartoonist more extraordinary and good live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talent.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian outgoing winner of the first edition, looked at her models in the window of Mango at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she cried almost with emotion.
Certainly it is the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first shop is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the competition, made us meet in a luxurious dinner at the opera Garnier in Paris.
With the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango, seems even more spectacular as a table next to the extraordinary Chagals family.
By having big on the heart and doing against bad fortune good heart, because of the recent death of his brother, Nati put a garment of Mango and some ornaments of ELAH, who were breathtaking, and arm on it, arm in arm with her son Luis - a handsome man almost two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to her dinner prepared in her honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as Baron de Rotchil ended the evening without a jacket because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store with pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner metamorphosed into a sleeping a sexy and black long dress, was moved when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet rehearsal room and remembering the good old days, she grabbed one of the bars and she made the gesture.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the palace outbuildings, but she showed us before on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another handsome man who travels by motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having asked beforehand, that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
It is not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to top it all off, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to the booksellers on September 30.
The alarm clock saddens us almost when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it's even worse when we think about the restless rhythm that the current life imposes on us.
The office is synonymous with tension and the computer has back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But well 1001, neither one more nor one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to the taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is called ‘1001 ways to relax’ and will arrive at the booksellers directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquility in places like work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline doesn’t run through your veins to restore your body’s balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind, and focus on reading.
Talking while sleeping
Some children speak during the night.
I do not relate to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who speak during their sleep.
The first time this happens it may surprise you, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
It is a mild alteration of sleep called sleep.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
There is more than one talking at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often linked to other sleep alterations such as nightmares, night terrors, nighttime bending (peeing in bed) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very high fevers, stress or over-excitement situations.
This is a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, whispers or on the contrary with screams, crying, long speeches ...
In the case where sleepiloquist becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and in order to obtain an explanation for this problem.
We have said that this is a mild alteration, which is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another sleep alteration that can be treated (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to get the child excited before going to sleep.
Therefore look for quiet games and avoid programs or television series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the sleepic appears try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he talks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if it is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not usual), do not have the temptation to question him to get information.
You will get nothing, because by sleeping, he is not conscious to be able to organize his thought.
In addition, you will hear what he is saying, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so be careful how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can question him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing very bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern has finally found his way back to victory on his field after a long period of scarcity.
Without making a big game, the Yellows and Blacks created the most opportunities and managed to transform one for the win of the game.
The pace was not very strong during this meeting where the attackers had trouble expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visiting captain Kauffmann who brushed the skylight on a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern was going to take the ascendant and in turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn above, Romain from the tip of the foot or Diebold came to tickle the defense of Dannemarie.
In front, we were block in the middle of the field and we were just leaving the moving Riahi at the forefront of the attack.
The start of the second half was going to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousiens by Marais, well positioned to resume a ball pushed back on a first attempt by Diebold (53rd').
But the Illhousian scorer will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose big problems to an Eleven Illhusian who just backed down a little to "compact" his defense, except in the very last seconds of play where, after a big scramble, the ball passed very close to the transverse.
Sarkozy meeting with angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
Faced with the show of strength of fishermen who severely disrupted the accesses of several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in Finistère, to meet their representatives.
The latter have promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he "will come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general assembly of the "cisle committee" created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures in the face of the surge in the prices of diesel, which has reached a record high of more than 1.14 euros per liter on average.
According to the spokesman of the Elysée David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by firm feet by fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing traffic jams of nearly 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île not stopped.
A filter dam has been put into place on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning, from dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic facade and the English Channel, such as the Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where the trawlers remained at the quay, or in Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the movements of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important Total refinery of Donges.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide Tuesday on the follow-up to be given to the movement and its participation in the interview scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give up" and "do not wish to move to Paris", for example, announced Liliane Cariou, the president of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but they estimate that the break-even point of a boat is only reached with a diesel fuel of less than 0.30 euro per litre.
Paul Newman the beautiful
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died of cancer, at the age of 83, in his Connecticut home.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes praised film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that hang over the global economy.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecast for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, reaffirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes a lot about the Chinese market especially for its aircraft of the range from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider divesting more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have bailed out, plans to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the 85 billion dollars that have been advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and retirement activity in the United States, says the newspaper, which quotes sources close to the file.
AIG’s board of directors met in the evening on Sunday to consider possible assignments, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
Assets that AIG plans to separate include its international leasing subsidiary Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, and its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the FT adds.
No final decision has been made on these assignments, continues the FT.
AIG must quickly realize liquidity to repay the 85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of U.S. authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting due proportion to the current shareholders.
Analysis Paris History of the session Morning Meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange blamed a historic fall on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the banks’ bailout plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dived 777.68 points to 1.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the largest fall in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technology-dominated Nasdaq index dropped 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% index (or 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 points, according to final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street has sunk after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the bank bailout plan that was to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes to and 205 in favour, the representatives refused Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he asked for.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected their plan.
“This is a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to pass a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“This shows how much the market is counting on this plan,” she added, fearing that a multi-day project would come “too late.”
“If the project is indeed dying ... then the relay will be passed quickly to the Fed and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions,” Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight, warned.
And accentuating more the feeling of urgency, "each day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" to the United States, stressed Ms. Piegza.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the acquisition of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, pushing for emergency interventions for the benefit of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing "not only a U.S. crisis, but a global crisis," the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 3.632%, from 3.827% on Friday night, and the 30-year yield to 4.161%, from 4.357% the day before.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s leading bank, which will pay nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a new one welcomed by a sharp decline in its stock price.
A week after unveiling a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of the Morgan Stanley common shares at a unit price of US$25.25, a total amount of three billion dollars.
The price selected is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible securities that ensure a return of 10% and with a conversion price of US$31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of US$29, which is 28% above its current price.
However, Morgan Stanley lost 6.79% to 23.07 dollars around 5 p.m. GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to banking holding status,” said John Mack, chief executive of the group.
Morgan Stanley passed the new statute last week, which should allow it to diversify its activities but put it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street’s biggest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday further show that the deal has been amended in recent days: on Monday, Morgan had simply announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japanese for about 8.5 billion dollars.
"A week ago," Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, told Tokyo, "we thought the stake would be made up of common shares in full.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimise the risks and hedge ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley 7% securities below their book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into common shares in a year if they exchange more than 50% above the conversion price, at about US$47, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group, however, declined to elaborate on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to have a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it has "clearly" eased its balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, which has seen its stock price come halves while the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt soared.
This cost was falling on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of the major investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised 15 billion dollars, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Refounding the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, it is the third that put to voice a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of the vote.
According to these results, the "no" got 28%, 7% of the vote was zero and 0.7% were blank votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the vote plus one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the exit of the polling stations and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a large victory of the "yes", ranking it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed in the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly", he assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians at the headquarters of the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place calmly according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), focused on a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft Constitution enshrines the power of the state over the economy, reserving to it the "planning of development" of a country living mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the currencies that its emigrants send.
Supported by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the Head of State, who will be able to serve up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that it will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
Obama, winner at the points of the first televised duel
At Friday’s first debate between the two candidates for the White House succeeded another to find out who, by John McCain or Barack Obama, won.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters have proclaimed their own victory in this television duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, while honorable, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop his drop in the polls to five weeks of the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll released on Saturday grants a five-point lead to Obama (49% vs. 44% against McCain), says it was the Democrat who pulled his weight.
Among undecided voters, who matter, Obama emerged victorious for 39% of respondents, while 25% of them gave McCain victory, according to a CBS poll.
Obama is expected to be able to confirm his lead Thursday with the good performance expected of his running mate, Joseph Biden, in the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She has good instincts,” Clinton said this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain has repeatedly highlighted his indisputable foreign policy experience, while stressing the "naivety" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." he accused several times.
“I don’t believe that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president,” he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without dismantling, he was concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain still hasn’t understood, while Obama, yes,” a Democratic spot said, referring to the Republican for not taking full account of the impact of the crisis on the “American on the street.”
“During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said yesterday in front of 20 000 people assembled for an election rally in North Carolina in heavy rain.
He didn't even utter the words "middle class" or "workers." The financial rout clearly benefits Obama, who is considered by the Americans to be the most able to save the economy on the brink of precipice.
“The coming week could be a turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration officer, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle “is the eight-year final verdict of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming that it would still be able to reduce taxes by 95% of Americans despite the upheavals of Wall Street, the senator from Illinois also reported that achieving a possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain wanted to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Careful, the two candidates have dodged questions about the 700 billion dollar (470 billion euros) financial bailout adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "you noticed that there was an election, did you?"
Young people and opponents were demonstrating Sunday night in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislative elections.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evening as soon as the polling stations closed in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some admit that they have not even voted: "What good is it, since they will do what they want with my voice," says a young person.
They do not believe that the regime that has done a good look to foreign observers in order to resume language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We have been kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the recount," said Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former 2006 presidential opposition candidate and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the voices, and in our country, it is the executive power.
If members of the opposition enter parliament, it is because they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and proposals for laws.
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "we must start the dialogue with the European Union.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, enters into crisis, and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, will recognize the validity of the vote.
She points out that the turnout figures seem too high, and that the generalization of advance voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the voice to all manipulations.
"Have you noticed that there was an election, you?" said Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition deputies in parliament, those who best suit power.”
The silence of the night falls on the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back this Monday afternoon safe and sound in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in good shape, the hostages arrived around 3:30 p.m. on a special plane at the military base in al-Maza, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, aboard helicopters to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examinations.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 on a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been tossed from one cache to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptous, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, carried on board two helicopters, launched the assault overnight just before dawn.
"An exchange of fire occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others running away," said the official, who requested anonymity.
He said that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit had in total been sent to Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned from Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
“We must recognize that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and efficiency of our secret service men, special forces,” he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol a 4x4 vehicle on which the kidnappers were, killing in six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army claimed that they were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan-Unit Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement had immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture is making headlines and occupies this election campaign.
Good. Good.
But a sector of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will rise to denounce the sums of misery that are given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that are starving?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it is neglecting its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros on the restoration of the only Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Among our American neighbors, it is written in their country’s Constitution that heritage protection is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and that, in consultation.
In Quebec, at the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40 000 volunteers grouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with excavating history, preserving with three under private archival heaps and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision-makers launch their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When is a forum for history and heritage?
The interview - Blood returned to safety
Héma-Québec was celebrating yesterday the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he regained the public confidence that had been seriously shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980’s and 1990’s.
As is well known, the national blood supplies managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service have been contaminated with the acquired immunodeficiency virus (AIS) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980's.
In the face of this tragedy and public growl, the Government of Canada instituted a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, an investigation that focused on the circumstances leading to such a tragedy and making recommendations to ensure that such a disaster does not happen again.
While Justice Krever was slow to table his report, some provinces then established a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélinau committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Services to supply all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec," recalls Dr. Decary.
The situation was disheartening.
Through efforts to improve the safety of blood products and fieldwork in the years that followed, we regained public confidence," she said, adding proudly that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that "trust is something extremely fragile."
Since its creation, on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, there were many cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says the one that has held the fort since its foundation in 1998.
"And we didn't know at all if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
We then relied on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, according to which when we do not know and that a serious disease can result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
In April 1999, blood was therefore denied for people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
However, a few years ago, it was proven beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by the blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense."
In 1999 appeared on the market a much more sensitive technique of HIV testing: nucleic acid tests (NATs) that make it possible to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus itself and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until then were based.
The NATs have shortened the dumb period, which extends between the time the person was infected and the time the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period was reduced to a period of less than one week.
This has significantly reduced the risk that some donors will be infected without knowing it and that they will not be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people runs the risk of receiving blood contaminated with HIV.
“In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV through a blood product occurs.
I believe that today we can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health, "says the CEO of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
Just last year appeared on the island of Reunion the Chikungunya virus which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant, "continues Dr. Décary before pointing out that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for an adequate supply.
"Needs are increasing because the population is aging.
Since cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a refill in red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors, which includes on average only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation.
Any healthy person, aged 18 and over who meets the eligibility criteria, can donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a malaria-affected country, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With this 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But we must renew the members of this network of donors as they age and can no longer give blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to give blood, but especially to hold them back and encourage them to become a regular donor.
The life of today being so frantic, we rarely find the time to spend an hour giving of his blood, "sorry Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for burn victims.
These fabrics are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is full of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we plan to take more than a thousand per year.
We should start offering some for transplants early next year, "says Dr. Decary who describes this program of cord blood sampling as very popular.
"Several mothers are disappointed that they cannot access it", because Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in the semi-finals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the USL First Division playoffs, with a 3-1 win (4-3 overall goals) over the Seattle Sounders yesterday in the second and decisive quarter-finals game in total goals at Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of play.
After a first half without a goal on either side, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other nets of the Montreal team.
Roger Levesque was the only one to thwart Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that in the first game of the round-trip series, Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will compete against the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder made up a 3-1 deficit in the return game to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still advanced to the semi-final round 5-4 in total goals.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In Brief - Kovalev's Victorious Goal
The number one trio of the Canadian is ready to start the season.
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the attack in a 3-2 win by the Canadian on the barrage against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the game, scored a goal, Plekanec had two assists, and Kovalev had a pass in that win, the fourth in the Habs in six preseason games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
"He tried to do too much in the first half," said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He had a great ovation.”
Charest bet on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out triggering elections until the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec City, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected on the occasion of today's by-election.
"Pushing the boundaries of our last major northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in broad outline, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a kind of Image Mill.
Turned in a loop, on three huge screens, spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great resources as during the election period.
In a press briefing, moreover, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would call the election this fall, even though he pointed out that his schedule was very busy.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory in the 49th parallel - had never been presented.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel with immense potential", but did not give a deadline, amounts of investment, or a precise priority in future projects.
At most a few avenues of what could be further developed: including hydropower, the forest, but especially the mining sector, boosted by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to the enumeration of M. Charest.
This "territory twice as big as France", "it's home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it home, but it’s in us,” he insisted, as if to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
“It’s ours, it’s our future,” he added, after taking a theatrical break to see the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said at the press briefing.
"This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and, when the opportunity arises, I reiterate this position on behalf of the government," he said.
Moreover, "with climate change, we must rethink our vision of the North," he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will open all year round because of the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the people of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former PQ MP of Ungava), have already begun consultations with about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "we will give ourselves a common vision".
The development of the North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Plan Nord will be "concerted, orderly and respectful of the environment," he said.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of the Liberal prime minister who preceded it.
"Like the Liberals who came before us, we thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a big cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central to the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who made the Revolution quiet and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa who made James Bay, our party was able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
In a press briefing, he invoked another reference, conservative this one, the program "Roads to the North" of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
By approaching the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, M. Charest noted that its commissioning was scheduled for 2012.
“It stays between us there, but I plan to be there,” he told his activists, arousing applause at home.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering a vote this fall, which the law allows him.
He points out that his schedule is, however, fulfilled, in particular by a mission of the council of the federation in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend’s General Council provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including “constitutional aspirations” that have passed like a letter to the post: the PLQ calls in particular for recognition of the “specificity of Quebec” in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and that they would have veto power over decisions made in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the outlines of the Plan Nord were welcomed with scepticism.
The PQ leader, Pauline Marois, emerged from the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, coming to power in 2003, gave up implementing it.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today" commented Ms. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (scrutin who is taking place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ supported the government's adoption of a Northern Plan.
"But what we want is for it not to be just a show," commented the leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - A disgraced country
It's M. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (O irony) in the Harper cabinet, which allowed herself last summer to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "shame" for Canada.
To bring shame on this woman who has fought a tireless fight for justice and who deserves our admiration says as much about the Prime Minister's entourage as it does about Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated its national locked in the concentration camp of Guantánamo.
A government that ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the charges against him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and leaves a child-soldier languishing in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Recall, for the record, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among other things, are calling for the repatriation of Omar Khadr to receive a fair trial in Canada.
It is this same government that turns a blind eye to torture: it does not matter that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of abuse.
We do not yet realize it, but we are witnessing at the moment an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", this word that Harper never ceases to brandish and that sounds so hollow in his mouth.
Now is the time when no morals exist anymore: you can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the goodwill of a previously minority head of government (what will happen after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates Virtue, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, M. Toews, she's here, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian speech
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Senior Vice President of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Continuing an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold company has filed a six-million-dollar defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small, penny-free publishing house in an effort to launch a "transparent public debate."
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of defamation proceedings, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by M. Garver.
For, for Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to lead to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and editor of the Black Book Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the miner.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that will gag the opposition in addition to scaring anyone who dares to look into the matter again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in public opinion that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Unlike in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are normally done through the exchange of ideas and not with batons.
It was therefore enough for the miner to open her books, her files and to establish a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support for the authors of Black Canada.
Maybe Mr. Could Garver explain how he can both ask for a "public" debate while despising the opinions of the same audience?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word refers only to highly paid lawyers and not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even critics have the right to speak.
What does not understand - or does not want to understand - Barrick Gold is that the public who support the authors and publishers of Black Canada does it above all because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This public is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a gag suit (continuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a formal notice to the authors of Black Canada telling them to stop the use of this term...).
Beyond Mr.'s surreal speech Garver, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on academic research freedom and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, en bloc, the right to the quotation of credible sources and the debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that displease the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under penalty of repeated prosecution, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right of reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate pursuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the academic world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms that limit such abusive prosecutions.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Get Along
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally came to an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic bailout since the Great Depression of the 30’s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has been rocking Wall Street for months has yet to be endorsed by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right of review on the salaries paid to the managers of the companies rescued.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative at the negotiating table Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news minutes after midnight yesterday after a two-day marathon of negotiations.
“We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets,” said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
“Everything has been done in such a way as to protect the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“That’s the fundamental point: If we don’t do that, the trauma, the chaos and the disruption to the daily lives of Americans will be immense,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned into a sprint in the last hours for fear of the effect that a new failure would have on the mood of investors.
The time limit that had been granted was the opening of the markets this morning.
Late associated with the negotiations, the two candidates in the U.S. presidential election were rather in favour of the agreement, without failing, however, to express their discontent that one is obliged to reach this extreme.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has agreed to the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including the one to allow owners to keep their homes and the salary of the executives of companies rescued by the state.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to welcome.
But these measures are necessary,” he said on American television.
Asked on another channel to find out if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The outlines I have read [show] that this is something that we will all have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to buy back with taxpayers’ money the bad, risk-asset and unsaleable debts of U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgages (subprime) before spreading to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and leading to a freeze on liquidity and the disbanding of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican elected officials who had collapsed the first draft of agreement last week.
It is believed that this impasse has been overcome since the Democrats have accepted that some "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than bought.
In order to round the corners for everyone in Congress, it was also added a provision stating that if the government were to assume losses for five years with this program, it could introduce new taxes to help it recover its stake.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of 250 billion to which will be added another 100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion is expected to be approved by another Congressional vote.
In exchange for its help, Washington will obtain stakes in rescued companies that will earn it dividends in the event of profit and that it can resell when the turmoil is over.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay seizure procedures for housing attached to the mortgages covered by this plan, as well as to set limits on compensation and severance pay paid to the executives of affected businesses.
The architects of the plan would like to see him submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives today, and to the Senate vote on Wednesday.
Despite their best efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Indeed, voices continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camps.
“Obviously, Washington doesn’t hear you,” Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told its constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists in taking advantage of taxpayers.”
Host of a small group in Congress nicknamed "the caucus of skeptics", Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred prominent professors of economics, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us to tell us: Congress is being asked not to rush and to carefully examine the path to be taken,” he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (US$16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was giving up acquiring its competitor in full shipwreck since it lost 2 billion euros (US$2.9 billion) in the crisis of risky mortgages in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, we get a right to vote in the bank and influence.
This is precisely something that savers and households now appreciate that times are looking uncertain.”
Meanwhile, across the Channel, the British government seemed to be nationalizing another bank plagued by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all loans in progress at the Bradford and Bringley bank, including more than 41 billion (75.5 billion US) of mortgages.
Spanish bank Santander said yesterday that it would buy the branches and accounts receivable of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty in the eyes of azure was for a long time his card asset, some will say his weakness.
Had he freed himself from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that flowed from the source will also have removed him from the register of power that gives birth to the real sacred monsters.
But what a great long-distance runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared Friday, at the age of 83, from lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in the pompous years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of which he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the break-up of dramatic conventions.
The mixed bloods often make beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without disproportionate ego, ultimate mark of quality.
Because in him projected himself a whole country in love with the self-made man, of the fighter of the Pacific war, wounded in battle, which in the early 50's studied drama at Yale and then frequented the Actor's Studio of New York, before triumphing in the theater, on television, soon in cinema.
The same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked second in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, coupled with a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappear with him the shadows of this secret star, discreet, committed, allergic to the bursts of show business, whose enigma will not have been quite pierced.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The disappearance of Paul Newman gave the dizziness to moviegoers this weekend, as his big roles on the black screen of memories clash.
More than half a century of a seventh ever-changing American art marche through it.
Return to shake up the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Pussy on a Burning Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newman have gone down in history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, taken after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic thug in the brilliant The Sting (The Scam), Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter pool player and avenger in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he will take the character from the return in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar on nine nominations in 1987.
That face through the ages was him.
He's still.
The eras are jostling through his journey.
The young people know him especially through the cult Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in the Coen brothers' The Hudsucker Proxy.
With a final role as Irish mafia sponsor in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the loop was closed.
Against several film legends who let go of the trade early on, Newman remained in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, his golds, his pomp and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humor, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" judging his performances too strong.
The profession has not always been tender for the handsome Paul Newman to whom the roles fell for a long time all cooked in the beak.
He played, however, less often the young first than the marginalized: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose perfect features reflected the drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed poorly known facets of his true modest sensitivity.
Her Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (after the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine feminine portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott by overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work of modesty and sadness.
Among the rain of tributes that broke yesterday on Newman, his great boyfriend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) claimed, very saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant features of the missing actor.
Beyond his legendary career, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of Hollywood drifts also disappears.
We will have seen a lot of his binette throne on pots of vinaigrette, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of rather bad taste, although gag at first.
The profits from these sales were nevertheless paid to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than sitting on his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: “Always and until the end, your father has been incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the journey of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Citizen model, in short and extra.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Company manufacture in their bill factory?
Soon, on 8 October, hearings relating to the ongoing criminal proceedings will begin against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, permanently and regularly, having resulted in particularly significant damage. Other charges were laid against them, such as for example, for false and use of forgery.
According to the prosecutor's office, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false bills.
The money of the state and municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, went on the one hand in the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other hand, in the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to receive the money from the subsidies obtained by issuing invoices of expenses, behind which no real benefit was provided and thus, the associations never respected their commitments.
According to the indictment, much of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they procured invoice books at the Józsefváros market, while they made the stamps in Kiskunhalas.
For the company names that would appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the latter's testimony, he had to spot pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model of which they made the other invoices that they would introduce, among other things, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András Őri, who according to our information was mainly concerned with drafting the files necessary to obtain the subsidies.
During a "lockdown circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place has ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place, at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up in the name of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, which will then bear the name of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, was teeming with misforms and substance.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and up to ten people could spend the night there. However, the invoice mentioned one hundred and thirty customers.
The issuers of bills with an overflowing imagination also fell into excess, when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounting, neither the name of Jobb Jövőért nor that of the Hoppá appeared, according to the information given to the prosecutor.
Győző Farkas, the company's manager, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor's office summoned him and showed him the bills, he knew, right away, that these were fake documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a wrong place on the stamp."
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that according to the bill, a hundred people have stayed there, did not stick either, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The issuers of zealous invoices also did not inquire about the travel agencies of Budapest, being part of their choice, but organizing only trips abroad. Thus, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency.
Moreover, as it appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while the services concerning travel activities, whose destination is outside the European Union, are charged without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices drawn up on behalf of the Hotel Révfülöp to the order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the company's services do not support a 25% VAT as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. In addition, the hotel employees only issue printed bills, while the fakes were handwritten.
The investigation by the public prosecutor's office reveals that the "issuers" also made mistakes in mentioning as a service the transport of goods by road, that the company issuing invoices could not exercise, since its profile was investment advice.
Moreover, it is also for defects of forms, such as inadequate types of invoices and false stamps, that the invoices issued to the order of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont have proven to be false.
Just as in the case of the company Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó sports course, which both deny being the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The forgers also did not pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have a meal at home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of the company denies having issued this invoice.
Deliberately established invoices
Another category of invoice issuers is that of those who were fully aware that they were being asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestrét Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of the grouping of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, has established an invoice to the order of the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was led to issue false invoices by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices to the order of the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the association Vörösfenyő Egyesület, for an amount of about five million
No financial move took place, either, as the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but this, the organizations did avoid mentioning it in their accounting.
The next category of invoice companies is that of companies directly related to accused persons.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the managing director of the company Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose head office was in Budapest, but where he was not found there, was Iván Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, for an amount of about 18 million HUF.
According to the investigation, this equipment was purchased by the company Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Iván Kubatov also allegedly sent documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
From what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices to the orders of Atlasz, Hoppá and de Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he pocketed their value.
It was precisely at the request of Iván Kubatov that Romanian masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies were operating, which the accused explains by the fact that they did not receive work.
He still used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-defendant as well as editor of the founding acts of the companies, he established invoices in their names, to the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as the associations Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
Kubatov has given organizations, 15 invoices in total, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The prosecutor's office thought that 10% of the sums indicated on the invoices as well as the VAT went into Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to draw up fictitious invoices that were used as part of the Biztos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért applied for a grant from the public utility organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They obtained this grant for twice 500,000 HUFs, but these amounts were not used for the objectives indicated in the application.
To prevent this from being known, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, it was these invoices that were found during the search carried out in the office of Árpád Kemecsei, at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the accused will report the method of manufacturing the invoices, as it had already done before the public prosecutor's office previously.
What could be really interesting would be that the main defendant, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil on the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or, eventually, the Socialists would have reached an agreement that in exchange for the repayment of much of the fifty million HUFs, Zusi would wear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is probably offended, since applications for his placement under house arrest, on the basis of a reduction of his conditions of detention, fall continuously in the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of non-reparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least wait at their own homes for the completion of the proceedings. He doesn't have that possibility.
The psychology of bidding: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the merchandise.
Researchers in neurology and economics at New York University have successfully updated the neurological and economic bases of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be out of date during this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that is why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
This research has attempted to draw up a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups played the lottery, while the other group took part in a playful auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) process, the researchers were analyzing the active brain domains of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction, an essential element of which is the outbidding of a third party, the whole being under the brainstem, called striatum, switched in intensively when the game was lost.
This part of the brain, alongside several other functions, plays a role in the "self-stimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
This is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the leak in the face of the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers have pursued financial monitoring analyses.
During these, three groups outbid against a partner, under various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and thus carried out their stake.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they came out of the game winner, then they would receive an additional 15 dollars, as a reward.
While the third group received these 15 dollars before the auction, but the members of the group also lost that money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the focus was on one victory, while in the other, on failure.
By proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the team of players "against failure" were willing to higher bets than those made by the control group and the group "for victory".
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena observed during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods helped remove the contradiction between the two theories by leading, now, to a third explanation." - Andrew Schotter, the professor at the New York University School of Economics, found.
Hepatitis: when should we consult a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death.
It is estimated that the disease has hepatitis virus in Hungary is estimated to be a hundred miles, but only seven miles are undergoing treatment. This is because patients often do not know that they are carriers of the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to liver infections caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but the pathogens and diseases generated differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g., contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, it is recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consuming contaminated food, usually accompanied by poor general condition, weakness, stomach upset and nausea.
Then develops on the skin and white of the eye a visible jaundice, the stools become lighter and the urine takes on a darker color. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Worldwide, every year, one million people die from the most serious form of this pathology, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that, according to estimates, only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know that they have the virus, because the pathogenic gene sneakily destroys the cells of the liver. In many cases, the first symptoms only appear after the age of 20 to 30.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Confectionation is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, 200 million patients with chronic hepatitis type C are in the world.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine examination in the laboratory, it is advisable to consult his attending physician as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, this way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of a cancer is prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing patients from around the world.
Its objective is to draw attention to the cirrhosis of the chronic liver, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states help the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European banking institution in distress following the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, partially nationalizing it. The three countries support, up to an amount of 11.2 billion euros, this financial and insurance institution also having interest in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments have agreed, at the highest level, in this case, also by appealing to the European Central Bank and the head of competition of the European Commission.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis in more than a year is for the Fortis bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy back nearly half (up to 49%) of the bank’s capital in each of the countries.
The bank will, without a doubt, sell part of its stakes, among which, in the first place, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch organization ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis actions began a dizzying fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too large for it to be allowed to go to bankruptcy.
On Friday alone, the company's shares fell 12 percent, to its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, stocks have fallen by more than two-thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around 14 billion euros, which, according to the company's managers, is not realistic.
The company's management blames uncertainty across the Atlantic, in connection with the adoption of the US 700 billion dollar bailout, of being behind the fall of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers have already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as the new CEO.
The financial institution was also looking for private purchasers, but has not yet received a proposal on the merits.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank's client circle and no agency was stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also acquired leasing companies.
Does anyone who grows in God feel less pain?
According to the results of recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of painkiller, which would have already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph published an article that researchers at the University of Oxford have conducted an interesting experiment by analyzing at what level belief in God could influence tolerance to human pain.
As part of this bizarre experience, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers have been able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a human brain palpation technique, it was also possible to discover that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiments, in which academicians, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More precisely, the experiment takes place in the following way: an instrument emitting sparks and diffusing the electroshocks is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look back at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with the ermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers behind this experiment hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary evoked a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, was about its soothing effect.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and meanwhile, received 20 electroshocks in four parts succeeding each other, while looking at either the religious-themed painting or the more general theme.
The Catholics declared that in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe" as someone who was "cared for" and they "calmed down, and peace invaded them."
At the sight of the painting of religious theme, they reported 12% less pain than when they looked at the work of Leonardo.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, thinks that one can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, in atheists, provided you find the appropriate photo.
“We should find an image that they react to very positively, such as a mother or father,” the psychologist said.
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, praised the results of this research.
“The practice of faith should change and in many cases, actually changes our personality,” Wright added.
After these excellent results, there is only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if we show the believers a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same caliber?
Would the sight of a better Virgin Mary cause better results?
You are what you disclose about you
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google says that it can be found in the bottom of people's pockets just like the sky above their heads. He knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what their interests are.
However, that is not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people in the company.
While when it comes to skeptics drawing a parallel with Orwell’s horror vision, they don’t see the bulk of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary for the founders of Google to be able to respect their initial goal which sounded as follows: "Let's collect in a system all the information of the world!".
According to the Google executive interviewed, after ten years of global upheaval, they are still only at the beginning of their goals to be able to process all the information.
To the question: what will be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like “What could I do tomorrow?” or “What work would suit me best?” However, software will only be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first glance, on the day when they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used during searches on the Internet, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages then consulted by the interested persons are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can view what they searched for, what they clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will submit products and services to us on the basis of our previous statements and our recorded preferences.
What if someone uses my data against me, if they look at my job? ask users, who worry about Google's monopoly of information.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can arouse fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or possibly revolt against power that can arouse in Internet users a counter-reaction.
It is, however, a confirmed fact that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justified cases, they are transmitted to a third party, and in this kind of legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most resounding example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, allowing an identification.
Human rights-conscious Internet users were able to breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, arming its way up with the electronic legal protection agency EFF, proved its right in court over the FBI. According to the ruling, in the future, Google will still not be required by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information about the FBI’s secret request of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won compared to the strengthening of the law on child protection, voted several years earlier. But ultimately, it fails to obtain the search lists of private users, nor the entire list of websites and keywords of the last two months.)
The judgment of Google is therefore quite contradictory: it is criticized by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that is manifested against multinational corporations proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its “savages” bringing together enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic computer users who appear in many countries see Google as the next generation of big companies, the “plugged-in corporation,” as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, cataloged as the world’s invader because of Windows, even if both fight for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The document code and the package of programs, continuously refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, in the face of the practice of the official software giant.
The reason can also be that geeks see very exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what Web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword of recent years, is precisely behind it.
Indeed, web 2.0 is nothing other than collaboration, that the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind, and that we use the communication channels made available to us, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can hold a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link these to other performances, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then it can link these to a tracking system, like FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also keep blogs, in which automatically appear their newest photo galleries that they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can take note of many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands in the sight of the morning photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the company that fired one of its employees, just for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about top management, we can be on one thing: the term of privacy is totally
The one who lives an online life is made up of what he shows of himself, and this is how we can define the principle behind the behavior of today's young people.
The one wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to bypass Google’s monopoly, can do it (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but, at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not the least. Google online’s services, through word processing, image processing, information reading can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to huge server fleets and do not assemble our best profile, having existed to this day.
Public opinion is waiting, without really hiding from it, the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of 156 billion dollars, is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (US$124 billion) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars). AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while services introduced at an increasingly important speed cause serious migraines not only to Microsoft, but to many other computer program creators.
However, critical observers find, alongside all this, contradictions having worrying effects: for example, the top management of the company has refused, in its entirety, the protests of the employees, after it has doubled the price of the corporate kindergarten and after the company has deemed the daily multiple restoration too expensive, taken at any time. All this seems ridiculous alongside the fact that already in 2006, Google has agreed before the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that hurt good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company's internal rules, new services are not advertised only when they can be used. What is certain is that in the next few months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some believe that Google’s book and magazine scanning and archiving project is taking on such important dimensions that society will soon find itself facing the U.S. Supreme Court, others are trembling at its Health system, because in this one, we can build a complete medical profit from our previous analysis results, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google is mounting a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel by the famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian half-tones, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a staggering way just through Google data.
Two minors helped remove the traces of Ózd's double homicide
"The police have summoned two minors to question them in the case of the double homicide of Ózd. According to well-founded suspicions, they helped remove traces of the crime." - said the spokesman of the Borsod department.
The young people acknowledged the facts that are being blamed on them. For now, they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency) are young girls, defend themselves free.
The complicity in murder can lead to detention of up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double homicide of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was remanded in custody on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicide, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and it is for this reason that he attracted his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in Ózd where he killed him, as well as the little girl of this man, 9 years old.
According to information from the MTI, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the scene of the crime is proof of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Makes Proposal for Acquisition of Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech krona, for the redemption of 100% of the share package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the proposal that the Polish made despite the fact that, previously, the Czechs excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The cause of this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wishes to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activities.
According to the Czech economic daily newspaper E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest bid that has been made so far for the acquisition of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those concerned, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner, and did not rule out the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague stock exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated to be between 5 to 10 billion Czech kroner by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent stakes, followed by the 14.7 percent of the Ceská Sporitelna Bank and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their Tuesday comments on the international financial crisis, worsening day by day, the leading European press newspapers are already talking about a "second 11 September".
"The overall financial catastrophe, we owe it to the American president" - accuses the daily of Rome, La Repubblica. "The president has not even been able to make a bloc with his own party behind a bill, improvised in haste, aimed at helping a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as mentioned by billionaire Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about a second 9/11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the shortcomings of the political leadership there that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing every day, and subsequently the whole world will pay the high price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, according to the congressional vote, a real threat danger, that which Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in a vacuum, just when in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
The threat cannot be ignored any longer - emphasizes the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some statements can still stretch a lifeline to their staggering financial organizations, and thanks to their taxpayers' money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, we need the states of the European Union to face little of their national selfishness, and to centralize control over divided financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - recalled the Viennese daily, Der Standard, which adds that fears that European taxpayers too will have to put their hands in the pocket, very deep, similar to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, is going through the old continent from side to side.
The "rescuers" should not immediately raise one hundred billion euros, on the other hand it would be wise if they noted in which case it would be rational to receive taxpayers' money, with the objective of preventing greater damage.
Smart cars mimic the theft of the drone
What method would be better for developing technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, if not the imitation of an obstacle detector already existing in nature?
Like, for example, the bee.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC, taking place in Japan, buzzing bees gave Nissan’s strategic initial idea to engineers to inspire them on how they need to design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired self-roboticized control system, of the BR23C type, which it has equipped with the qualities of bees, the ultimate objective being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its thefts, each bee is its own space, oval in shape, which in reality, is very similar to our secure protective hull - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development and technological public relations department of the brand.
The bee's faceted eye plays a primary role, since it is able to see in all directions, in an angle of 300 degrees.
To mimic the functions of the faceted eye, the engineers addressed the idea of the laser rangefinder.
The latter identifies obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, it evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which transforms it into an avoidance maneuver immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini robot auto, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it by a sufficient angle to avoid collision.
Unlike any existing system at present, this avoidance maneuver takes place entirely instinctively.
“If it weren’t so, the mini robot car wouldn’t be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for the moment the collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process should reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in the blink of an eye.
In contrast to bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, in place of the infinite combinations that bees have to avoid other bees, in our case, we could only use the rotary movement, the acceleration and the slowing down as maneuvers at the disposal of the mini robot auto
The BR23C uses Lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and with a larger energy concentrate, making their lifespan longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is paramount, not data processing, let alone the ability to store.
This mechanism should process only a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with the intuitive logic based on the data of previous maneuvers. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
We do not need memory of a capacity of gigabytes, or even of megabytes.
This is the first step towards the design of a technology used for instant avoidance. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will make its entry into mass-produced cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding the obstacles in his path.
We even gave the baby a name overpriced
The written version of the 700 billion dollar economic rescue plan, aimed at buying back the bad loans of the banks, and using in several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of that money will be spent.
Reuters announces that during new debates extending until after midnight, on Saturday, local time on the east coast, congressional leaders have agreed on the controversies that have existed for days and days, around the bailout of a total amount of 700 billion dollars.
“We have taken a serious step forward” — said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, that all that remains is to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in commenting on the outcome of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, however other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question here of the rescue of Wall Street, but of turning the workings of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets, Sunday evening at 8pm, Washington local time (i.e. Monday at 2am, according to local time in Central Europe), but did not cause a spectacular rise in the stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill in the name of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Then his fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
“We are pleased with the advances reached tonight, and we strongly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,” said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
On the other hand, the program differs from the Bush administration's initial proposal, which it mentioned that the 700 billion dollars had to be spent in one go, for the redemption of securities relating to questionable credits.
From now on, a maximum of half the sum of 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after Congress passed the law, probably on Monday. This first amount will be used by the Treasury Secretary to purchase bad debts from banks, while the use of the additional 100 billion dollars will be left to the discretion of the President.
The program will be overseen by an independent agency, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The expenditure of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to put in place a combined strategy: it can, at the same time, buy bad debts, debts relating to mortgages and doubtful mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" debts.
The competent persons of the department stated that the buybacks may take place in connection with an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to take part in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools that cause concerns, for which companies will have paid a premium equivalent to foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson said the law provides the necessary tools to spend 700 billion dollars for the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the vast redemption of bad debts, their insurance, or avoiding the risk of the system causing the collapse of one or the other major financial institution.
"We will make the necessary arrangements, to be ready for law enforcement, as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, the leaders of the banks in poor positions and waiting for state help can expect that their severance pay, simply called a golden parachute across the Atlantic, will be capped by the government.
The ceiling on wages is only mentioned in very specific cases. In addition, the limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat offers its assistance to the company.
The cap principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat redeems in an auction, they will levy a surplus of tax on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Directly after the redemption of the bad debts, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the officers is not exaggerated.
For the image to be complete, it must still be added that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The ceiling concerns only the new contracts, this in order to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in U.S. history that legal caps will be in place regarding the appointments of the general managers - commented the chairman of the committee in charge of financial benefits of the House of Deputies, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State acquires a right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan. In this way, the risk of taxpayers decreases, since they can even be a winner in the case as soon as the economy and with it the saved banks will fall back on their feet.
The bill mentions that in the next five years, the President must introduce to Congress a proposal that will rule on how the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That’s not why U.S. citizens have mandated us, this doesn’t protect taxpayer dollars — California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa said.
Her Ohio Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, thinks it’s the same people who are pressing for action, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial selling prices increased by 0.1 percent compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007 - the Hungarian Central Statistical Office said.
Industrial export selling prices rose 1.1 percent from July 2008, while compared to a year earlier, they fell by 3.9 percent.
As a result of fluctuations in domestic and export prices, industrial producer prices increased by 0.7 per cent compared to the previous month, and by 3.2 per cent compared to previous year.
Domestic industrial selling prices rose only to a lesser extent: by 0.1 percent, compared to the previous month.
Domestic selling prices in the processing industry sectors increased only to 0.1 per cent from July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was observed in the manufacturing sector of leather and footwear (2.8 percent), with in the first place, the manufacture of bags and belts with a monthly increase of 4.6 percent, then the production of shoes with 2.5 percent of monthly increase.
The level of higher prices for plastic and chemical raw materials has resulted in a significant monthly increase in prices in the manufacturing sector of products and chemicals (1.6 per cent).
Deflation resulted in the oil processing (1.4 per cent), manufacturing of electrical machinery and appliances (0.9 percent), and a minimal increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 percent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
Other sectors of the processing industry increased, ranging from 0.2 percent to 0.9 percent.
In the sectors of the supply of electricity, gas, steam and water, representing a significant weight in domestic industrial exploitation, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly because of the effect of the increase in the price of gas set up by the authorities since 1 July.
In a twelve-month comparison, taking into account the domestic sale of the processing sectors, it was the prices of the oil processing sector that saw the most significant increase (32.4 percent).
In the manufacturing sector of metallurgical products, there was a price increase of 13.2 per cent, while in the important area of food, beverage and tobacco production, prices increased by 11 percent.
Price decreases have occurred in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the processing industry, price increases have changed between 0.6 percent and 9.1 percent.
In the processing industry as a whole, prices increased by 10.2 percent over the past year.
Prices for the electricity supply, gas, steam and water sectors exceeded the previous year's electricity, gas, steam and water by 18.7 percent.
Among the internal trade groups and according to the allocation of sectors, in August, it was the profit-on-investment sectors that showed the most significant monthly price increase (0.7 per cent).
In consumer goods production sectors, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, while those in the energy and materials-producing sectors for further processing did not change from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase in the energy production and materials sectors for further processing was observed (16.8 per cent).
In consumer goods production sectors, inflation was measured by 6.8 per cent, while for profit-initiating sectors, a decrease of 1.4 per cent.
Export selling prices in the industrial sector, in HUF, rose 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, while they experienced a decline of 3.9 percent over 12 months.
In one month, our national means of payment weakened by 1.7 percent against the euro, and by 7.1 percent against the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it strengthened by 7.5 percent against the euro and 15.9 percent against the dollar.
Will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that around January 12, the US-Hungarian visa-free agreement will come into force. This is what the Minister of Foreign Affairs said in Chicago, in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "now everything depends only on when electronic entry and control systems across the Atlantic will be put into operation."
All the more so, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The Hungarian foreign minister will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will hand over the decoration of the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank bailout
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, assured their support of the government’s bailout of 700 billion dollars. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Treasury Secretary.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, the congressional representatives and the Administration finally announced, Sunday at dawn, that they have concluded agreements in principle on the bailout plan of the banks.
This financing plan, aimed at thawing the Wall Street crisis and the paralysed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as more capable than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the highlighting of economic issues, Obama has again managed to get a little ahead. McCain’s advance, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a running mate just after the Republican convention, has melted.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly pass the 700 billion bailout law.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages that he too supports.
“It is now that we must act, with responsibility ... a danger threatens your work, your economies, entire industrial sectors and the stability of the entire economy,” he told a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to qualify McCain's economic ideas as outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “We will all have a hard time swallowing it ... but doing nothing is not a possible way.”
The Republican senator said that in the proposal, mention is made of the creation of a Treasury Control Commission and the cap on severance pay from senior leaders, and that it was, personally, very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
The press review of the German language territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - this is how the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country, evokes.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of the reds and blacks.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The Revolution in Bavaria devours his fathers".
According to this well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now it is these same modern citizens who turn their backs on them.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process came to an end that was likely just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU was picking up with 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is to say at the time of the so much-mentioned Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization "devouring his parents", established in the region in a consistent way by the CSU.
Sociologists have been announcing this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong about the pace. However, secularization, the results of education and the establishment of Germans from the north and east in the developing region of Bavaria could not remain without consequences for the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only inside the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks, it is precisely the groups of classical citizens who have rather distanced themselves from the CSU, such as the independents, the craftsmen, the holders of the bac and the graduates of higher studies.
In these groups, support for UHC has dropped below 40 percent.
Die Press (diepresse.com)
In his article entitled "Who? With who? The party presidents stand on the reserve in the face of the issues of the coalition," the conservative Austrian daily deals with the situation of confused domestic politics that took hold after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SPÖ want to discuss with the conservatives of the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from meddling in its internal affairs.
The populist party BZÖ is being open for negotiations. The Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
The elections took place, now everything revolves around the coalition; during the debates organized on public television, party leaders have barely hinted at their cards.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to talk with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that the cooperation of both parties is indeed possible - this is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, remains open on the part of Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the Reds’ proposals.
As he has already said, a collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
In his party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is momentarily a completely open question. These points must be discussed in the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, President of the BZÖ, is again open to all proposals.
“To avoid the coalition of the reds and blacks, we are ready to assume government responsibilities,” Haider said.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, began in Paris as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In her message to the plenary, as one of the main spokespersons of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, MEP Fidesz the European People's Party, drew attention to segregations in education, because it is a violation of the right that most affects Roma children and therefore, one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened on the one hand by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and, on the other, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Those invited to take part in the consultation include the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of the deputy Fidesz Popular Party, Járóka warned that alongside the distinctions found during hiring, the Roma disappear from the labour market, in the first place, following their low qualification.
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have high school diplomas, and as a result of poor quality elementary education, only a tiny part has the opportunity to obtain a higher education diploma."
Furthermore, Járóka stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role in the promotion of other fundamental rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children means a strengthening of the economies of the European Union's member countries.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relations in a circle as wide as possible, also between Roma and non-Roma.
Indeed, the earlier a Roma child begins school, the more he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by the taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
"By their nationality of the European Union, Roma must be assured of their right to quality education, and be protected from low-quality and sectarian education." - stressed Lívia Járóka.
According to the Member, a collaboration of the European Union oriented towards an objective and action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of degregation of schools. For this, compliance with existing and in-prepared anti-discrimination directives is of paramount importance.
"We must break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and the unemployed. The possibilities for Roma children must be given the opportunities for Roma children to participate as full citizens in the future of Europe" - Járóka demanded.
On behalf of the "European Year for Equal Opportunities" for all, the objective of the Summit for Equal Opportunities in Europe held each year since the summit in Berlin last year is to provide a single platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and to combat discrimination, targeted at European and Member country level.
A fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs which link the use of information concerning the prescription of medicinal products, in any case, to the consent of the data subject.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it amounts to entrusting his chicken coop to a fox" - recalled Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage drug prescriptions, to the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the insured capital depend in the event of damage, the state of health of the client who presents himself, and if they feel that the risk is too great, they do not even insure it.
In the past, they sent the candidates for a medical examination, and they only signed an insurance contract with them after becoming aware of the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, he easily obtains data from pharmacies, data concerning the purchase of drugs from the person in the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines for itself, what disease the person suffers from and what is their state of health.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, it refers to an extremely high fat level in the blood, which immediately puts them in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some determine at the same time a coefficient of risk, therefore, there is not much left to do to the insurer except for paperwork. However, tiny problems may still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or hot flashes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers to be an aggravating risk factor, while others do not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of data. They must request permission from the patient before collecting necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are forced by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their failures in the past.
Recently, some companies have also dealt with laboratory test results, and link them with data on drug use. In this way, they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of the health of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, and control of usage is becoming increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill on the expansion of the control circle of the authorities concerning companies specializing in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has further developed his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the data subject.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his agreement or not, since if he refuses, insurance does not sign an insurance contract with him.
Thus and ultimately, the chickens depend on the benevolence of the fox.
CSU: Grace for a period of transition
It is in October that the decision will be made on the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the summits of the Bavarian CSU has been adjourned.
The party’s president, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their place. The question is how long will grace last?
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic loss of voices of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the congress of the exceptional party, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair have, in any case, made it clear that they do not care specifically at their headquarters.
Thanks to this, they worked to appease the furious members of the fraction and the base, which one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the peak of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the coup against Stoiber, there are only 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "sole sovereign" of Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But the Conservatives still count heavily in this southern region, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal redevelopment of the party, the vice-president and the federal minister of agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as Huber's possible successor, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates groping discussions with the liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the values of the right, about a possible coalition of the Munich government.
A strange nose of fate was that with the help of the list of Free Electors, enters into the legislation the Gabriele Pauli, whose taking of action against Stroiber served as a possibility of putsch perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, and then treats without care the very ambitious municipal politician.
Now, the leaders of the CSU are putting all their energy into stabilizing, one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who until now pulled the strings behind the scenes, will also receive an active role. The former head of regional government and former president of the CSU, designated September 28 as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some sharp remarks to the CDU. According to him, they deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel can only be a chancellor again if they reset their feet in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hardly hiding his disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of ground of the CSU will not negatively influence the Berlin grand coalition.
This is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the wounded CSU, and the crisis of the socio-democrats is still going on.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals : 110 - 0
No opposition MP came to the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country headed by Alexander Lukashenko, which assures him prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by the illegalities committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislative body composed of 110 people in this country of 10 million inhabitants has been going very well in opposition for many decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition joining forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his mandate as president for the fourth time in questionable elections, in the footsteps of the modification of the constitution in 2006, "allows"
In this way, the ODSZ has given up its boycott originally planned.
The fact that Belarus, which is increasingly dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order described as anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive an entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus had to take credit because of the decrease in imports of Russian natural gas, which is always more expensive, and thus contributed to the passage of the company Beltransgaz, owner of the gas pipes crossing the country, passed into the hands of the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, in the evaluation of the campaign, focused on positive change rather than breaches, such as the ban on running for a third of opposition candidates, referred to prior appeasement.
However, Monday's OSCE statement already disputed the campaign, during which most opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present at the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: political detainees have regained their freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, always refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia. However, Russia with which Belarus forms a confederation on paper, has considered the two independent territories for a month already.
“We have taken two steps forward, and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has been initiated between Belarus and the EU” – Alexander Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remain so, despite the fact that "the power was afraid in this parliament which has no weight, to bring in even a single opponent".
The opposition does not foresee protest actions in view of the results. Instead, it is trying to send its message about the need for economic reforms among voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of worries on this side: we have to have our opponents' newspapers printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting sticks in our wheels for the broadcast, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly" - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that in the current regime of Lukashenko, which considers the social security more and more
"Because of the country's debt and the rise in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery', is only a matter of time," Milinkevich said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds." In this way, the absence of the opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
The overall menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are doubled in their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside the other, largely global issues.
Today, a France-India summit will also be held, which will focus on cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is a great emerging democratic power to whom a broader right of speech should be given in international affairs, but member countries have not yet managed to agree on their support for their support in New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
Moreover, they did not dwell too much on this issue, yesterday, at this 9th summit organized in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, like the current President of the Union, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Foreign Minister Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years, they would double the number of trade, which means an increase of a hundred billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, the trade in goods has increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an overly ambitious target.
In this sense, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral conventions with India concerning civilian flights. In this way, air trade will also be able to take off in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up negotiations.
The objective is to balance the situation with India, which is the EU's largest trading partner, and on the other hand, New Delhi, which is only ninth among EU partners.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The Afghan and Pakistani situation had been strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a United Nations conference on the subject was raised.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle was also called for, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains faithful to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would like to reduce its toxics by at least 20 per cent until 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as the fact that a global market should be made at next year's climate conference, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by fifty percent until 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and supported convening an international working meeting to address the financial crisis.
The Indian head of state is visiting the French capital today, where during a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders for a value of twenty billion euros for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the news agency's information, the agreement would be 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is waiting for this edition, more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 various countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Salon with more than 403 thousand titles in exhibition, and Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Butterfly: indeed, Italy will be present in an institutional way, with a Point Italy- 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by the appointment with the press in the Room Struktur, at the butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospectives on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author's books gradually decreases in relation to the total Italian production, and in particular, compared to that for adults and children.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work."
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, did not have revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from today, this new measure against the smart children, against who points and then goes to drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-lazy novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors - says Brunetta- are an instrument to better work, with more productivity, more presence and more services," says the minister.
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
"This is reformism," Brunetta said.
The installation in all the establishments of the Presidency of the Council is completed with the Palais Chigi.
According to Masi, "the choice of rotating doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of the employees has been registered, assures the secretary general: "it is a process shared by the employees, and we have had the collaboration of all."
In short, more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissant.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests with a smile, "a good cappuccino at 7am is a great and healthy resolution."
At a conference at the Ecole Supérieure de l'Administration publique
from Rome, the minister communicates that "in three months, the absences of sickness of public employees have been reduced by 50%, or 60 miles more workers in a year".
And he added that it was essential to make the Public Administration more efficient.
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - over the last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and in addition to inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees have joined forces to challenge the standards of the Brunetta decree using the Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service today spreads the data concerning the decline of absenteeism in the workplace because of illness - writes the association of consumers - the people of the "active lazy" continue to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive public administration employees met to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In particular, in Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in the event of infirmity because of service is contested; the extension of the schedules of the housing permanence schedules of the sick worker, during which the inspection visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Accidents at the workplace, Napolitano: "Crucial prevention"
Every day in Italy, there are 2,500 work-related accidents, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, the Inail data confirm that the white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To have the attention of institutions, social forces and means of information on this dramatic aspect, Anmil celebrates today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents on Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data disseminated by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the subject of prevention in the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, during a message sent to the president of Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Invalid Workplaces, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "sincere appreciation for the continuing associative effort in favor of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of victims and the awareness of public opinion"
"naturally indignant, everyone has punched to put an end to such tragedies which, by their size, arouse the clamour of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if the daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamic.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not to underlie the alarm about social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the Speaker of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed how "this phenomenon of white deaths is an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and imposes on all institutions, to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly."
The data of the workers on the work seem to signal a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths is still impressive," said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
"we do not want this "trend at a discount" to be translated in fact, into a minor attention, because it is precisely when attention relaxes, that tragedy happens.
"we believe that in general, we do not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be achieved through multiple actions."
"In our opinion- stressed Mercandelli- more controls and inspections are needed, as is a greater intervention on the training of workers, and this, from school."
- He added - "that an effort must be made again with regard to communication and public awareness.
"But above all, it is necessary to have a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Mercandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration of the conditions of safeguarding the compensation provided for the victims of work" and the "derive of assistance to which the system is moving in recent years".
"The objective, therefore, is to give back to the worker the guarantee of insurance - he added - so that the fate of the one who has an accident, must not depend on the spontaneism or the enlargement of the legislator"
Mp3 player pointed, they put at risk the hearing.
Listening to music at full volume for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players, can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission, which, in a statement broadcast in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the unforeseen and recently identified health risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific report - let's read in the note - it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full-volume music using portable music devices, for more than an hour a day and a week, risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at full volume, can unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably,” Kuneva said.
"According to the scientific data - continues the Ue- it is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What matters most is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems, given the scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical equipment and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
"Scientists-concluded the Ue- Executive confirm that there are good reasons to be concerned, and that the European Commission will now discuss with Member States and other interested parties what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents, against exposure to noise from wearable music devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but concern is increasing about hearing damage that could derive from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
These data can be clearly limited using solutions such as reducing noise levels and exposure time.
The Scientific Committee Eu points out that users of portable music devices, who listen to full-volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours a week, exceed the current limits on the maximum noise level granted at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for extended periods of time, risk permanent loss of hearing ability after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified at around 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno has given the order to send the Commission out for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we end, in June we will pull the sums.
This is the calendar set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the Commission's 49 other components will finalise the guidelines for Rome.
In March when they are finished, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, so as to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented - would like to underline Alemanno- it will have to propose ideas for development of Rome that can be used by political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Municipal Council.
No superposition of roles, but only the will to have a corner where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, she will have finished her tasks and then disappear, because this experience must have a precise time duration.
In June-announces the mayor - we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital. "
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its views will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as indeed in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by the management of everyday life and emergencies that manifest themselves from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to see forward, and further, towards a deeper foresight, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to emphasize that "this Commission is not a useless body or a bureaucratic whole: it is absolutely free, and will not cost the Roman city dwellers a euro, and will serve to study and involve the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "we need a strategic draft reference, neither firm nor immobile, in order to allow our city, to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking of its future now a unitary spirit, ".
A future that, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but which will look further" not only from the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who wants to pass as an independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambition.”
Obama is really panted: he believes he will earn the highest office of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!
In reality, these are attacks that do not say much; they are obviously attacks of a racial nature, and do not answer the question of all the voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, all of which state that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who talks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know well to whom the American patriot will give his vote.
Now emerges an aspect of the American mentality kept secret until the end.
“Say what you want, we’ll see ourselves putting the cross, on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed until now, so much so that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Anyway, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what mistakes did Bush make during his term? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home with kicks to the buttocks.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack their bags.
Despite this, Iraq has been, for the most part, Bush's weakness.
Who will take George W's place will have a huge task to accomplish.
Usa, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for suppressions. And many accuse the Internet, this "murder" of newspaper.
Five hundred American journalists were arrested by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mind control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists are now pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly declare to the information attachés, feeling less worried about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated as they used to.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition, deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work on the assembly of newspapers, are a big problem.
This is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as the general public understands it, is to be reduced in a significant way.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and print newspaper journalists are convinced that national journalism is following a bad path.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists have no trouble seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses make their way to the Internet, perceived by many as the "murderer" of the newspaper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel is increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to getting into technology hoping it would “do something good” for their journalism.
Today, the biggest snag in American journalism lies between who runs the newsrooms—that is, the directors—and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level, are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is related to the "safety of work".
Directors who think they are losing their jobs in the space of 3 years, are 47% nationally.
As for journalists, we go to 30%.
That of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, editors) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the USA, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Managers almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn 10 thousand dollars a month, besides retirement and insurance payment.
As for the holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, spent a certain number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often "sick" during the year.
It's the climate's fault.
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS IN GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to dismiss the body of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a home in Rome.
. Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the Unipol-Bnl escalation training.
At the trial at his expense last week, he obtained the house release converted into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent be able to travel the route of the provincial city to a dwelling in the capital.
According to the court, such travel (which the board did not grant) would allow him to influence his company and have access to the evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the 700 billion dollar bailout approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its soulful watch East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions as well as to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, powerful especially in the Central and Southern states.
The soul, precisely, who was felt despotically with the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, what has just been quoted is only an example of the changes, of the great changes that the current economic earthquake pre-announces or already lets run: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and may not only be here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena incubated for some time, so much so that, in the new climate, they solidify and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the updating, the extraordinary revival, of the double category of sovereign state, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions that have, obviously closely with the foreigner, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families who live in a single country, in a single state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is to say, as to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost only here national.
Political internationalisation seems to be really out of the game or, has little to say: the obvious proof is provided to us by the European Union, which, shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, cannot decide any common political line.
And so, it is from the government of each state that all expect interventions, bailouts and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a credit condition: when we go through a difficult period, there are only the states that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimization to use them: two resources of inestimable value, elements which no market or international organization can ever dispose of in a similar way.
This new emphasis on the state-nation crisis is moreover in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that the more recent economic developments of the economy tend to attribute to a factor quite linked to this element: territoriality.
. Paradoxically, indeed, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, ever more sophisticated technology, non-material technology, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized at once, that on the contrary our future will have to settle its scores always more with things rather unmaterial such as water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth, but which are absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly possesses more cards than he who is not, that is, he who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty which, however, provides for a fracture.
Who says Territory, state, government, inevitably says Political, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take control of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of a shadowy area.
And in addition, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even disturbing: a discredit, a suffering, a picture of inadequacy, a feeling of distance that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of countries of the West.
Thus further increases the conviction of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be ever more alien to the opinions of the majorities.
in short, the demand for leadership, feeds underground, a powerful and branched movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the improvised "revolts" electoral or, in the changes of collective moods of recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria Bavaria, at the fall of the Labours in Great Britain, in the rebellion of the American congressmen
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, their format, would say someone, always have more difficulty, which is not from today, to understand and therefore represent the deep strata of Western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and potentially stirs in a disproportionate way.
In view of all this, talking about a current "mass rebellion" on the agenda, seems frankly exaggerated.
But it is said, keeping your eyes wide open is not without reason.
The supercolla to walk on the walls.
Defeat the laws of gravity with a super glue and, in the future, walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centers, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measured just 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to keep a 100-kilogram body stuck on a vertical wall.
The American Journal Science published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti." Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that make it possible to assure the animal, a perfect adherent.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it "easily detaches from the wall" explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton School of Engineering.
WALKING ON THE WALLS? –” this material could be used as a temporary adhesive,” adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers are thinking of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since carbon nanotubes are conducting heat and electric current.
Other applications may be related to aerospace engineering.
For now, no superheroes.
The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, California researchers presented an adhesive made up of microfibers like hair, which self-cleans dust during movement on an area to ensure perfect and constant adherence.
Drugs: Never with fruit juices.
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in the summer because it is non-altering and rich in vitamins, if combined with certain vital drugs, alter the amplifying or decreasing absorption according to the case, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether in box or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launches a new alarm: it only takes a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice, to reduce the absorption of certain drugs.
Grapefruit juice has already been heavily criticized because it is responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-staminal and neurological drugs, to toxic levels.
A RISK- It was the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which had given the news in a two-year newsletter, alerting doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mix and to pay attention to what is being done, if we take drugs such as, for example, Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT JUST THE GRAPeFRU. According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the call of Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology at the Public University of Milan: "These discoveries are generally, immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will have to change the informational notes of the drugs if necessary.
It is always worth reading the illustrative papers of the drugs that we are taking, and, if something is not clear, not being impressed, but addressing clearly to the doctor or pharmacist," the expert told the Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on trade models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a well-known New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman wrote in an article published on the New York Times that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the history of the United States.
A prediction that unleashed many polemics, and was blamed on the economist for years, but which has now proved to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and even a little shocked by how quickly the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom, disappeared from public attention,” Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a very aggressive, "style-discloser" discloser, particularly critical of the excesses of the Bush administration's liberalism.
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It’s the day OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach ever and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a nearly one-year work, carried out by volunteer developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various novelties: from the welcome screen, and the revised and less austere interface, to others more important, such as compatibility born for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and the support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest version
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, some functions specific to certain modules, such as the one that reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files in the graphical development module, keeping the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format graph with the elements of a spreadsheet or text builder.
Collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements inside the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts over the changes, in the elaboration of texts, because to each employee is assigned a comment color for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some features of OpenOffice to the web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should issue the final result.
The Italian version is unloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and is in addition to the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is available as usual, for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be shipped to the home or workplace.
And if the theme of gratuitousness can be a way to disseminate it in the houses, it is precisely in the business, that Open Office tries the big challenge, can already count on various projects realized in the public administration and the schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for equivalent Word write video; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for rival PowerPoint ;Dbase presentations, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on the databases; finally Drwa is the graphic module.
Target for 2008, reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
This is the website of the daily newspaper L'Equipe that reports the news.
At 26, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist at Cera, the third-generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on the Kohl test tubes are part of those carried out in recent weeks, by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analyses confirm the positivity at the Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity at the third-generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told The Associated Press, that he had notified the Austrian authorities of positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus winning the polka dot jersey of the best climber.
IMMIGRES:NEW YORK TIMES WONDERS IF ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has recently turned into a preferred destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
Would this turn the Beautiful Country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times is about, which dedicated a long article debating the theme of racism in Italy, starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are both those where we record "more integration and more work", but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most important support for the North Lega"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislature wanted by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
Tendency underlined by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict XVI in the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism."
Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of the plane of Steve Fosset, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying on the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris was found on a plateau at an altitude of 3000 meters, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the California-Neva Nevada border.
Inside the plane, no human remains though.
Madera County's sheriff, John Anderson, ousted the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it is indeed the one on which Steve Fosset was traveling the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff said that no human remains were found either on the plane or in the vicinity.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Board (Ntsb) said that a few hours after the wreckage was found, a team of investigators sent to the scene, identified the aircraft: it is indeed the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset’s personal belongings were found by a couple around their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing the name Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
On the sixth attempt, he became in 2002, the first man to complete the round the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had traveled the world by plane and non-stop.
Among all these records, also that of having flown at 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you're not waiting for.
An unusual 4x4 of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, ample surfaces and sharp angles.
Here, in summary, Glk, the latest born of the "compact" off road of the star's house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a wind of novelty in this sector.
Precisely because of its non-standard, unexpected and unconventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, from October 17.
Thus the hype that will accompany the beginning of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented modality of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A maxi display project, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimension and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, we will have the impression that by looking at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elimina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recompose into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertisement, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of motorist communication.
Will it succeed with this formula in arousing the interest of future acquirers? We'll see.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the group "Ultras Italy" which follows the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, had never created big problems.
Nor had it ever clashed with the opposing tifosi.
The extraction of the group is right-wing.
The promoters are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (not much in reality) of Campania and Apulia were added.
They had tricolor flags on which their hometown appeared: Saturday night, they were all abducted so as not to be identified.
They are inspired by English twisting.
In Bulgaria, they found a tiffosery of real Nazists, that of the Levski.
The Figc had made available Italian tifosi, 144 tickets for the game: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had indeed controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian tifosi who had a history of stadium crime, did not have the right to the ticket, and could not make the trip.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and will then take measures: in this case, it may be that the tifosi arrested or identified in the disorder will purge a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that prohibits frequenting Italian stadiums, but also European.
In short, our hooligans will no longer set foot in the stadium.
Thankfully.
But now it is the time of fear-emulation: that is, others may be added to the first hundred and fifty.
"We must put out this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves like this," argues the Viminal.
So, "keep your eyes open especially in view of Wednesday's national team game in Lecce"
In Apulia is indeed a small core of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, meets the Observatory, Tuesday the Casms which can even count on a section of the Aise, that is to say secret services, which are precisely concerned with stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the outstretched arm during the Mameli hymn? In Bulgaria, this is not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really not pleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently, director of the Observatory of the Viminal (he took the post of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect in Trieste where a core of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002, resides.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 tifosis has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the No. 1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the Country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group had stayed in the rules, now we will see what happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles towards the Mameli hymn: those too are not crimes, but if you allow me, they are not polite..."
Students who are victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student rental market has no crisis
According to the latest Sunia survey, the tenants' union, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euro in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families of origin must support - explains the head of the design office of Sunia, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the strong demand from the students has so distorted the market that a process of general increase has begun even for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also involve a series of violations: free, unregistered, rent-free, sub-leases, contracts.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the tax review are needed to calm prices.
Reading in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, we go from 650 euros minimum (Bande Nere zone), at an average value of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria zone)
In Florence, a bed costs on average, 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and from 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), we ask about 600 euros for a single, 450 for a bed in a double.
Slightly lower values (550 euro for a single) for areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can only save if you move away in the peripheral areas: 300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a single in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a single, we spend from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for bed, it takes 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the urban economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rentals are often taken by extra-community students, there is a subsequent anomaly: the rent required of foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradiso, cities element historic halls.
Historic cinemas close in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the major Italian urban centers, but also in the provincial cities,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of large multi-halls, and the death of consumption of single-rooms in the central areas of cities, is one of the major events that seems inevitable and indisputable to us; it also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical places and full of memory, "it is as if a friend of mine disappeared, someone we know, with whom we have shared a piece of path and so many emotions" observes the director of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso, a film that offers to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar and the Grand Prize of the juror of Cannes, and who told the poetry of a cinema.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of traders, mean: in the last five years, 316 cinemas of the traditional type have closed, and it is the cinemas of the main cities that have mainly paid the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, the Roman Emilia is in the lead with 82 single cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The proof that confirms and that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is indeed the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-hall cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian farm has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would still be necessary to guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a room closes in a city, these frequenters are not necessarily all willing to go to the multiplexes.
Not to mention the failed deliberation of credit in favor of traders: the state's antecedent debt is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about these closures, decided to solve the situation thanks to the signing of a protocol between the City Hall and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote the single-room cinemas of the historic and peripheral centres.
Among the planned standards, there are tax facilities measures in favour of managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area, and will have special rates for parking and some car parks.
"This is an initiative that I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna putting in place other measures.
It is obvious, however, that in order to contrast the superpower of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that for me, has always been important: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New cinema Paradiso" that I was already thinking about for 10years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have experienced so many shared emotions, I turn to the other side not to see the panels blackened by the dust.
Links between politics and ‘ndrangheta, decree mayor of Gioia Tauro.
“The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choices of the Town Hall to the interests of the Piromalli clan.”
Heavy accusations are made by the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria, against the mayor and the vice-mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The controllers also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his grandson lawyer, namesake of the boss, already convicted for association of criminals of the mafia type, as well as paying 10 million euros.
"an affront to legal and moral normatives, and especially common sense," write the prosecutors, the two local administrations had expressed the will to pay consultations to Master Piromalli.
"Thus, the clan would have been granted - write the judges - to officially enter the town halls facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and orientation of the public administration"
The president of the Calabrian regional committee Agazio Loiero, does not hide only "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there is more than one" in his region: "there are places where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest
This morning’s arrests follow those of last July, following which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
By the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still because of alleged conditionings between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been relieved of their function to administer the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed leader of a center-right coalition, after the ballot in May 2006.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused the Deputy Minister of the Interior at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing him of having planned everything for a political question, but given the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even managed to ask for the variation of the project of the A3.
On the basis of the ordered interceptions against Dal Torrione, the pm write, emerged "the readiness to marry the demands of a businessman, representing a better-known group, close to the Piromalli, standardizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy is born of the waves, now the bigs launch.
This is an disproportionate deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet's area and now the world's major energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colossi like Chevron have laid their eyes, and now try to get their hands on it.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years now, and in the 70's, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now environmental authorities and the new increase in oil are giving the sector a great boost
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the global electricity need could be covered by seaswell operating systems.
This quantity would be double that produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides.
Colossi on the attack.
The first company to focus on marine energy was the Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it would have been said a real revolutionary step.
Two years from this, more and more candidates among these companies, always dedicated to traditional energy, are betting on marine energy.
“Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies – said the spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil giant, to the business daily Wall Street Journal – and it is evaluating the possibilities of cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question, concerns the obtaining of a permit deliberated by the American Energy Commission, necessary to give rise to a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially considering that in Alaska, the Usa continue to extract oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a project for new excavations
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. From New York and Ocean Power to New Jersey, which are running the path of energy coming from the sea, and the sums invested to the present day, although their details are not known, according to observers, is of increasing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts talk about technology still in its early days, because marine energy does not dispel fears about the environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create a major problem for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a superior environmental impact.
"And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the sludge upwards and downwards, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure rotates a turbine which in turn, supplies a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through submarine cables.
For the time being, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a shopping center and parking using six underwater turbines from the East River of New York.
The movement of water during tides, rotates the blades of the turbines, creating a rotary movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant announced that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permissions to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they tell the Institute for the Research of Electrical Energy, deserves at the moment, the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from the wind, the sun, or the waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on the energy of the tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, look to the coast, have invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and expects investments up to 35 million in 2009.
