The UKIP residents who refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You talk about when Nigel Farage says that the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the UK for health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he says yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the undesirables.
First you use specious arguments, then you discredit them with thinly veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to queue up behind chronic hypochondria intolerant people who think they are all owed.
I think you are the one using specious arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-wing crackpots, practically does not exist.
I think that's called democracy.
Then no one would be affected by UKIP's measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
Only in the parallel universe of UKIP can Carswell appear as a revolutionary.
A quote from a tea towel does not constitute evidence.
Yes, shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, it only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I do not think you know what a specious argument is.
You also know nothing about my personal situation or identity, so you should be careful when trying to kill the debate with accusations of homophobia.
Farage's sentence came as a surprise, but only because this problem is so rarely discussed.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're going to have to get over it.
I'm not sure what you're getting at, but I guess you don't like it when the media talks about what you don't like.
It is so rarely talked about because unlike Farage and his crazy Thatcher followers who think AIDS and floods are a sign from God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, then no.
In the end, the situation is as rotten in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis coming, the period of austerity will not have helped anything.
Hoping for almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland the "TIGER OF EUROPE" we were boasted a few years ago.
We knew the rest!
This starts reading the article again.
There is an attempt to make people believe that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a "NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE" is happening.
With the agreement of Brussels, taxes on the lowest companies in Europe, a very flexible labour market, an emigration that continues.
With these ingredients not enough to "boast" for the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 80s of the twentieth century, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, along with Portugal.
Greece was in front.
That their development has not been a long quiet river, it is sure in view of recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
It's not true!
Latvia has a 0% tax rate on companies.
Now there is real hypocrisy in France on the part of politicians on taxes actually paid by multinationals.
According to a report released in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only SMEs pay full price.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars on every street corner, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily traffic jams since the start of the school year.
Is it supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will get heated up soon.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astras are involved in a collision on the A140.
Does Ryanair now intend to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I believe Mr. O'Leary will soon be buying a whole new fleet of aircraft, so some dents and scratches on the old ones will be quickly forgotten.
That said, I'm flying with him next week, so hopefully it won't be on one of those two once patched up.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other driver.
Did Ryanair charge passengers extra for the extra fear they were kindly provided?
But without these kinds of Irish businesses, you couldn't afford to go on holiday, young man.
I have never taken Ryanair and the last 3 times I flew was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can have a blast.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair towards those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay something other than the base fare just have to blame themselves, etc.
It is quite transparent.
Ryanair will not be happy with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether passengers will have to be compensated and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was a mistake by the airport's air traffic controllers.
The passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
Sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight taking British ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Safe travels
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally teeming with people.
People do not come en masse for the quality of the restaurants (any, for the most part) or for the Salon de la revue at the Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for the crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With a lot of foreigners spending.....
Do you think opening on Sundays will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sundays, full of people with 50% tourists.
@aloes wrong!
The only argument that would seem to me admissible is that of areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is qualified by the fact that they buy tax-free.
Tourist areas lose a considerable volume of turnover every year for the same reasons.
There remains the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sundays, makes it possible to lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right enjoyed by employees, with some exceptions.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister for the Economy nor, for that matter, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has the slightest competence to reform the Labour Code.
While they loop it.
What is the law for?
To satisfy part of the population and companies who wish to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sundays I take my grandchildren to the municipal library.
In my city of 30000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture ...
And this is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he tenaciously defended against fascism
the way of life he tenaciously defended against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's estate was, against her will, used to pay the inheritance fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some not terrible.
No doubt his estate would want his piece of the pie, if you will pardon the expression.
his preference for a nationalist/Franco victory in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
Me neither.
But for 5 years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 he stood up to the other aristos in the government who wanted to discuss a "deal" with the Nazis and he very cleverly won.
With his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The people of the United Kingdom, and of France, and of Belgium and, ultimately, the whole world, can thank God for having had during these five years, just those five years, Churchill at the helm and no one else.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
If his descendants sell the paintings on the open market to raise the money from estate fees, they might even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them raise the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was "the moment of truth," Churchill's personality was a positive advantage to his country during the Second World War.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only favour large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, infrastructure projects being by definition not very renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the minister, they reflect the real French evil: mistrust of dialogue.
Back to originator values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the weakest among us not be in need!
Either jointly and severally we come to his aid, or, he is ENTITLED in exchange for the services he renders or has rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to the minimum wage corresponds to this vision.
There is also the landlord who lives on the income from his properties.
It is necessary to differentiate between those who invest for a return at the time of retirement and those who live on their pensions.
A property for rent or even two for a couple above, it's vice
The little genius of Finance is singularly lacking in imagination.
The New Deal was a policy of major works, but at a time of lack of major infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of degrowth is emerging in response to a recession that is only a wild and therefore brutal degrowth.
You would have been right 30 years ago: no need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investment is crying: insulation, renovation of the rail network, urban transport, transport and energy storage, etc.
A tax system that favours high incomes and pensioners.
Who is in power?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is truly a galloper.
Samsung's profits are undermined by the iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
Apple's™ mid-September introduction of larger screens for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have appealed to buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided on the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not to Apple.
I believe that it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft implemented this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple, and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms, to stimulate competition and development.
In addition we all have different needs and they cannot be met by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people do not attach any value to design, for them options, functionality and price take precedence.
There is nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for "a better platform."
Is there "a better car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving laptop industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It is healthier and should be encouraged.
That is in all of our interests.
I'm glad you found exactly what you were looking for and it's not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our UMPFRONTIST friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, of course Parisian bobos) tell us which authors they fight ideas on gender and indicate the works they intend to fight.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Valeurs Actuels?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I like you, and you are an intelligent and cultured person.
I said that about Judith in the vein of Furusato evoking Holofernes, a rapprochement that had not occurred to me (I do not have her quick wit).
Otherwise, in the "background", since you refer to it, this subject does not interest me, and sincerely I do not see what the problem is: I hoped that you and your friends could get me out of my backwardness, because I am slow but I understand well...
@ Jean: recognize that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holofernes does.
Who is afraid wonders the World?
But what do those who are afraid of?
Furasato and @ give us some answers.
The first by invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat slicer.
We see how much these studies touch the most intimate in them.
We are obviously no longer in the debate of ideas.
It is something else, much deeper.
@ Did you read, John, that Le Monde published an article on the necessity of theology?
@ : Being a debate of ideas I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
To claim to fight ideas from the sole exposition made by their detractors (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Gender Theory or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem to me very rigorous.
But hey, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend it's the difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I am not sure that the nuance is understood.
I did not read Judith, the very symbolic throat slicer, I was content with the "Second Sex" (it was more of my time) which is I believe the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
While watching the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed up when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated a little for the disappointment of sometimes having the view blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud really encircled the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
Special blood moon flash.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey make Labor responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will give it back its true colour as soon as possible.
You're obsessed with it, isn't it?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I only saw clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the week of the Perseid meteor shower and for virtually all the significant astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm starting to think there's an evil genius whose sole purpose is to prevent the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, although things are improving greatly on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I couldn't see the eclipse because of the clouds over the Melbourne suburbs.
I will put a TAX on this eclipse.
ANYONE watching this eclipse should pay a TAX.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before bed.
Who or what will obsess you when it ends up (inevitably) disappearing?
It seems like you spend a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse THEM of being obsessed.
Great photo of the moon over Sydney's Harbour Bridge.
It looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth!
Nothing about stock market and real estate speculation.
Nothing about inequalities between labour and capital income.
Nothing about tax evasion.
Ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
No hyperlink to the original documents so that one can form an opinion.
See today, Tuesday, October 15, the results of the miracle recipes: in Spain, exports are at their lowest in five years.
In Greece the stock market is collapsing.
Yet these are apparently the examples to follow.
The reform of notaries would generate a compensation claim of around 8 billion euros.
Economía tells us that these claims are unfounded.
What if the Ministry of Economy makes an error?
Will the decision-makers who reaped the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack on notaries have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The rest in its time.
Ok, thanks, JYL....
@lol No, the State is not comparable to households with regard to the management of its budget because the time horizon of the State is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the lifespan of its members.
Moreover, unless public spending is considered unproductive, it helps to finance tangible and intangible investments that are a guarantee of tomorrow's growth and therefore of future revenues.
Some answers.
An unfortunate decision.
But remember the sacred Hippocratic Oath: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved above all else.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately the truth does not match your fantasy.
Medical staff would like to be able to use it, but their hands are tied by the law as written by the politicians.
It is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgeries, safe shooting rooms for addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues the politicians want to please the uneducated masses.
By the way, doctors don't make money from drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't make money on drugs Since the Liberals want our health care system to look like the U.S., you should find out how it works.
All over the world doctors are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been ill-worded to blame the toubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, prioritize corporate profits and "research."
So read the few reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme spending and negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare global prices of drugs everywhere, as well as differences from country to country on what is over-the-counter or prescription-only.
It is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations for oncological pain, despite laws that curb them and expensive permits required.
While manufacturers of some drugs may not be happy with alternatives such as marijuana, those who achieve a version that offers good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
Sorry to tell you madam but you are wrong, there is a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and the pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a manager of this hospital.
You can't HOLD patents on grass...
If social scientists were doing research instead of politics and networking, perhaps their "work" could be used.
A researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
To compare is not to search.
To compare is to do pedagogy not research.
We cannot say "the research is complete, we must apply it" and then in the same jet "we must experiment at all costs".
If your research is successful, why experiment?
If your research is not complete, why are you asking for it to be applied?
Can someone explain to me how a "researcher" can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies make it possible to learn on the condition that students learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they do not know how to learn?
Pisa tests are only an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What is the point of building an indicator that informs you of what suits you, a desire for self-promotion, a deception?
There is only one way to train teachers: to keep sophists and ideologues away from training and that practitioners teach practitioners.
Fabrice reread the paragraph on internships (which unfortunately is not very argued) and you will see that your conclusion pushes us to the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device that leads above all to the reproduction of practices in force, and which does not allow to advance the system".
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, it cannot be hoped that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have their place in modern teacher training.
Educational theorists must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated on by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating room before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems in the education system.
To give more weight to educational theorists would be to destroy it once and for all.
Your analogy is totally flawed: if I would not like to be operated on by a practitioner who has only theoretical training, I would even less like to be operated on by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned on the job.
Mike Weatherley, the Conservative MP responsible for fighting copyright infringement by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thanks.
If one day I start to feel guilty about infringing copyright, I just have to read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement = theft.
It's the same since they have to cite their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license costs nothing.
No, it is a copyright infringement.
Not the same thing at all.
By using content without proper licensing, you deprive artists of their livelihood.
You can always debate pedantic hypotheses – but that's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't become true.
This is a copyright violation.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating copyright
Obviously you don't mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school assignments, an almost perfect definition of what should be reasonable use, then I'm happy to deprive them of that fictitious income.
Lesson 1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and post it on their favorite social networks, they give up all intellectual property to the site under the terms and conditions they passed with a click.
Maybe if they share the headphones of their mp3 player with a buddy on the school bus, they should be kicked out for breaking the law in such a way.
Ah, if we could export this resource that we are full of, the grumbler who says everything is bad....
If it is a PS MP who says so, then we must believe it.
I have 2 children and when they are old enough to choose, I would advise them to leave the France if nothing has changed by then.
The France pulls people down by continually assisting them.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy will have created.
What pulls down the France are speeches like yours.
@gus I have always worked in a private company.
I was LUCKY to have worked in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I am an employee because I know that I do not have the skills to run a company and this choice allows me to shoot red balls on the null bosses that I meet frequently.
Comfortable in my sneakers I totally share Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan's post: he tells the horrible truth!
@gus, if we compare with German companies that French business leaders constantly cite to call for reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large companies and medium and small - What are French bosses waiting for to do the same?
Let the state hold their hand?
This state they accuse of incompetence?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-business leaders couplet from you!
Remind me, what have you created as a job, as an added value, to be so severe?
@Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, the France is facing an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders unable to create jobs and who sulk and undermine while waiting for permanent assistance from the State!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employers' contributions, taxes, working 45 hours a week paid 35, and some, walking on eggshells, dare to demand lower wages if not their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the "negative" comments on this topic.
Which is ironic considering how people always complain about First Group.
From what I see from where I am from, Last has not really been an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to stay afloat rather than transform.
That's not to say Scotland's railways haven't improved since Last took over it.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do that, alas.
I've tried to get them recently, but I haven't succeeded.
But hey, Labour is going to get us out of trouble, isn't it...
It is an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
There is nothing to stop people in the UK from setting up a more moral business and taking part in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at management, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and the criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all for the decision to be reversed.
And there's more: MTR, a Hong Kong company, won the contract to operate Crossrail for 8 years.
Well, Labour, as they told us during the referendum campaign, is totally for pooling and sharing and believes that workers should all help each other across borders.
We can therefore assume that they will be happy with this decision;)
Perhaps it is because the management of the Dutch is on the right track while that of the British is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but above all new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
"She was a fighting girl."
Lord, I hate, but I really hate this kind of expression.
Supposing that being "fighting" is a higher quality than many others, concern for others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "fighting" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancer "fighters", who are nevertheless dead, I know palanquées.
Coming out of an illness has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, let's start again too.
I'm not telling you that this is THE condition to manage, I'm telling you that it HELPS.
Nothing to do with any merit...!
As for the examples of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I'll do it again.
To insinuate, even for a moment, that one can have merit in coming out of an illness or that one can demerit not coming out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body either follows or does not follow.
A body that gives up, everywhere, despite the will, despite the confidence in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
Sorry to think otherwise, if, having a solid morale probably makes it easier to accept heavy treatments and to prepare for them, to try experimental treatments as this woman did and not to refuse them out of fear.
Someone who is a fighter in medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts medicine.
But if we prefer to rely on the "lord" it is something else.
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are peculiar to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you get robbed to the point of becoming just a zombie.
Personally I caught two, dirt, fat, and if I "fought" as these fine psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight is all about gritting your teeth, suffering hell and taking the blows.
I thought that the accusation against Milosevic had been decided and finalized about ten years ago.
I have not seen that name in the newspapers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's an anniversary.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted "quickly" and then swept under the rug.
Is this the story we told at the time?
The communist-turned-nationalist who started three wars in the Balkans in the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what has been deliberately left out: 1.
How could NATO bombing be legal under THE LEAST rule of international law?
Which country did Serbia attack?
Speaking of RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed this same building killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, he would be swallowed by the Western compressor roller.
The West used a smokescreen to detach a part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was quickly recognized by Western states who then lied from start to finish about the situation on the ground.
The Serb population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term for failing to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in politics at the time.
In the end, the Guardian should not call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we didn't like him).
To my knowledge it is only in Greece that a method of predicting earthquakes works roughly, by measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
These kinds of studies are undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results with us.
This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to have detectable water molecules", according to a study conducted by the team of Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
Method to follow then.
Just like those that involve animals sensing a threat coming.
Thank you Passeur de sciences for regaling us, often, with these experimental feats that are achieved in the world.
How would animals know (in advance)?
Probably by the perception of other elements whose rate evolves in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon for example.
A gas a priori odorless for humans but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable to humans, but not to the measuring instruments at their disposal.
But we do not have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act in a strange way for a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen a report on arte telling the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their work which focused on the sensitivity of animals to the Earth's magnetic fields, and more particularly to their modification before a seism.
So of course I'm not a scientist but their hypotheses convinced me!
Where do we stand on this research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should learn to listen to nature again...
If you look at things calmly and rigorously, you publish it in a serious journal, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the "signs" given by animals, we come up against the same bias: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the goldfish was going around in circles.
I do not understand why anyone can think that Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He has done too much as Mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program you can't help but think that this man knows nothing about it and that he is always trying to distract with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He could not name a single point.
He made so many promises to get elected mayor and he didn't keep a single one.
It only underscores how the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of, right?
Because it is popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in "Have I Got News For You."
Because he's a celebrity and we've instilled in people the adoration of celebrities.
Londoners voted for him and so will the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the popularity rating of the Tories will break the ceiling I am sure.
God help us.
I'm not so sure: people love jokes, but don't want their prime minister to be one
That's exactly what they said about Londoners.
He should have brought with him his friend the cinder block, smarter than him.
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
Americans have had one as President.
The French have truly and always lost interest in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have taken the trouble to read a few books (there are some, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the "Solomons" and the "Strait of Scrap" speak, unfortunately as much as the dead who remained there.
It is understandable that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruiser, the Australia, must always be there at the bottom since the battle of Savo) do not want to go back.
We actually passed in front of Savo Island, in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even if the mission is coming to an end.
It's good the little ones.
But the ecolo side is a total smoke.
Calculate the kerozene consumes to achieve the goal totally discredits the concept.
Just browse the list of sponsors Only philanthropists.
One more com operation neither done nor to do.
The cow, it makes you want too much!!!
I'm looking forward to the web series!
Your recit makes me see again, identifying me a little in passing (I also learned to sail with the Crocos de L'Elorn at the Moulin Blanc in the harbor of Brest!).
Hats off also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Continue to make us see again, and to show with pride that the Bretons are great travelers!
Pierre, from Trinidad and Tobago.
Good evening I think that the red cap who demonstrated against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not devote a penny of our taxes to finance the dreams of a few adventurers, even as nice as those!
Are there any players in the current Serbian squad who are of Kosovar origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic at Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly at Juventus and now Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they are still in the team.
It is Bisevac the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was a midfielder or forward in the 70s and 80s and coached many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as a striker in Velez's great team which, under the tutelage of legendary Suleman Rebac, twice finished second in the Yugoslav league (and also featured greats like Vahid Halilhodzic and Arsene Wenger's loyal team-mate Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said he was going to become a great player when he was at Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn *thrill*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to Fener and as far as I know he's not a starter.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania is not afraid.
You should love Albania because you are neighbors.
The thing is, the flag of this drone is not the flag of the real Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is a significant Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there wasn't too much damage (as far as I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Greater Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give parts of the country to neighboring countries.
How can one have felt "an explosion of joy" seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and undoubtedly children are inside?
How???
What bothers me a little about this "testimony" is that the mere fact of having been able, even once, to spontaneously rejoice in the horrible death of thousands of people, testifies in my eyes to a "border line" personality whose "testimonies" should be taken with the greatest circumspection.
No doubt that at the short moment of "joy", we will not have thought about the deaths or the reality of the horror inflicted.
We just thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had managed to really and apocalyptically hurt the great evil Satan in his very heart.
To do qqch of powerful.
Grandiose.
It seems that this sentiment was shared by thousands of Muslims consumed by their sense of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfreude.
We suspected it a little.
The "Christian/white/Gallic" West cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the musuman when he contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of the Arab Muslim world today.
I am talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past splendor, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this diabolical funnel?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigate the Arab world: the bigoted conservatism of the powers that be and fascistic nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
That we understood it before, should not make Muslims back down.
That is the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I guess that's true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, wet and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Plus, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I suffer from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little with mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The countryside in particular is breathtaking in autumn.
Not as breathtaking as the green of summer when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We had a great summer this year, don't make your grumpy who rambles clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in winter.
But now I'm retired and I don't develop immunity to germs from outside, that can change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a feverishness that culminates with festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risk of snow and many other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things!
Here are my holiday recommendations for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child supplements, it is the amount collected by the State which comes essentially from deciles 8 to 10.
But with regard to the number of households that have seen their tax increase as a result of this measure, it is mainly deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned (median incomes) according to Figure 2.
The removal of the half share concerning especially widows is not at all covered in the article or rather its impact is completely underestimated: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And it's not about to get better.
Well, we are not on the straw certainly, but pensive
For once that the PS is doing a rather left-wing policy, we are not going to cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20% have to bear much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Let's continue like this and you will encourage that 20% to work less or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Long live the Trots and OCI recycled in the PS: they have understood everything.
Adam, you can't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is always the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from amassing as much as they can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money is overcome, money is only used to make money, that is to say, to make the misfortune of the greatest number.
We are among the richest 20%.
Probably also of the 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth, part of which is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must allow these households to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or you might as well give up and live on minimum social benefits, especially if you have social housing.
The utopias of Khmer Rouge head-choppers have fortunately lived.
I did two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things we wouldn't have had in a 5 star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the front desk or deal with any hassle.
Just go to someone's house, sleep there, tidy up behind you and leave.
From now on this will be my first option when I am traveling.
The logo has changed, the people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases you will need some kind of homeowner insurance.
Make sure you're using a service with the right logo!
Ah, 6 hours too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky" No, it's not true.
You just really ran out of luck.
According to the link provided in the article:
To his credit, Airbnb's response to Teman was quick, almost absurdly quick.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel, and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he has received no support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I am looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I'm considering paying a down payment and a month's rent at once but I'm a bit scared of sending £1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
But where are we going?
"Support the troops," sang Bu$herie in all tones...
Harmless weapons, therefore.
I am sure that it will please the families and loved ones of the thousands of Kurds who died in Halabja to learn that their relatives and friends have succumbed to something other than Saddam Hussein's chemical bombing.
Unless the content of the article has been drastically altered by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to be polite).
Moreover, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not very clear the style of the author: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You believe it's time to weaken the military to strengthen education
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are always at war.
Alternative: Is it ALWAYS the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if "the" people were made to work 35 hours instead of 17.
At the moment, our teachers currently earn more than engineers.
And let us not be led to believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their curriculum.
But it is not visible since the National Education does not have the means to provide an office at the college / high school to its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework in short, except that the employer does not pay for the computer, the internet connection, or the supplies.
Moreover, it is so much the hideout at 17h per week and 4 months of vacation that we can not fill the CAPES of maths, come, we are waiting for you.
How come you don't want to stick to poorly educated shit people whose parents spit on you by calling you a jerk?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadites so that the Khurde population can flourish better.
Where we see that the Bush administration has done absolutely everything wrong.
My first graduate job was in sales, in London, earning three times nothing and yet it was a position for which you needed a degree.
A year later I saw an advertisement to be a worker for the London Underground, it was paid £5,000 more a year and we didn't even apply for the patent.
I have never regretted it.
On this subject, don't worry if you can't find a graduate job, try to find something that either pays well or that you enjoy doing.
If I had stuck to graduate jobs, I would still be paying my student loan
I don't really like working in business, so I hope to eventually move into either the public service or academia.
LOL LOL LOL This article arrives really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a three-year backlog.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Get rid of the bisounours courses like art / letters / theater / media / philosophy / political science, i.e. what is called the diplomas of the unemployed.
I have one of these diplomas and I ended up as a production manager.
It turned out that the important thing was not the degree but, as the article above says, a good career path, starting at school and throughout university.
Certainly the starting salary was lower, but you quickly climb the ladder because in the real world what counts is the results more than the knowledge.
This debate between engineering studies and artistic fields has been going on for years.
Scientists can't solve all problems, it's more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time, and interact with people in a way that gets results.
Letters, philosophy and art are bisounours sectors?
That's ridiculous.
I assume you're talking about media studies like degrees or whatever abstruse track you went to.
Literature, philosophy, political science and art are real fields.
We need people who can explain the big issues to high school students, who understand the importance of the basics of culture like literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Wouldn't it be better to have a real territorial policy to relieve congestion in Paris and energize the rest of the France?
Personally, I do not see the inhabitants of the depths of Essonne and Val-d'Oise cycling 80km round trip every day to come to work in Paris.
The inhabitants of the inner city and the inner ring already have many much more convenient means of public transport (metro, bus, tram).
> Several secure and locked parks, as already exist in northern European cities, Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, space is cannibalized by 2WD.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
Might as well benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well we didn't find a place for ONE bike hanging device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, that's not okay at all.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other users of public transport the reasons why they do not pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that stand out are: 1 / it's super dangerous with all these cars, trucks, scooters that drive super fast and don't care about the survival of bikes 2 / we get a lot of pollution in the head For me bike paths are pis aller,  it is necessary to reduce car traffic (urban toll type congestion charge), reduce speed (Paris = zone 30), enforce the highway code by systematically verbalizing (even bicycles to the flat near that it is necessary to adapt the highway code written for cars 100 years ago to bicycles), generalize buffer zones after crosswalks,  Not before otherwise cars and scooters do not bother.
Bike paths are apartheid, we must coexist but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing about cycling in Greater Paris?
Not a word about the place of cycling in public transport?
EELV is right.
The target of 15% bike travel is ridiculous.
I'm starting to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in flour.
Moreover, according to what OR reports, the EELV deputies seem skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket begins, it would be better to find out who is really behind this massacre.
Hint: it's not Russia.
Not sure you like the way the world is evolving.
It looks horrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer has expressed his intention to take the case to the ECHR, but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been filed.
In addition, they would have to file a complaint first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect that these cases will be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not at fault, the fault lies with the authority responsible for the safety of the airspace, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident foreseeable?
Other planes had been shot down previously, Ukraine was launching air attacks against the rebels in the area and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Did the Ukrainian government take reasonable precautions in light of an obvious threat or did it choose to gamble with the lives of innocent people so that airlines pay for overflight fees?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls defending their usurping government/Western Ukraine's ultranationalists – and who want to demonstrate roughly that Putin shot down MH17.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what happens in their skies.
The precedent: a 1986 ruling by the International Court of Justice that concluded that the CIA's supply of weapons to the rebel Contra forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will let this case go to the ICJ.
It's funny to think that Abbott wants to tell Putin that Australians have been murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can present evidence to support his allegations.
So far investigators have said no such thing.
To be called Ricardo and to be such a Boeotian in eco, it's distressing!
To be called Polar is to lose the north is gratifying.
Only one question of Boeotian: is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I can't help but notice that those who most virulously criticize Piketty's book haven't read it!
It is easy to read, I took a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of labor income, capital ownership, merit and inheritance in the log term.
He shows that the concentration of capital today joins that of the beginning of the 20th before 1914, he shows that it was the 2 world wars that reduced the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, then how concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: You say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has some limits.
Then the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is fair, one can debate it without having read the book, the essence of which is to argue one-sidedly in favor of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did it take you to read it?
Is the central thesis of his pavement summarized by the press false?
I have not read and will not read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis and it is the one that seems to me pure sham.
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Has humanity not become globally richer?
And this enrichment added to an increase in population is the real political question today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the award without a doubt.
But remember that she is only 17 years old.
An age at which most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope that this award will not be a burden for the girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colorful perverts are the embodiment of evil.
All my best wishes to Malala, but she must realise that she is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or anywhere else - not even in the working-class neighbourhoods of Britain!
Did anyone think his speech was a bit strange.
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she wasn't where she is now, she would have been married at 14.
Isn't Malala herself one of those "colorful perverts"?
You should not have any "airtime" on this site.
You yourself are a horrible pervert.
It is absolutely appalling.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her off at 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
Her father ran a school where girls attended school and was in favour of equal rights for women.
He is, and always has been, for her to receive a higher education and have the right to decide for herself on her marriage.
However, he is unusual in Pakistan, as he believes that women are equal to men.
What she was saying was that the average Pakistani girl often has to marry at 14, without having a say.
Sorry she didn't say it eloquently enough for you.
It may seem contradictory, but perhaps she means that, if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14.
Rather disappointed by this introduction of season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who obviously has a little trouble finding her character of lookalike of Marlene Dietrich.
I just watched the last two seasons which are quite different but I must admit that it is one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The direction is close to perfection and Jessica Lange's show singing Bowie's anachronistic Life on Mars is simply stunning.
I haven't watched this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I would rather have it all of a sudden than watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is certain, apart from Jessica Lange extraordinary, it is especially the risks of staging and editing that amaze me.
We have in AHS an avalanche of original plans that ridicule the sanitization of today's productions.
It escapes me a little to see you throw in the towel in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say it so well, there are many other things.
No, it's simply that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and the way she uses it) is really ONE of the pillars of the series apart from the technical qualities.
And hey I watch a lot for her.
Then I find that the series sins by writing, it wants to do too many things at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in season 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's going to end up like 24 hours chronos what.
But hey everyone does what wants eh!
It is by what I say "I will not look again" that everyone is forced to do the same!
I simply share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think it will be fatal.
But then, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please – let's cut government spending instead.
No, let's increase expenses please.
Those who wanted to slash spending failed.
Triggering controversies over relatively small items of expenditure, such as development aid
The problem is that this is less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of direction that voters seem to be calling for, and all the while some on both sides are pretending that these nuances are far more important and substantial than they are - and voters see through their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenses.
"Debt" is assets held primarily by financial institutions in this country.
"Debt" is nothing to worry about.
I wouldn't mind the government appropriating a third of my income (before I even talked about consumption taxes) if I thought they were going to put it to good use.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been entirely honest about how to cut taxes but hey, if you add up our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies for almost useless wind turbines and nuclear power stations that cost double what they should, you come up with a figure that makes the Labour and Lib-Dem taxes on the most luxurious residences seem ridiculous.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone earning £35,000 a year will pay around £5,000 (one-seventh of their salary), someone with £50,000 would pay around £10,000 (one-fifth), etc. And someone with £200,000 pays around £70,000 (just over a third).
What about social security contributions?
Plus social contributions, plus local taxes, plus parking fees and car vignette, and that's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is deducted at source before local taxes and the car vignette.
I get paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let's not pretend that money is falling from the sky, or that it doesn't matter where billions of pounds in taxes go.
How can an unemployed person looking for door-to-door work prove this?
Even if 20% of the unemployed do not look, it means that 80% seek and do not find.
Being unemployed myself, do I have more interest in what others seek or not?
Whether a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 resumes, it increases my chances accordingly.
Indeed I have not heard from Pôle Emploi for months, does it mean that the agents are more busy with control operations than really bringing in job advertisements?
I do not see the point.
Because it is not up to the state to provide work.
If Pole Emploi does not provide enough jobs, then we must do without Pole Emploi.
Why is this a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we ensure that the unemployed fulfill their duties in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks for their ticket from the users of a means of transport, a head of department or are the employees of their work, etc.
No one cries foul in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had to deal with Pôle Emploi, my rights to the AER had been poorly established, and on one of the files, cut by 40%, it was necessary to fight firmly.
It takes time!
I am not an expert in law.
Filing and control are currently taking over, while statutorily Pôle Emploi is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern employees, they are the ones who pay the costs.
Politicians and French non-salaried workers grant themselves rights that they do not actually have!
This is not normal.
I would add that a dignified unemployment insurance contributes to the valorization of salaried work.
More than waiting for murderous tweets in Arabic...
In reality we need to have a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the Black Death in 1348/9 in connection with the war and population displacement at the time.
The Saudis had the presence of mind to ban this year's Hajj in Mecca for Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have had their visa applications denied because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox in Mecca during the Hajj in the 80s, probably infected by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from flying to Europe?
I thought it was common sense but apparently those "who know" decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be put under strict quarantine.
No one goes out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract Ebola while they are there, they stay there until they are cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Just last week, people were infected after having contact with people in West Africa despite taking "all necessary precautions".
We can stop the advance of this disease.
It spreads mainly through airlines.
Let us prohibit them from offering to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms so that they can be quarantined immediately.
Let him manage to convey the message of the first individual and the group (including religious) second and he will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he is able to erect as dogma the image of God characterized by the total of the planet's functioning cortexes.
It is still far from this conception.
It has only been 20 years since information appeared as humanity's given premium, while religion, from the cerebellum, directs our actions from Lucy perhaps.
What is the point of becoming yet another Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is largely a minority in France today, no one is forced to adhere to it.
Those who criticize would not set foot in the Church anyway, just look at the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxiety-provoking"?
@louise: Sorry the church does not have a vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe it will reach more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) respect for others as you envision it pre-existed Christ.
Hillel a century before him already said: "do not do to others what you do not want to be done to you, this is the whole Torah and the rest is comment: go and study!"
Christianity goes far beyond simple reciprocity but introduces agape.
Your "advancing justice, peace, fraternity" but without god?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Next step: the incarnation and resurrection are removed.
Jesus will remain the hero who upended moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace and fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I seem to recall that the small number of Protestants in France is mainly explained by the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then forcibly converted and forced into immigration a few centuries ago.
I'm too hesitant between buying this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
You can't make it up.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in its fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If you're interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll look.
Obviously not at work.
IT killjoys block all cool sites.
Hi, is it £30 then 20% off, or does the £30 include the 20% off?
Be careful though: the PC version is only for DX11.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but can't play it.
In addition I bought it on Steam, so no refund, it sucks.
It's time to buy a new video card *makes a face*
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I believe.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I would be afraid that one day they would delete it from your library if they decide to crack down on people who buy it there while they are out of the planned area.

So, was the France of 1940 a "putrid breeding ground"?
Say, this Nobel Prize seems to me to be a poisoned gift.
You have to love the France of 40, that of "the strange defeat"?
When we see who gets the Nobel Prize in Literature we wonder if Proust or Dostoevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even an event, we do not even want to read the award-winning authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians will read Modiano, which is already difficult to read in French and describes such a limited and egocentric universe?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Have you read it at least?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better for judging.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano at his true value, if they do not already know him!
For your part, continue to frequent Lévy and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep all their chances.
So let's see who got the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hi awful ones.
Since I drove one in Iceland, I can't stop seeing Kia Sportages everywhere.
I think this thing has followed me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like the horrible computer in Superman III?
Hello Dantra, still hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my medocs.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days off.
It was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham Beer and Cider Festival.
It was messy.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not only CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with camera fanatics).
Driving on the return on Sunday was really hard.
Monday night we went to a friend's grandfather's house to play nine card brag.
Thanks to a real beginner's luck I was able to leave with several decent bets.
I hope that if I get to 95 I will be as lively as him.
Last night I went to a fancy cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks arrived with a slice of bacon on it.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
Having said that, I do not want to upset you, but I think you are getting off topic a bit.
This famous totality, it prohibits quests for jihâdistes at the exit of mosques.
It promptly reports on arms trafficking.
Either we have our eyes wide open like Meddeb and Taïa or Boubaker or we have our eyes wide closed.
You have to choose.
It is not by keeping your eyes closed that you access the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you are making a monumental misinterpretation: all the authorities, organizations or associations representing Muslims, Muslim or not, having formally condemned ISIS and its crimes, the French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official condemnations.
Silence means consent.
The problem is that people like you see them primarily as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French people.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be foolish and indecent to accuse them a priori and demand that they demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt them.
This principle is in my opinion the negation of the republic and can only contribute to the disintegration of French society.
If there is no doubt, we might as well say so.
Who does not say a word consents, but consents to what?
Consents to proximity to ISIS or condemnation of ISIS.
Silence is very convenient, it is the main weapon of those who want to spare the goat and the cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the elections, "take revenge" on the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has opened up between their proposals for devolution and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified at the thought of losing all those seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives do not give a damn about Scotland because they have no basis there.
They can do whatever they want with electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that Labour losing seats in Westminster to the SNP is a good thing in the long run for him and the Conservatives.
Who will shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be totally eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut off their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMISE" thinking he was saving his party but not realizing he was signing the death warrant of his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs are holding their leader to account.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they can force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they promised for maximum devolution.
I think that is the important thing.
Not if Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Waxing the pumps by 8% at the expense of 85% is not a great electoral strategy.
In addition, once Scottish MPs can no longer vote on matters that concern England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think it is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists and it worked well for her.
Yet he is still in the running for prime minister in 2015 and has been since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is the "Lives of Others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
Eventually, this will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I'm waiting for the next post: Amazon makes YOUR book according to YOUR profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
It's a gay world.
Highly stimulating.
Thanks for the article.
As under this system, DRM management is not implemented, I still have to read pirated files, public domain books or purchased from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without a snitch.
Given the price I paid for the Kobo, it is without regret.
I am amazed at the widespread abdication of users in the face of widespread appropriation of their privacy.
At your general public bookseller, you will systematically notice that everyone gives his loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are arguably paltry.
For example "Finnegans Wake" by James Joyce.
@Thomas: In the era of Big Data, data doesn't really have to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all the literature in one bin.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile....
The harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that is, allowing neither to identify the readers nor the authors.
But Kobo has all this information.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements from the Turkish government in recent days that the country appears to be run by a kindergarten class full of schizophrenic kids on acid.
It's even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
It's interesting that some Erdogan supporters think Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well done :-P But Turkey doesn't want to shoot itself in the foot unless it gains something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will retaliate, so it is effectively shooting itself in the foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog: "The PA reports that Iran has warned the US that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear from the article whether Iran was sending a serious warning of retaliation there or if it was simply advising caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what is really surprising is that today Iranian and American diplomatic engagement is about Syria, Israel and the security of the region."
Reading Indian Punchline is highly recommended for anyone who pays attention to detail rather than the s**t swayed by the traditional media. The short article you link to is important and should be read keeping in mind previous realistic observations/warnings from Iran to Afghanistan around 1979 – 1980.
Who are these "moderates" who are seriously fighting the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline politics are pushing the world into the abyss and I would suggest to those who refer to non-existent "moderates" to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending other people's children to fight in World War III.
"It's even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism" Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in mind.
There should be a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should we?
Do you realize that neither criminals nor victims have any chance of being alive?
A little late for that, buddy...
Wouldn't criminals be barely old now, like 120 years?
A bit late for that, right?
Especially concerning the CUP triumvirate that planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after World War 1 in revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a remote place in Central Asia around the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding a Turkish empire there.
What a delusion!
An impressive mastery of the fallacy of the fatal slope, but apart from that, we seek in vain contact with reality.
So many clichés without argumentation.
The fetus will always hear a heart beating even in the womb of a surrogate mother.
Lesbian couples may simply have a desire to have children and not a desire to be accepted.
Hetero sterile couples too.
As for the children!
What a shame to designate them as psychologically unbalanced futures.
One day, they will be old enough to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn a living and to pay for the retirement of this lady (?)
Surrogacy is undoubtedly a temporary "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world is experiencing.
It is not new.
Many women bore and gave birth to children who were not their husbands.
It is still so, we are made like this...
The important thing in this matter is that this practice is framed so that the "commodification" of the body is limited.
But aren't cosmetic surgery and cosmetics also commodification of bodies?!
Anakronik Fareinheit ...
It is certainly more elegant to fatten a maid in a distant country via the internet and Pay Pal than to assume its responsibilities and or avoid scandal in another century close to home without shouting it at that time from the rooftops! ...
Moreover, these practices were not done in the name of the church! ...
It is not only Christians and believers who refuse these practices...
Nevertheless, the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh shut up, this man is passionate about something.
At the end of the 70s in the Midlands I only saw it from afar.
I had to go during the day because I wasn't allowed to go at night!
But if you liked it and you listen to music - that music today it still touches you as much.
I don't know why there are so many dismissive comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they're posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I believe that in the sports section there is an article on football waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there has been a dearth of reports that truly reflect the reality of Northern England culture.
No wonder Paul Mason has grasped the social and political context, he understands things well.
Northern soul still lives, but it has been vampirized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can check it out if you're in the London area in November: 99psoul will be playing soul vinyl, including lots of Northern soul, again on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I too thought "always the same story", but here is a well-written and well-thought-out little article.
Your criticism really needs to be more constructive.
Great article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're glad you escaped Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and get off at Wallgate.
By gobbling pills.
Whatever the station before Wigan it was Ince, 15 min walk to Wigan after buying a ticket for the stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the George Gently crime series entitled Gently Northern Soul, which takes place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is becoming more and more poisonous.
The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahu does not seek peace since he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (by the way, this was also the case with Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their voters all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock and entered the water.
An Israeli had stolen them from him.
The Israeli representative stood up angrily and shouted, "What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren't even there at the time!"
The Palestinian (UN) representative smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established.
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar Palestinian Authority government and will not let their guard down...
That this displeases the anti-Israelis is obvious, it is not the goal ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the world geopolitical report ...
And it is still so since politics is globalized ...
Avoidance, avoidance...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it continues!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What balance of power allowed the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a balance of power today!
Do you doubt it?!!! ...
Besides, it's not all about Russell Brand, but Guardian journalists seem to have a hard time getting beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
Much of what he says is just pseudo-Chomskyist blunders written by others.
This proves that you don't understand what Russell Brand is saying, or what Noam Chomsky is saying.
It's just a series of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes it, which would mean it's a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a hint of realization that Russell Brand is telling certain truths, perhaps truths that we prefer not to think about.
Hang on, this feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrifies some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously, and after all the tabloid nonsense he does sound like a rookie populist, but this whole thing about not voting has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that he's just telling people not to vote and instead sit back and ignore the whole political process – but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos he posted, he says that voting once every 5 years only for Labour or the Conservatives (or Lib Dems I guess) and limiting democratic engagement to that is completely unnecessary.  the two parties (to slightly different degrees) governing mainly in favour of special interests, multinational corporations and the rich, At no point does he say to simply ignore politics completely because these parties do not govern in our name: he insists that rather than just voting and disconnecting for five years,  People should become much more politically active at the local level, organize movements, demonstrations, petitions, whatever, and try to influence politics from that.
I'm not saying I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think being politically active in making your demands can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are weather vanes who will change their minds if they really risk losing the election), but it's infuriating to see all these condescending responses that say that this fool who makes Jesus tells young people not to bother. to vote and just hope that everything will get better because it's really distorting his arguments.
His solution is highly questionable and it would be nice if people debated what he actually says rather than simply labeling him as irresponsible and putting aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The thing about voting has been completely distorted.
The uselessness of slipping a ballot into a ballot box every 5 years annoys me deeply since my vote really counts for nothing.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and MPs who report locally to their constituents.
Furthermore, I dispute the idea that Russell Brand's words are not his own (written by others).
He is intelligent enough to have his own words and ideas, even if these are heavily influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counterculture that Suzanne would like to group under the label "pseudo-Chomskyist blunders."
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, for Suzanne to do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even nods added to the edit!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russell but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him on his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding what he's getting at.
It taps into a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by mainstream media – including the Guardian – for generations.
This "slingshot" reveals above all in my eyes that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time at the RDV de l'Histoire where professional historians have become a minority and where exchanges of specialists have been impoverished in favor of condensed ready-to-think such as Sciences Po for press kits.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to attack a culprit, a scapegoat.
They both develop very rational reasoning, but this rationality rests on these scapegoats who are the keystone of their thought.
Rather, I believe that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a culprit.
This is part of a very archaic thought, sacrificial thinking, which is also magical thinking.
We solve the problem of the relationship to the other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchic, neo-lib and / or libertarian slope (of the two terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing how to seek the help of the state for its markets) in the sense of the least state / not at all state in Foucault.
The old dream of the base that is beautifully self-organizing.
Her thinking is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt she does not stand up.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals mentioned here.
Nor support for that matter.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of its then god, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you probably read a chouya too quickly if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology for Khomeini.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer enjoy attacking Michel in this way...
Gauchet poses a profound reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty represented by the mechanism of adhesion in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.
To see this cabal orchestrated by hard-left humanities researchers who can't stand to do without allegiance to their mantras is pretty laughable.
The narcissm and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other "yellows" that I witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You have not had the pleasure of hearing from our Australian friends on this subject, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I last saw a Chinese man.
In London and they were friendly to me when they found out I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same of whites!
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the mid-20th century, and I still hear some of them making violently anti-white statements.
My father is not happy that his eldest daughter is dating a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are getting richer and richer, prosperity is spreading outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what I have been told, Russians are mostly prejudiced against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or face high levels of crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Yenisei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard the views of Australians on the Chinese and Aborigines.
It's really weird that a foreigner tells me that I can't stand the Chinese, when I've met two in my life (including one abroad), haven't had bad memories of them, all people are equal and, in fact, those in London have been very nice that's the only reason I remembered that they were Chinese.
Otherwise we do not remember who we meet, all people are equal, how to remember who was who.
You know what's weird?
Let you and the other Russian here talk about the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always date said White.
How many Chinese men are with white women, by comparison?
None, because there is a good chance that the parents of these white women would assault them PHYSICALLY.
No measure of the impartiality of justice.
However, it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left such as the union of magistrates...
@Marabout: Sorry, but the judiciary is frankly a right.
As for the Syndicat de la magistrature, it represents only 25% of judges.
If a measure of its bias can be made from the relativity of the application of laws in the courts, it requires that two obstacles be removed.
That of the political vision of the observer as that of the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
It then remains the obligatory tool of the law to refocus the evaluation on the fundamentals.
The extent of its non-observance in all judicial acts of judges, including prosecutors, makes it possible to distinguish between error and bias on the part of judges.
It would be futile to pretend that acts of justice are not divided between these three groups.
Pretension and ignorance are not part of an objective analysis.
And if all this is not analyzed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If only by statistics implicitly revealing that it starts from a very low base.
The previous preamble makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio.
That of corruption* of the judiciary.
Sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The area under consideration is that of the spoliation* of heirs committed up to the point of procedural scams* by estate genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession obtains 150 million euros year after year while benefiting from the coverage* provided by the quasi-judicial impunity* of the French notariat.
For the understanding of their mechanism, some of them was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this comes in with the so-called statistical improvement* moderated by the previous commentary, is that the judicial institution has produced, during numerous disputes between genealogists and heirs reluctant to be so despoiled, a whole body of jurisprudence contrary to all laws favorable to heirs.
Isn't the presentation of European statistics ignoring such rational criteria then an elaborate form of lies?
Prices surely totally prohibitive.
More equipment to scam the disabled.
You can say that, but my brother has one of those all-terrain tricycles, custom built to his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like never before a normal wheelchair, with bulky wheels and tires, could.
As they say, tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson might invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks EPIC.
I think the inventor of the Whill never had to clean dog poop on a caterpillar.
I'm sure my sister would love the off-road tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a penchant for longboarding.
Here there are hills that they would like.
The prices do seem high, but there really are people who put that kind of price in a bike, so "you see".
The all-terrain tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
Not all disabled people are poor, however.
Many of them have insurance of a reasonable amount at their disposal.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is, the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to charge high prices for things they know we need.
You can't really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it is just a draft, there are no plans to make it.
I'm GLAD the "long distance" wheelchair doesn't hit the market, because apparently there's no way to drive this damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 homes have been destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza, during intensive bombardment of densely populated residential neighborhoods.
Two million human beings have been trapped in Israel's blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockade!
This situation is unique in the world, an unacceptable situation, and it is also illegal, since this blockade inflicts a "collective punishment" on all civilians in Gaza.
"Entrepreneurs who work on their projects divert a little bit of their cement to the black market" ...
Ah that's not wooden language, rather concrete and armed the lady ...
References are there to support an argument or a fact.
Anti-Zionist...
Good cement goes into tunnels!
There is the black market for sure, and recognized.
Two million human beings have been trapped in Israel's blockade of Gaza since 2007.
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and a moral compass.
The US has a well-guarded field: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the necessary time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded him!
Do not forget also that after lifting it, Morsi reinstated the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Blockade is Israeli-Egyptian...
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built upside down from the people who have chosen their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you have thought it through.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the sharing economy, non-profit.
Many are only looking for a one-night stand on Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hoping for) in another way.
It is always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, owners and tenants who trust each other often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, bypassing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all this.
"That she rents on"?
No problem with the verb, what's wrong with your grammar?
The verb "to let" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you haven't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it complies with all safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers for permission to do business there (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it's really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and repainted, sunk, etc. ?
Houseboats are so slow that if someone tried to steal it it would always be close to where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates...
All these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our houseboats...
Where will you moor it?
No, Marine Le Pen is not right!
Populism?
There is no truth other than that which exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase of wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who defends whom?
Who defends what?
In 2017 the mass will be said!
Capitalism is not going to get poorer!
High finance, speculates, plays with our companies and therefore our jobs, with our raw materials, therefore our purchases, our foodstuffs therefore our food, with the health care structures, with our debts and therefore our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold.
All this for the benefit of a few hyper-mega-obese money.
Until proven otherwise, FH said: "my enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance".
That was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former Rothschild bank minister as Minister of the Economy, in order to better defend the interests of the banksters, who are solely responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there no one else competent?
What do you call it: flipping your jacket, pulling down your pants?
Primary and populist reaction
In fact, we don't really know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I'm not sure Spee really "refused" to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that neither side seemed sure of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee soon left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was rough at the beginning of the day; I don't know if this was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, the Falklands, where, in photos showing survivors being rescued, we see a calm sea in broad daylight.
In addition, rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, it doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
"There was some confusion among the German ships as to the fate of the two armoured cruisers, which had disappeared in the dark after ceasing fire, and a chase began.
The Leipzig saw something on fire, but as he got closer he saw that it was only a wreck.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, leaning and badly damaged but still moving.
After pointing his searchlights at the ship's flag, the offer to surrender was refused and he opened fire, eventually sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee ruled that the Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 10:15 p.m.
Concerned by reports of a British battleship in the vicinity, he headed north.
So, if this is true, the Germans, groping in the dark before the invention of radar, did not know that a ship had sunk, and therefore could not search for survivors.
They also thought that there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area that could have badly damaged them, so in confusion they fled to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they would have to fight their way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already harmed them and cost them about half of their ammunition, dooming them when they were finally caught.
Several voices are raised in the UMP to ask that it be written into the law that an elected representative definitively convicted is therefore definitively ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect left-wing elected representatives of course.
But noon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSE AN INSCRIPTION TO THE WALL OF CONS OF MAGISTRATES
When will trade unions be banned in sectors that are already protected?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by politicos whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to coax those who will take advantage of their irremovability to hinder the actions of real politicians, who really try to make things happen, not the beautiful talkers whose immobility is commensurate with their sufficiency.
I met them in the metro around noon with their little signs "pennies for justice" they came from the provinces and did not differentiate between Bercy and the POPB.
She supports the existence of politicized unions whose members put the enormous power they hold at the service of her party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing or even far-right trade unions targeted personalities on its side and waged a legal-media war against them.
Your claims are completely gratuitous.
If, currently, the right is making the judicial news, it is simply because it has committed acts that fall under it!
There is no example of a left-wing personality who has had so much to do with Justice, but not all those who have been the object of his attention have received preferential treatment.
On the other hand, it must also be remembered that the left-wing magistrates' union is not the only magistrates' union and that it is a minority.
For a minister to be so committed to supporting unions shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you mention may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great in the Chancellery, it is not a secret.
One now wonders whether the "mission" of some judges is not more dirty than instruct.
@gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is in the minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: You forget that magistrates are not civil servants like any other: they are the only ones who have the power to indict and incarcerate everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever returned?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I believe that even the most starving moron realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I'd be surprised if someone accepted the offer to them.
Many have used it as a springboard to start successful careers.
One Direction fills stadiums around the world.
Others went on to sell a lot of records or left for the West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is one of the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Celine Dion, Cliff Richard, all made the Eurovision Song Contest, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 70s and 80s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars of British television.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that's what happens anyway to most stars who don't participate in contests.
Few people manage to make others after one hit.
Anyway, most singers / bands can at best hope for three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever he is called, only has fans in the UK.
His fame comes in part from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock path, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar showmen who smoke weed in their father's garage and swing three chords on a poem in elementary school will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before even releasing an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that quickly turns to racism, because sacralist ethnologists present these distant people as infinitely superstitious and steeped in ritual bigotry, while most of their ways of doing things are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired.  like ours, practical considerations on a daily basis.
Except that you interpret recklessly in reverse.
So be it, but rather than saying that the drum is devoid of sacredness, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is like being reminded to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined object circumscribed to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article anyway.
It is deco ephemere to furnish the void.
Nothing more.
Great article, thanks.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacredness still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw away unscientific interpretations that last the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When will there be a comparative critique of disciplines so that we can laugh a little?
Because what applies to archaeology also applies to the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a healthy dose of modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, precious testimonies to reconstruct history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is fascinating.
This method is not very old and previously archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and knowledge, and could be wrong.
Nowadays we have such efficient technical and scientific means that the interpretation of excavations is better but can always be called into question by other discoveries!
Here we are in full (and old) polemic on the shamanism advanced by the prehistorian Jean Clottes (cf his book "The shamanes of prehistory", particularly the expanded re-edition of the scientific controversy, published by La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article
Do straight men like anal sex?
For you Mike, I could get started.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why can't we continue with three?
This diary is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the gutter?
No, but we are not against a play on that.
We couldn't watch a musical about it though, that would be too gay!
We could expect that kind of comment from you.
It looks like Mary Whitehouse has come back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost over, may I suggest you switch to The Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real, courageous journalists to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their own risk.
Rather than making people snicker with those childish ass jokes.
Not very clever.
Go away then.
If these "childish ass jokes" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
You also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh about it?
Nevertheless we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
Amateur video of the crash on the net... ??
If FOM has chosen not to show these images it is only to protect its interests in no way those of the pilot.
If FOM had wanted to protect the drivers, it would have taken out the safety car when another vehicle (tow truck for example) entered the circuit.
But it was necessary to finish quickly before the typhoon which we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not see fit to advance the time of departure (TV law, advertising, money ...).
But other than that they protect the drivers well.
Of course, I also share this opinion.
But there is also that if the very British FOM brings in the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance to beat the Englishman who was then leading...
You let loose on this blog my dear Dayrton.
But it doesn't matter, I have a little time to flush out all your c*****ries.
No, just no.
There have been lots of conspiracies in F1, but never one that puts stewards in mortal danger for a distant story of one driver winning at the expense of another.
It's not FOM that takes out the safety because it's the FIA.
Size shade.
In view of the amateur images, the absence of an image allows the FIA to avoid embarrassing questions such as: How is it that the stewards wave a green flag in the middle of the intervention and continue to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because we clearly see one of the stewards waving a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that we are no longer under a yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark meconaissance of F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the yellow flag regime AFTER the place of the accident, hence the green flag waved.
This is the usual procedure.
The commissary station just downstream of the accident (depending on the case, it can be 10 meters or 100 meters after the accident) waves the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal pace.
Sensationalism sells advertising.
I used to think that the media was an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm afraid that, in the end, it's just for the money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, the fear of not having a sex life, advertising and the media are good to sell us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The news does exactly the same thing.
Making the buzz with information that we really don't need to worry about is just to continue to scare people so that we can continue to control them.
"When the tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch fear" It should be "derailed," not "cough."
Given the medical reference, "coughing" is much better said in this context than "derailing."
I wonder if all the people who panic that Ebola could start spreading by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You are doing them too much honour.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You confuse Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that ridicules this abject pseudo-journalism nicely and solidly.
It made me laugh.
It depresses me that the media talks about most things with this upside-down optimism.
The goal is once again to keep us scared and anxious enough (without hysteria) that the government can make us slip when it needs to.
I think it makes perfect sense that, if we have to endure a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises of its own making.
Isn't there something fundamentally problematic with the idea of ruling by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and for still being of this world almost 35 years later.
Moreover at the beginning it must have been horrible, given the context of the years 1980-90.
I am bluffing, living with the certainty of passing there for years .....
Perfectly useless testimony.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only are testimonies useless: taken in isolation, they cannot be used as scientific material.
But they have a detrimental influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@trafic: Testimonies cannot be used as scientific material.
Perhaps that is why we refrain from asking psychiatric patients questions when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric file mentions that my psychiatrist mother explains that I was educated telepathically by her stepmother.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's rubbish, it's subjective testimony of no importance.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and the effectiveness of new treatments) is useless in a scientific approach?
What do you base the research on, then?
On fantasies?
You put on the same level fanciful theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
"Resilience": the phony word adored by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who think they are great psychologists after reading D'ansembourg.
@Jim: There are plenty of meaningless buzzwords among shrinks.
Cyrulnik gave us the blow of "resilience".
As he is a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope that he will have cobbled together a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could save us all from Farage and company??
Doesn't that remind you of Team America?
Seriously, it's *not* a good idea to bring the Sentinels out of the air...
And why?
It was a great series and it seems like those who release it are aware of it!
So let us leave our salvation to the Almighty who can work miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids hooked?
The only solution that comes to mind is the humor like pee-poo, which would kill the series.
It was already a children's series.
The children were hanging on.
Ah, because it's a children's series?
UKIP works for the Mysterons.
So keep your Team America.
Still in Supermarionation?
It will not be the same if you do not see the wires and the animation is well done. :-)
I can't wait to see this (despite being an adult), but I hope it will give a channel the idea to rebroadcast the old ones.
The series almost never stopped airing here in Australia; We've had one-hour episodes on Saturdays and Sundays at 6 a.m. for at least 40 years.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it has been on one of the second-rate commercial channels and can still be seen at these times.
And in addition the half-hour episodes now pass at 05:30, Monday to Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a "sad" 60-year-old guy, but I don't watch this show every day!
There is no "Temple Mount" in or under the mosque of the esplanades!!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all the Israeli excavations below and around the mosque of the esplanades for several decades have yielded nothing.
The temple mount if it exists it is elsewhere.
Maybe in Argentina??
This mount is not sought after for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of the mosques was built.
Its summit, or Dome of the Rock, protrudes from the middle of the Mosque of Omar.
For Muslims, Muhammad ascended to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it was Mount Moriah where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac.
As long as it has been taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, it is good to recall regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the 2-state plan, and scuttled it continuously!).
It is also good to show how the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Will God be able to recognize His own?
The shortest of Jewish jokes: "Praise be to God!"
To brag about tourism in Israel, we are often shown half-naked naïad youth, languishing on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what the advertisement shows us, as can be seen in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a bit scary though.
And this photo is a magnificent work of propaganda!
Too bad the Reuters photographer didn't take pictures of the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to enter the Temple Mount and who prefer to stone the Jewish worshippers below, praying at the Western Wall.
@Mat, If this photo bothers you, it is rightly, it is neither the newspaper nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she transmits that must be condemned.
This system is not sustainable and will end in tears.
The only way to put an end to this system is revolution.
Since the economy seems to be spinning, large companies have benefited tremendously from their employees.
They have managed to convince their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to raise wages, while at the same time and without hiding they have given ever higher salaries to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not sustainable, but it will only change in this country when workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of moaning and moaning when someone else strikes, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that you don't piss people off with impunity.
Unless democracy is abandoned, in which case it is, it is tenable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like for example China and India.
All this cannot end well.
It is because we are in a democracy that it has held.
Did you vote for TTIP?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to increase the profits of companies owned by these people by bypassing national governments through secret courts.
It sounds unbelievable, but that's exactly what the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanism proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people to the unimaginable damage this agreement will have on our lives.
It is only recently that it has started to be talked about in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement Look at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated behind your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat and tears"?
This makes excellent spin-offs, while digital money has no reason to fall, let alone grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the automotive market.
This gentleman is right, in the XVIII there were unions in all the regiments
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let her (well, her officers, the others, nobody knows anything) believe herself to be the safe of the eternal values of the France, and she will fight and shut her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this little relic is comforting.
Even if for her, it's more and more uncomfortable...
You still miss the sindicate of married men, single men, married women, single people, lost dogs and I don't know what else.
If you don't write French correctly, I'm unionizing.
You are warned, it will be your fault.
For the defence of sectional interests, we already suffer enough from the protected professions with trade unions, which has created a break in equality with other citizens.
Please do not laugh about a public servant's fear of risk.
One can very well imagine a system ensuring a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise disaster assured.
And with the carts getting ready, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since this is the subject commented here...
Let us delete "through its delegates" in Article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker shall participate in the collective determination of working conditions and in the management of undertakings".
This is absolutely essential with the eruption of informative power.
And yet you opened, presumably read and commented on an article specifically entitled "The Great British Bake Off review". ?????
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought we had to start the conversation.
Anyway it was Joffrey's wedding that I watched, and I can tell you that some were well seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding we have one of the best moments (although misleading: it was the wine) in the history of television.
Also, mmmh pie...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely, the show ends with a victory for the least worst baker; No one was like, "Boom, here's my fucking cake now eat it and bow to your master"!
Maybe the extra pressure from friends and relatives outside finally had an effect on them?
In previous weeks, all these outsiders were kept away.
And there's also this idea of "playing it safe, there's always next week" that disappears in the last week.
I like to cook but I can't imagine doing that to myself.
I am grateful to those who do it and thus give us great entertainment and push us to try new things.
Let's go for GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's last challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to make them and they had to tinker with one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to decide, I don't know how they could have chosen a winner.
With Luis, the only real flaw they could find was the somewhat dry base (although I agree with Hollywood that the green icing on Richard's mill did not make you want, anyway Richard had already lost at that time).
I must admit that several challenges in this series seem a bit artificial because of the time available.
There is also cancer lurking, with solar winds.
Definitely, everything is succeeding us at the moment.
A bad time to spend for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UV is blocked mainly by the ozone layer which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there wouldn't be enough solar wind to "chase" ozone from the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and "cancers".
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a bunch of useful functions that you don't suspect.
If we limit ourselves to humans they have the interest of allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to heat us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic UVC and allows UVA and most UVB rays to pass through.
You know you don't have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor a dweller when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor clarification that was implied in the commentary, which itself intends to be pedagogical.
Without saying that I am used to melanoma, UV only ACCELERATES its development.
They do not PROVOKE it.
As proof: not all tanned people have melanoma.
Or, when a toubib tells you that you must avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen because UV is necessary for any human.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it to the blender?
or put it in a blender...
I believe that the majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be folded if you apply sufficient force and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use for which it is intended.
I think the military needs something more resilient and therefore has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as a frontline communications hardware.
But for the rest of us,
It's still a good choice.
The majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be bent if sufficient force is applied.
Except a Nokia 3310.
Specifically, is it already folded?
We make this joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth folding joke I've read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like that.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production line and it is difficult to see how it could return to it.
So, hmmmmmmm................
Most likely, this is a production unit on which iOS has not been installed properly and is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I have no idea how they do this stuff.
But, would they put test software on all of them?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of an FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
Ah the article for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that manufacturers produce in "industrial" We put forward super u but all the brands and even the small business are concerned How to eat good, organic avac 1650 € (average salary in france)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After that, everyone is free to put their priorities where they want.
For me, food is one of them.
Go without rancour, I kiss you
We call bobos, or better boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological "software" that leads them to disconnect from reality.
This is total thought-reason unbundling.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example claiming to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartuferie, joining the left-caviar, from which they sometimes come, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not support this mixture of heavy-handed ideology and tartuferie so do not be surprised to often encounter criticism about them.
Wow, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theorization as well as for all the associated details (plane, shower...).
I'd love to be part of it, but I can't find myself in it.
The concept is not that complicated.
Boboecolos are monobloc.
Did you understand the concept of left-caviar?
Well, you are able to understand the concept of boboécolo.
It is the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in environmentalists at all.
The boboecolo is part of it but represents only the most visible fringe of ecologists because it is the one that infests the media.
Here is a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look this giraffe in the face.
She is so badly made that she vaguely resembles a female nude.
Shhh, you're missing the point.
One must be part of the microcosm of art to understand the staggering beauty of truth in this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to make a comment since you haven't spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not the fact that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic ability.
That's *art*.
No, it's pig.
The fact that Emin doesn't know how to draw
That is not really a proven fact.
Rather, it is an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can enjoy are realistic reproductions of dogs smoking while playing pool.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is much more than just representing reality.
If you're only looking for that, a camera will do.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the picture speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you may prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still room for savings: riding activities, the number of horses in the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer on active service.
Honesty obliges us to say that the France is reducing its numbers, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastically, starting with Great Britain.
This is only half encouraging...
The operational without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A singular approach, at a time when we are observing the weaknesses and inadequacies of our defence tool, particularly in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, which lose a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuarization?
@edmond: that's what I was saying, look elsewhere where to save money but especially not at home, at home it's really not possible...
That is exactly what you propose to do, look elsewhere where the mismanagement is certain.
Let all those who have been in contact with more or less the military thing dare to come and say here, eye to eye, that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting out laughing ...
Apply the same potion to the entire public service and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really reloud: look at the inflation of public jobs in other ministries and you will understand why La Défense can consider itself a little busy!
Well, yes, the savings on which everyone agrees that they must be made, it must be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls groan at the assassination when it happens to them, the poor darlings.
It should be done but above all that it does not fall on me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How will closing the Val de Grace weaken our defence tool in the Sahel?
As for the local authorities, history repeats itself with each closure of posts, maternity wards, hospitals, barracks.
But everyone is for savings, of course.
It's strange, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and is not happy about the savings made in public spending.
This article is really the most mind-boggling thing I've ever read!
That embarrassing moment when the first three people commenting make the same bad joke.
It's the depression to scroll through your Facebook feed and see that 80% of your friends started their statuses with the phrase "This embarrassing moment".
I think they're going to make a movie out of it.
It will surely be based on hilarious scenes where someone stumbles upon his ex on the bus on his way to work and only realizes that his skirt has tucked into his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely stupid.
Not really, in my opinion the author adopts the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and grit his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to the stage after 25 years of absence was something powerful.
Do you realize that your comment is now in the middle of a battle over who will get the rights?
I don't have the "internet".
So I don't think I can comment.
Not having a computer.
My god, I have to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe what this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read!
Charlie has just demonstrated that he is at the top of the cosmic universe that is satirical journalism!
I fall backwards!
It is imperative that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the enlightenment and discover the incredible brilliance and unsurpassable genius that springs from Mr. Brooker's keyboard like a divine gleam.
Good god, it really sucked.
Especially if they are neither women nor transvestites.
I am a parasite.
This shows a positive evolution within democracies: the rise of regional policies and effective associative initiatives.
Until further notice we are being confiscated the right to save our planet by states that play the tartuffes at every meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, citizens, to take matters into our own hands.
With the commissioner they planted to energy, all these beautiful recommendations have vanished ....
Translate: Wind turbines and solar farms are the roundabouts of tomorrow.
All financed by the con- coreable.
Please stop this pro-nuclear rhetoric.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the entire sector is not mastered, it is better to limit oneself to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided of course that we drastically reduce our consumption.
Electricity through renewable energy to fight against CO2 emissions?
The France is not concerned at all.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions at production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity through renewable wind or PV is already more GHGs on the other stages and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for the intermittency.
Replacing nuclear with renewable wind or PV would run counter to the fight against CO2.
Christial I do not insult you I am Doctor of State in physical sciences 1981 more I did research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the contrary of what I said.
For what I did not say it is you who lend me ideas I said nothing about Germany nothing in fact you did not respond to what I said and like all right-wing people demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I also quote the conclusion of experts commissioned by the German government: Germany's current renewable energy program is an uneconomical and ineffective way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you do not count uranium mining and construction and if you do not count the water vapor greenhouse gases of lesser effect than CO2 it is true recall that two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant goes into water vapor and a little in river water.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a "giant of South Asia"...!!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
It doesn't surprise me, most Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India a giant of South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but to have a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a Pandora's box full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for ISL, today's opening match was surprisingly interesting, with Athletico Kolkata winning 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions India spends on IPL cricket and now football, how could we ever compete with our "noisy neighbours"...
The race for the low-cost launcher is paid for in cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect only manifests itself with too cold helium.
So we may not be in a design defect, but in implementation...
Unlike Arianespace, which is a private company, it seems that Soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer.
They may pay for the satellites in frigates who knows.
This is all the more unfortunate since many media outlets repeat only article titles in a loop - and that many readers retain only these titles.
All in all this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Totally agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly questions the project when it is only a launcher problem.
