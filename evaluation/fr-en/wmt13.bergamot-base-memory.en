Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
Republican lawyers have only documented 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments enacted new laws from 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon has grown after the November 2010 elections, which saw 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in the year of 2011 alone.
New election laws require voters to present a photo ID card and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce advance voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day and remove their right to vote from citizens with a judicial record.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first state to make such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana's law in 2008.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have been sponsoring bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11 percent of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required ID card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than US$35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
Much more.
Students, voters considered to vote more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID cards issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use to vote the cards issued by these clubs.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voting.
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers sponsored laws in 2011 abolishing voter registration on election day in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped to register approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the enrolment rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the advance voting period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-American, while the latter accounted for only 13 percent of the state’s voters.
The same was true with Hispanics.
These accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In return, whites that made up 76% of voters accounted for only 46% of voters voting in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have vigorously opposed the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The U.S. Advocate General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have enacted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undeniably make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and see it as a clear goal of influencing the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Centre shows that the states that passed these laws account for 171 of the 270 votes required by the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have significant impacts on the result of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Screening for prostate cancer: taking the test or not?
Indeed, the PSA test would sometimes present erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This is enough to make men already reluctant to take screening tests even more reluctant.
Take the test or not?
We have asked two experts for the opinion.
In studies in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, this one, which concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had screening and those who did not.
This study also demonstrated, with follow-up after 12 years, that we have between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if we are not screened.
So I recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if you have a direct parent who has ever had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once you detect cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
The patient must really understand the degree of risk of his cancer, by offering him the possible options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect life in the long term, and by opting, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who are detected of cancer will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We'll suggest that they do active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we'll offer them treatment.
Increasingly, criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated are being determined accurately.
I would recommend taking the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not we should pass it.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting good lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from them.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked anymore, this rate would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Many also remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
This is very detrimental to people’s health.
"Again today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer drops by half.
The weight
Overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer,” it added.
Food
The organization also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity, it increases the risk of having colorectal cancer.
Charcuteries too, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“The latter can damage the body’s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” it said.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is inconclusive at the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC.
While one of them saw a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established either.
Furthermore, M. Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of talking about his worries and his family history with his doctor.
"Passing a screening test, it doesn't give cancer."
The shelled Higgs boson
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson created a whole stir last summer, and for good reason.
It is indeed believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, just that.
And then, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we hold an authentic new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, but there is still a lack of data to be perfectly certain.
Let's still suppose that it is the Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem slim, and let's see what it is.
There is, in this world, a fatally unavoidable law that two things cannot end up in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
However, even if particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consistent roughly in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In a corner is good citizens named fermions, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And in the other are agitated the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can indeed be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not address here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature spread and to which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
These bosons, we must emphasize here, are not all creatures as exotic as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field in this precise place, much like a pebble thrown in a pond.
From this "disturbance" an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore, one of the "force-carrying" bosons.
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, except that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to reach very, very high energies, a little as if it were a frozen pond of which only a very large rock could ride the surface.
That is why it takes a huge particle accelerator like that of CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring 27 km in circumference! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
It is not all particles or materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself on a fridge.
And in the same way, it is not all particles that interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the others (like the photon, hold) do not have one.
Now, what can "bring" all this research, asks Ms. Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any discrepancies between observations and predictions of the MS.
They are also several to long for it to be found, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physique" and plug some holes of the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, proposing no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-oops!).
But we haven't found such deviations at CERN so far.
Repercussions
The repercussions of this research in the daily life of Monsieur and Madame Tout-le-Monde are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will not be.
Here: In the early 60’s, the pioneers of the laser, in Bell Laboratories, did not suspect the revolution that their work would trigger.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have already told fire the physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 -, initially the laser was rather seen as a "lab gadget".
Imagine...
And then, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work in optics.
This sensor, although it was not at all its original intention, now serves as an "eye" for all the digital cameras in the world, and earned it the 2009 Physics Nobel.
This, of course, does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, you never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die... | Duty
With its Commission to die with dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate is to resume shortly as a bill prepares.
However, in this essential area, much remains to be done.
Le Devoir tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was eating him had left him a two-year respite.
"They had given me five years to live, I was seven years old," he said, half-fig half-grape, lying in bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care house in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, you can’t be prepared for that,” he said.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents it from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even manages to smile, speaks to strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medicine, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is that I'm being cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he said.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"During our life, we learn that a man, it pisses up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at home Victor-Gadbois.
Regressing to the child's stage, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“It depends on the person’s ability” to accept regression, he notes.
Because, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments are taking place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the Victor-Gadbois hospice all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life prognosis of three months.
At this point, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides so-called "curative" care.
For 89-year-old A., the worst fear is to die "conscious and suffocated".
But the disease made me discover my children.
“I have good children,” she added.
“I don’t have any more wishes in life,” she says, before accepting that she is being put on a mask to help her breathe.
She is still waiting, in the coming days, for a last visit from her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, we provide, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
It is palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11 700 inhabitants.
It's very little when you know that you all end up dying one day.
Here, life goes on in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the home’s doctors.
Whether in terms of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
At the dying, we will agree to provide mouth care with the brandy or the Pepsi, according to the request.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, died during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help loved ones as much as patients,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the house Victor-Gadbois, the days follow each other but do not resemble each other.
Alongside a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last family assembly in the courtyard, well-wedded in his pillows while being toasted in his honor, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children, after trying everything to survive.
“For six months, there have always been three to five beds that are occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the house Victor-Gadbois arrive from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the terminal phase of his or her life, whether at home, in hospital or in nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Maison Victor-Gadbois and the Société de soins palliatifs à domicile du Grand Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec health care that raises fears among several doctors specializing in palliative care the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care luminaries including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, is circulating to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not performing well enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before we agree to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency room, in great pain, without being done to relieve her.
I'm afraid that patients will only ask to die because they don't receive adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are relentless on their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Hélène Richard's survival expectations were already minimal when she gave up hard-working chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she said.
Still, she told me I was finished!
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank caregivers for not having granted their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Société de soins palliatifs à domicile du Grand Montréal, patients are resistant to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which amounts to sleeping the patient until the time of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of the suffering.
More and more, the unrelieved patient will have the possibility to have this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die. "
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to euthanize me,” it means “I want to be relieved.”
The report was made possible through a Canadian Institutes of Health Research journalism award.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road, construction contractors, political party fundraisers and specialists of the Italian mafia tell day after day what they know of a formidable "system", combining building industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
An "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers a lot, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It's curious how the system has crumbled since we took the big means," says Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec City and former chief of police of Montreal.
It was through him that the scandal broke in 2011, through a thorough investigation into the wrongdoings related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the then Liberal Prime Minister, Jean Charest, had only agreed backwards.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, hidden party financing and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he points out, the only transport ministry would have saved a billion dollars on contracts," some curbing their instincts to receive a share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he added, hoping that it would manage to "demonstrate the schemes behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also working with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
The more the police officers of the "Marteau Squad" who, since 2009, have reportedly led the "cartel of the sewers" of Montreal to put the soft pedal on the swelling of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and charged fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly pocketing bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Montreal street engineers and Italian-born entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, are formally accused.
The latter caused a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who paid the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
M. Zambito sowed to all winds in the 2000s, giving more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power.
He also had organized an illegal fundraising for the former vice-prime Liberal minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts whose costs he inflated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
Gilles Surprenant, former public works engineer, detailed it well in front of the commission: in ten years, he received gift construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totaling 736 000 dollars, in exchange for sewer contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other road officials have confessed to having been greased with their feet by inflating the bills from 30% to 40%, by fake extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay for deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget feeding his crates with dirty money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected officials in Montreal to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the borough of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she revolts in 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought 5 million dollars and sold... 1.6 million to developers, in full real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be put in place, she says that she "shoots a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pin the attacks".
The process, she says, is “painful but positive.”
We are cleaning the wound but we would need a survey unit specific to Montreal and a watch, not to see questionable practices return.
Just like we do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "elected officials aware of the scheme", when they were not soaking in the magouille!
Estimating at 70% the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he ironically: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to 100 dollars but that will not change the situation, according to him: "As long as we do not strictly limit election expenses, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a complete revision of the system of public contracting and party financing: "We cannot go any further; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will make it possible to rebuild the house on a more solid foundation, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in their own backyard...
“PSG is not FC Barcelona!”
This season, you have taken on a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
This can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I progress by their side.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And in the game, it's easier.
Everything is going very fast in football.
But I'm not igniting.
From my beginnings to the pre-formation center of INF Clairefontaine to my visit to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced in stages.
So you take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's rookies are used to playing very high-level games.
They also know that every training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my positioning.
He is supported by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect in all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with fancy clubs.
He has been around great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
I was coming out of a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my performance.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the place of leader.
But we're in ambush.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th finals with the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we will have a say in the face of very good European teams.
We want to finish first of our pool, in front of Porto, to be able to receive during the 8th final return.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and to register in the long term.
Today, that is not the case.
Financially, the PSG is giving itself the means for this project to materialize.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to pocket this title of champion.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, had an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It's normal that we're expected a lot from ourselves given what's been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
Afterwards, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to blame us, it's definitely a little frustrating.
We wonder what more people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built with time.
We proved in the Champions League that we could answer present.
Look at Manchester City who has not managed, for two seasons, to qualify for the 8th finals, they have also made huge expenses!
In view of the sums invested, we imagined you with 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can smile by telling ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up winning.
PSG seem totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better we say there's a "Zlatan dependency."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and puts a lot of goals.
He came for it and he proves that he is the star of Ligue 1.
He demonstrated wherever he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did is truly exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grabbing playing time.
I saw things there and came out strengthened.
Today, I manage to achieve good matches in selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
The lessons were learned from what happened in Ukraine and we must now have exemplary behaviour.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
Like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good draw (1-1) snatched in Spain on October 16 a founding match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without the banks
The opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of peer-to-peer files.
About 200 000 transactions have already been recorded thanks to 15 000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars, five months later, before returning today around ten dollars (the prices are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world exchanges in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to progress in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But, each time, a central authority controls and processes exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are both custodians of the account book, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two email addresses like an email.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged exist in the public account book, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It involves solving a mathematical challenge to computers, and whose winner, a kind of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a file hash phase, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and more unique digital footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "chopping" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all the other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, to defraud, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaned because both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to the one hundred millionth, which leaves margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also met with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
“The flaw used is not about the protocol itself,” said Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also mentions the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
Cash also has this defect.
Heavyweight actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "giant balances" were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, believes a lot in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus come back cheaper.
The wearer also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
They just need to communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
“It will take time for Bitcoin to win, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, which are now considered high, if this currency succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
It is mainly the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign armed presence, as in the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes helped by the local insurgents, they will no longer be so when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was made in order.
Convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles joined Kabul without being attacked, overflown by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban surge on Kabul at the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country with fire and blood due to the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price of obscurantism for these peasants overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former mujahedeen, Afghan government and present-day Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They turned into businessmen, seizing government land to sell them to building land to refugees who returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They discredited themselves; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of the American largesse: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have rubbed shoulders with the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they have appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, government schools are full of girls and boys alike.
It will be necessary to provide work for these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All of them, including armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish soap operas that present a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that command it be considered legitimate?
Former Soviet-fighting commanders are already concerned with the re-enactment of provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially in the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has, since the 50's and already long before, dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been restarted, no dams are in condition, no significant irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor has spread that Afghanistan has immense mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that Westerners were only there to seize it.
Without energy to process iron or copper ore on site, nor means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to search the huge Buddhist site and remain the province’s largest employers.
It will also take a day for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which large imports and exports depend, to re-establish normal ratios.
The departure of the French fighting troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school for girls, boys, department of French at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and to carry out the impossible task of matching aid and offensive actions, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, carried out, and carried out by a small French NGO, many works of collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, greedy in local manpower, were able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, protection of soils and increase in cultivable areas.
What will we leave as a souvenir, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much smaller budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2 000 metres.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurgency carried out by foreign groups, which farmers have told me to wish, a small, well-controlled and directly affecting civil aid should be maintained in their favour.
A Constitution at the Force in Egypt
This is a new poker shot from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants him full powers, he has decided to play his all-out.
Taking everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given this House two more months to finish its work.
Egypt has almost been relying on a provisional text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased the divide in the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "betray his word" and "trample on the law".
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within two weeks.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to renounce their plan to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while protest is raging throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favorably, as he claimed in an interview with the US weekly Time.
Especially since this recourse to a hasty vote is due to the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, or I keep the full powers", these supposedly to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, with a large Islamist majority, voted the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were missing.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, believing that they had not been able to make their opinions.
The same had been done by representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, replacement members, were added in a hurry, yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, it was most often unanimously that the articles were voted on.
Commentators have also had fun with the fact that one of the only differences of the day has been expressed around... the time of prayer, some members of the committee believing that the clock of the constituent was poorly settled.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, contains 234 articles.
Objects of all attention, Article 2 finally remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law."
The Salafi parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major demand, hoped to be able to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed for stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," the Liberals respond, who only see a communication coup.
Because according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They relate in particular to Article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying the conformity of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of a theocracy.”
The Liberals' fears are further fueled by the fact that the next president of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"At the moment, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulema but academics, for some trained in the French system," tempers Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be ambiguity around Article 220, because the terms used borrow from religious vocabulary.
It refers to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic case law, ed.].
And the question in the future could arise as to what extent civilian judges are competent to rule on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another contentious point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the Defence Budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will the trial of civilians be banned in military courts, as requested by human rights associations.
The latter also express their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially of the press.
In addition, no article echoes the protection of women, says Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, holy sites, the Center of the World and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and a wilderness.
Argoumenty i Fakty has retained five great reasons to visit Israel.
Go and love the holy places
Unavoidable rendezvous: the banks of the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who penetrates these "baptismal backgrounds" will be touched by the divine Grace.
As for the Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he soothed the storm or where the fishing was miraculous.
It was at this very place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
Believers travel the Rue de la Suffrance or the Way of the Cross (in Latin: the Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the courtroom), where the trial was held, then led by the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to that of the Stone of the Anointing and the burial.
This is where the Christian center of the world is located, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to Christian legend, the Monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wailing Wall that constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC. J-C.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave small words accompanied by prayers that are then answered.
Travel high
Visit the ruins of the Massada fortress, an ancient refuge from enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC. J-C. for his family.
These ruins are found on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can go there on their own.
For the others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1 600 and 2 040 m above sea level, is the ski resort of Mont Hermont which welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
Old beliefs want pagan gods to once inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country is home to nearly 300 museums.
It is impossible to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting that are really worth a visit.
First: the Israel Museum near the Knesset (the parliament).
It houses the very ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
Also worth seeing is the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
We mainly exhibit the paintings of the Impressionists and the expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of casts from visitors and supervisors of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are prohibited.
The Fifth Museum is the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum or Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into total darkness.
Stars are sparkling.
You hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
Israel's three major resorts are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, because the temperature of the water does not drop below 21 ° while that of the air can reach 23 °.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point of the Earth, 417 m below sea level.
The azure-colored water contains brine and retains the bathers very easily, even those who do not know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are of surreal beauty.
We come to carry out a treatment based on salt water, silt, healing muds and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of antiquity
They are guarded by the old town of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and that Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived here a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk through the narrow alleys that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the street walls corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds who have come to do photo shoots from all over Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk in the Roman theater, "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Note to tourists
If you are leaving for Israel, do not worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer dollars to the euro, because they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
As for urban transport, these are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only subway line in the country, consisting of six stations and capable of connecting the lower and upper parts of the city.
It is almost an underground funicular.
The journey through all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition is to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturdays, markets, shops and public transport cease their activity.
And the work week begins on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes made up of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also hummus, traditional Jewish dough, different sauces, balls of ground chickpeas, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that walk around the haughty air.
You can see them sleeping on the rooftops of parked cars.
These felines love passing places and do not refuse to be feasted.
The rental of a car varies according to the brand from $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The language of numbers
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists went to the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Who language has, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists are controversial about what the mandatory language testing law will give, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already appeared in the country
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are Central Asian nationals: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to earn money to help their families staying at home.
Since 1st December, a law has entered into force and stipulates that every migrant worker will have to pass a Russian examination.
At this time, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, personal services and retail sector.
However, over time, promises the Federal Migration Service, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
It will be necessary to validate his language skills in Russian to obtain and renew his work permit.
Nationals of countries where Russian has official language status are exempt only.
Persons who have obtained teaching certificates or diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not affected by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centers will be under the aegis of the Russian Language Institute Pushkin, the University of Peoples' Friendship, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to take the exams in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce reviews was supported by the State Duma's deputies and the Federal Migration Service.
But, before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what will that give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, respond the representatives of the migration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering "from slavery at work".
Many talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, says the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "trip" to an overcrowded house where he and dozens of his fellows will torment themselves for months without food and paperless and will have to work between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"At home, we promise them one thing, and when they arrive, we cheat them, we take their passport, and they do not receive the expected salary," confirms the Head of the Directorate of Migration Services for the work of the migration service of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, Mr. Policeman!
However, many nationals of the Central Asian republics who wish to come and make money in Russia say that they do not only know the language of the country they wish to travel to, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is of course not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow even a fair primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have enough to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equipping them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people go to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It’s hard when you don’t know the language, they say.
"You feel diminished and diminished."
Human rights defenders, however, note an important aspect of the language law.
The examinations will be intended only for migrants who have legal status.
Without status, there will be no examination or official work thereafter.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or defense to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 ruble miles.
And then, one can get a false recording quickly for only 1 500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we have no recording, hence the cases of extortion.
"They ask us for 100, 200 rubles, something to buy cigarettes, tea," Umed Khushkadamov, a Tajikistan national, told reporters.
"Be quick, don't skimp and buy yourself a beautiful work of art"
From the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was discovered that the registration documents of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
The falsified papers come out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: every migrant who hoped to make the task of the examinations easier had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Power representatives and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "pieces of paper".
The authorities can give to migrant workers who have not been able to validate the exam the first time to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not handle the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very small
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against civilian gunholders.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it is the shootings made during the weddings or the killing organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who left seven dead.
Police want to ban the carrying of rubber guns in public places and raise the legal age of obtaining a gun licence by increasing it from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Security and Anti-Corruption Committee, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the Weapons Act would be introduced in the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "squeezing the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demand to abandon "this senseless hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC, told the Russian service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from sourcing from the black market.
According to them, we can find today in Moscow any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior says it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black market of weapons is supplied via several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served ten years in the Ministry of Education and Headquarters.
Screenshot from a site taking arms orders
The first is "the military trace", that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military operations in the Caucasus.
“These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians,” Baranets said.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals from law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both the weapons stolen from the police stockpiles and those stolen directly from the law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of these have often been blown up.
“Attested versions indicate that some fires were deliberately started to conceal the deficit,” the former soldier said.
For Baranets, the weapons manufacturers are for something.
"We see private weapons factories that do not compete with competition in the international market and flow weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," said an expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A significant proportion of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyz.
"There is a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organizes the supply," adds the former soldier.
Where did the guns come from?
The experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the subject was compiled in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Specialists analysed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from the weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, comes from the military and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons on the black market found themselves there "because of the fault of employees whose work is related to weapons", the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from the scene of military conflicts, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from "smuggled eddies".
A salesman and consultant of an armory who has asked to remain anonymous assures that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these specialists of the clandestine search; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, the sellers go to look for the new goods in military warehouses.
The person purchases a unit through a sign, such as a TT gun.
We give it to him by passing the goods through a fence.
"He transports her to the city and sells it for €900 per unit with two chargers," he says.
“It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so when crimes are about to be solved, they make a purchase of control from illegal arms dealers,” the seller added.
" Like in a luxury shop "
The seller and the buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy came forward and offered to come to Begovaya station where someone was getting me to a "corner" to bargain.
The price of the gun, I was given it on the spot
Victor Baranets as Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust them.
There are sellers on the markets, but there you have to come too saying for example "On the part of such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter has lost a tooth".
Now I even buy a pair of American fists using someone I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't give it away.
Newcomers look for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990's when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The schemes, he said, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "everything we want".
“I thought I was in a luxury boutique,” the soldier recalls.
There is no secret to the buyer, says Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don't just buy, we go with the seller in the forest and we set up a target.
"I'm being let fire and when I'm convinced that the gun is working well, we start negotiating," the expert said.
A shop from his couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, we do not need any document and no one to meet.
"It is enough to have a precise amount of money," writes in advertising on the site "Buy a gun or a fighting machine gun".
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we sell to the minors?
"Without a permit, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (spelling preserved).
"Buy TT. Moscow, writes "Fedorenkov" in its very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has released a huge network of fake sites and picks up people who want to buy combat weapons.
People flock to food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia

I have heard of these types of schemes: usually, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take the lead.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains the secretary of the association "Right to a weapon", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, you can find yourself unarmed and behind bars.

A Makarov for 100 dollars
The purchase of an illegal firearm, experts say, can cost between 100 and 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "Right to a weapon", one can buy a Makarov pistol for 100-300 dollars.
It will take about a month and a half.
It came out of the long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official data from the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of these crimes in Russia overall has fallen by 7% and amounting to 22.9 miles while the proven cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs has fallen by 7.8%.
U.S. employees of fast food and supermarkets are on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through a cashier job at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has mounted against the low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will grow or run out of steam quickly.
These actions are supported by the trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
Along with the increase in modest wages received by grassroots employees at Walmart and in fast-food chains, the organizers of the events want to get the creation of unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", when a surge of sales seizing millions of people fell on America and sometimes triggering esclanders.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their posts to organize picket lines with unions and left-wing activists in the company’s stores whose products are intended for consumers in the modest and middle classes.
Walmart markets everything from layers to shotguns to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why a lot of poorly paid employees at Walmart go shopping only at their workplace.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products especially because of the low salaries of its employees.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or handheld scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" protests were asking for a pay raise, they complained that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who receives $9.5 per hour, this is an amount he can not afford.
Scientists at the California University of Berkley show that if Walmart raised the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost the group 3.2 billion dollars.
That’s 1.1% more of what it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred all wage increases to the shoulders of consumers, every race in the store would be up to them at 46 cents more.
They will spend in a year only 12.39 dollars more than they do now.
Walmart supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in just nine states and did not harm the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in stores from 8am in the evening to midnight the next day and Walmart sold 5000 items per second over this period.
Its caisses have made a total of 100 million transactions for the "Black Friday".
Company spokesman Dan Fogleman said in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post that in all "less than five" Walmart employees had left their posts and that the protest was only a "com's operation among many others" by the organizing union.
"Next customer!"
The protests continued this week in New York and also concerned Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, which is why they are not yet established) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces to sell billions of servings and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job you did honestly!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage provided for by federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food is increasing them over time, but by little, on average, its core employees are reaching $8.90 an hour in New York.
No one touches any less than them in this town.
For me it's inconceivable to live with this money in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live with this salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum there are comments that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you are going to feed them with.
Protesters who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that fast-food cashiers and cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, a multiplication of more than twice as much as the current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of trade unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing it and punishing protesters in a union with bullying or layoffs.
However, administration rarely simplifies their life.
For a union, seizing fast food is still a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary rotation of the staff.
They disagree
Other tumultuous demonstrations were held near several of the other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the mid-day rally near Times Square’s McDonald’s with the intervention of several local Democratic politicians, including that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: “McDonald’s announces selling billions of portions and then they don’t even give you sick leave and don’t pay you the work you did honestly!”
The protesters were backed by other New York Democrats in sight, including the candidate for mayor Bill De Blasio who said that "we all need to support fast food workers to get a fair salary and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized the event as the most important that the fast-food industry has seen in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, not all were fast food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is difficult for the moment to say whether this spark of mass movement will make small.
"At the moment, we can only moderately deceive the brain"
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to perceiving augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google that unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it is clear from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group of the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are already ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time trying to widen the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained for the moment on pixels on flat screen and sometimes touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead of us and guess the radical changes that will happen with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox sells today without Kinect because everyone is interested in ordering through gesture.
- What does the future hold for us too?
Although Kinect has made the interaction physical, a lot of things happen on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The capture of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for now, not really.
We try to change that and we are working on truly 3D imaging systems running on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We must bring the computer world out into ours, into the physical world, to make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Thus, we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And for starters, let’s get rid of these stupid virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think about voice command?
She is appreciated, but is she not overrated?
We cannot say that this is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because we do not always want to inform others of his actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to control the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet worn by hand that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- I mean, I mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this can?
You would do it with the word and with the gestures.
- Usually I only talk.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So, you want to force users to adapt according to what the machine can or may not do at a given time?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify the reactions of man.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what don't you like about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we rely in our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, it adds work to the algorithm designers.
It is necessary to keep in mind the resolution along the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s are really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond gave the touchdown of the sensors a regular processing delay of between 1 and 100 μs, the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device of this type in my work, but not requiring touch, to have more frames per second.
- But shouldn't we increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a usual sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a soft product similar to Kinect, play with the curve of the cameras and see how this could help define the locations.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn’t present its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that from a point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the platforms with the most perspectives?
- Of course, walking around all the time with a smartphone hands up is not practical but here is what I think: the best option would be an "transitional" augmented reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch from glasses to the smartphone.
Glasses are a very personal device and this is what makes their strength (personal elements are the ones you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple mortal.
There is a problem that opponents of this idea point to: there is no tactile sensation!
The hands feel nothing!
What responses does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image support.
She records the pressures perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really intended to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example the interference of several ultrasound rays directed to a precise point where the finger is located and which gives you the sensation, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the tips of the fingers.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a working axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Make him believe that he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
There is still a task down there on which it will be a long time to go to harm each other for a long time: the way to make someone believe that is physically in a very small space that he walks in an almost infinite open space - we work on the concepts of treadmills (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For the moment, we can only moderately deceive the brain, there are still many years of work.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting to the researcher: a lot is still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The Petersbourg avant-garde" dedicated to urban dwellers who are in advance, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already hosted prominent actors from the St. Petersburg art scene whose achievements go beyond the city’s border and who have found recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extroverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed in red that can be seen near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in the trendy parties and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always bring together the crowds, regardless of their exhibition space.
He is one of the fundamentally social and philosophical Petersburg storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980's and early 1990's.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took in his hands an organ of Barbary and he became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role because of his existence, his philosophy and his image as a bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you travel the city all in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a designer specialized in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not grey arouses aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize that you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my work was located.
I realized that this was my way.
Then the wave of the unofficial old painters had passed and the new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood.
I began to befriend the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchchina which gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
- And all this ended up in your art clinic... - It was important for me to be at the center of St. Petersburg culture where the best creative forces must come together.
In 1995, I took place in Pushkinskaya-10 which housed before the works a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the bohemian Petersburg.
Many were born: The NAME, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy songs in the playback in tight-fitting jerseys, they were among them Igor Vdovin, a now fashionable composer.
When the band started performing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg animated a lot of shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his training and basic education, it was at home that he received them.
Galerie "D137", Club "Griboïedov": these are repercussions of the Art Clinic.
Our employees went there as regulars.
I am a hero of the last century, of the time when culture wanted to say something.
In 2000, a poll was held in the press: this was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named "Painter of the Year", and that's when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, one can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong news and acuity.
I'm going to have an exhibition scheduled "The Russian Museum through the Clowns".
The clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it's scary to be like that.
But with the clowns, everything fades, the tragic fall.
I like the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory disguise.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we should spit in his face.
And the lie will be erased by disguise.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the barbaric organ player. - A cultural city must have this type of hero.
Who else but me can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can be beautiful too?
- Today commercial art must be neat, delicate, sweet.
A disintegration of culture is occurring.
Before, people were divided into herds, the followers of the bohemian loved one thing, the nasks another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollars ticket to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- These are people we threw away who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and at the end of the day it is less management, money, everything withers away.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to cheat on them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually the ones that are painted at the end of life.
Ideas are often confused today.
They say: there is spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the civil servant of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the reign of the good tsars, it was not like that, the Tsars did not understand the culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who might be experts, but they are ruled out, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and make their way.
Currently, it is the "reign of taste" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for it.
And on our stones, art is having trouble growing.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
With us, this layer is very thin.
We have to make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange
Give birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Caravans of space shuttles with earthlings on board go in search of a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how to continue to make our species live in weightlessness or on a planet of relief?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, if only by hypothesis.
“This is Venus and Mars,” said Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. State Astronomical Institute. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500.
You can only live at a very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to look at the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differentiate in any way from the varieties of the earth.
Then, we put into orbit insects, small reproductive drosophila flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo developed in weightlessness.
A completely normal chick is obtained at the outlet.
Then the problems begin.
“The problem is that the chick has to find a support, he has to get on his feet and start moving,” says Vladimir Sychev, director of the laboratory at the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP).
By finding no support, the chicks were stirred in a disorderly manner.
And after 10 hours, newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chicks did not react to the light or the sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
“We squatted their eyes twice, then we gave up, because it’s just impossible to work with them there,” says Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature arch" with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, biosatellite "Bion" will only carry species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetus into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"It was still about biosatellites and then it's the only experience. We must carry out this kind of research, "remarks Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
Nevertheless, reproductions are not yet achieved directly in space.
This is no small matter.
By losing their usual background, animals are no longer able to achieve their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, man is capable of it, in principle.
Homo sapiens possesses abstract thought, it is capable of creating a suitable emotional background.
This type of experiment is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been going into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is the most precious thing humanity has.
Our seagull flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold after a space flight.
If she could have given birth to a child after the theft.
“No one was answering this question,” says Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, a retired rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just a year after her theft in space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolayev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been twice in orbit and having even worked in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
“And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during the flights in orbit,” concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology laboratory of the Cosmonauts Preparation Center: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero buoyancy, cosmonauts train in extra-vehicular outputs.
Water imitates weightlessness.
If for adults, water is comfortable but nevertheless a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
The little amphibious men seem to confirm it: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
Since the baby evolves about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of his mother's womb, it is easier for him to get used to the water.
This is in principle logical, because from his birth to his first bath, it takes place only 2 weeks.
“It’s very little to forget,” says infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born the weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the belly, of the pelvis atrophy very quickly, the baby's ability to push is lost.
Okay, let's not know that by relying on the delivery simulators.
We can of course prepare a birth in a special room, the woman will be able to get him out.
"What next?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite you to reflect on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If it does not feel the earthly attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscular system.
You can’t dress an infant like an adult with a special combination for workouts.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a disabled child, fully disadapted," said Igor Pestov, director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medico-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The birth of children in space is still theory.
However, in time it will become a reality, when the Earthlings travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their space-born offspring.
The head of the ISC (Higher Institution for Public Finance Control) said: "the control of the pseudo-self-employment (in Czech "Švarc system") failed because of the politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it lags behind in terms of its implementation.
This was stated by Miloslav Kala, Vice President of the Supreme Audit Institution for Public Finance in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that’s what is missing from us,” Kala said in her commentary on the current situation.
A joint check by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of the "Švarc system" by Petr Nečas.
Prime Minister recently stated that the SDO is not going to bother contractors with controls, so is it allowed or banned?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent the action of an authority responsible for going to inspect to demand compliance with the law," Kala said.
At the meeting of the committee of control in the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a Czecho-German project in which the public procurement legislation of these two countries was compared.
What was the question of concretely?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation and a practice itself follow.
We have put all this together and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "more strict and of better quality", nevertheless, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This therefore confirms that it is not sufficient to develop increasingly detailed rules on continuous development, but that it is necessary to devote oneself to the very implementation of the law.
How can this project help you concretely and what happens to you?
A common control of this kind should precisely contribute to our effort to clarify the laws, to lower and improve the thresholds, when it does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the market thresholds, we will not necessarily reach this goal.
It could be that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork, that those who seek the flaws will find many more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems concerning the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our SAI or a different mode of organization?
With regard to the institutions, similarly to the SAI, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized similarly, there is also a council constituted a little differently, but these two institutions proceed fundamentally in a similar way .
The competences are also, to a certain extent, similar, with a nuance however in relation to our system: Germany being a federal structure, it therefore also has courses of accounts of this type at the level of the different Länder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which corresponds to the resources of the state.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities are there, checked at the level of the Länder's account prices.
When it comes to national legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model, but it cannot be said that it is doing better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better detectives?
No, probably not, but I repeat, I do not have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we consider to be a model, is also facing a whole range of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage in cooperating with our institution, right?
With regard to national legislation, what has been meant to you, as an institution, by the amendment of the Public Procurement Act, is its effects already being felt?
Since this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it does not yet have an impact on our control operations.
As we do ex post checks, we must count with a certain delay.
Our observations concern only, for the moment, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument for "detecting the risks of mismanagement" with which we have screened nearly 14 000 public contracts - these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been modified as well as the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an additional burden on the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope the future will confirm that.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become stricter and it is not possible to respect them.
Already under the previous regulation, the provider (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced the controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the market law signified a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really helpful to make the law tougher in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who make formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
What is the solution to get out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the SDO would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent the action of an authority responsible for going to inspect and require compliance with the law.
He can say, “We’re going to change the law and allow it,” but he can’t say we’re going to act like nothing has happened.
The Markets Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be completed, precisely in order to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that a tenderer should be eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that is, in my opinion, what is lacking in us.
The roads are frozen in frozen places, but most remain passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snowy.
However, the network remains largely passable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the area of Karlovy Vary, the roads were passable this morning, but in frozen and also snowy places.
Temperatures have dropped and oscillate between -5 ° and -10 ° C but they should rise slightly in the day.
The snowfall has ceased in the region and only a thin layer of snow remains in the plains.
The ridges of the Metal Mountains (Krušné hory) are however covered with about 30 centimeters of snow.
Data from the Regional Road Maintenance Service indicated that due to fog, visibility was reduced in places.
The R6 expressway and the region's national roads are now without difficulty.
However, vigilance remains to be placed, for example on certain bridges whose coating can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third category lanes, including mountain roads, are also passable.
There are still on some of their stretches of frozen snow and in places compacted by traffic.
Especially in the areas located at altitude, drivers must increase their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králove
The Roads and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some roads in East Bohemia are threatened by the formation of ice and that traffic-packed layers of snow may be found on roads in mountainous areas and located at altitude.
Road maintenance services warn drivers against the risk of ice formation in the high-altitude areas of the Pardubice region.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on departmental and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
Snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a traffic-packed layer of snow is present on the roads in the high-altitude areas.
In Eastern Bohemia, the weather will be dry today, most often clear, with possible cloudy passages.
It will blow a weak wind and temperatures will usually oscillate between -3 ° and + 1 ° C.
Pilsen Region
The roads of the Pilsen region are now passable, although, in places, it is necessary to be more vigilant and to adapt its driving to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures oscillate between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the last snowfall and the cooling that followed, some communication routes can be in frozen places.
Drivers can expect to cross fog areas, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is reflected in the information of the Regional Road Maintenance Service.
The D5 motorway is almost without difficulties, but road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between kilometres 80 and 131.
The siding of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the South Pilsen district and in the Tashov district.
The departmental and third category tracks are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on the less frequented roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers travelling to areas of the Alemouc region located at altitude must today count with a thick and soft layer of snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the so-called "Červenohorské sedlo" pass and on the road to Videlský kříž, after chemical treatment operations.
Snowfall forced road maintenance personnel to go to the field last night; according to road services, more than three centimeters fell in the Šumperk district.
In other parts of the region, most pavements can be passed without difficulties.
"On the heights of the district of Šumperk are snow remnants.
Drivers travelling towards Jeseník should expect to meet at the so-called "Červenohorské sedlo" pass a layer of thick and soft snow," the head of the Šumperk district road maintenance services told ČTK today.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník district also visited the site during the night; according to them, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are passable without difficulty, in the district of Šternberk drivers should, however, pay attention in the sections in forest areas with roads that have remained wet.
Regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
As of this morning, North Bohemia Road Maintenance Services reported several difficult sections.
Police data show that in addition to some areas covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, and therefore snow and ice should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially southeast of the Central Plateau of Bohemia, there is, on the contrary, no problem and the roads are usually dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of ice, particularly in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snowmelt during the day, clear skies and frost during the night.
From the main traffic routes, difficult conditions on national road 13 on the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec are also reported.
The closure of traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that have curved under the weight of snow until it reaches the roadway.
Šimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy. "
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
It's just one of those alarming news stories, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, we laugh rather and we think that we are the only group able to collect a positive energy remnant in order to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, you are putting together in December a very unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project to our readers in more detail?
This is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the potential marketing of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11 a.m.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end practically when the Mayan calendar on the island of Kiribati that is in the Pacific Ocean ends, on a time zone up 12 hours from us.
Who had this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, to reflect on the state of the world we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap with other performers also recorded a hymn against the end of the world called "End of the World Cancelled" (in Czech "Konec světa zrušeno").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will we also hear it during these charity concerts?
Of course, at the very end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in all three concerts.
The anthems will also meet at some point as part of a live, quite unique, show of Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also plays the main role of Jesus in the music video, Xindl X also sings...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show-biz, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charity events...
We strive to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What will the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world be used for?
To equip the Studeo training center which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we work to carry out within the framework of the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap association, and this for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedličkův Institute and offer them activities that interest and entertain them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Several music groups and performers will take to the stage during each of these concerts?
By what criteria do you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program that is aimed at all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will be on stage.
You can find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time as part of the Prague Spring; there too, we will surely prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year in the House of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once there in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not that bad that it looks at first.
We have five members in electric chairs whose machines have to travel in the hold, of course we also carry a lot of luggage and instrument boxes....
So far everything has gone more or less always well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we came back from recently, everything went without problems.
Thanks to your travels abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of public opinion towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have justly witnessed in Moscow that in the east all is still in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for a person to move alone in an electric chair in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider it obvious to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is being created.
How do we still have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are many things we are still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and developments are always dependent on the efforts of those involved.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a severe disability to move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, the museum, anywhere...
It is still not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather on the contrary at the forefront of progress!
Public respect and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers.
For the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this band?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.
And since I am a musician myself (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, we lost a little control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in recent years, if I'm not mistaken?
That's right, creating connections with well-known singers and actively working to promote the band helped us.
We understood that if a job is not visible, it is as if it does not exist in the background.
Thanks to the subsidies of the European Union, we can also allow ourselves to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was potential to change things.
Show business is full of stuff that copies each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
Few are the original projects, and I dare to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, whom we must take pity on.
They are people who can live a life in their own right and flourish, provided they have the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities manage to achieve something, it is not only a step forward for them but for the whole society.
Isn’t your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many areas and require some discipline.
But I think it's perfectly normal.
Some people come to our house with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take the preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the roads for the concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap Group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
Only one, Láďa Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and go, we can't help it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case the day before the planned day of the end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba Arena, in Brno in Fléda and Ostrava at the Plynojem with the participation of twelve bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when the song of The Tap Tap "Fin du monde canceled" will be sung jointly.
The aim of the concert is to gather financial resources (up to 25 million CZK) to equip the Studeo multifunctional training centre in Prague in the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years, the pre-sale of tickets is open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency countries, Poland was admitted as a twentieth member of this agency, it is the second member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started a close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in the years that followed participated in a number of the Agency's projects.
However, the road from Poland to space began much earlier.
Already before the Second World War, passionate Poles were working on spaceflight; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his avant-garde work entitled "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the listeners cold and years later Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his book "Introduction to Astronautics".
The said Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote numerous books on this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a propagator of world-renowned astronautics, his contribution was rewarded in particular by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the far side of the Moon.
In 1925, a draisine was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, we do not know the author or the details of this project.
It is also unclear whether the rocket should be used to propel or brake the draisine.
The only known information about this draisine is that of the press of the time.
From 1933, Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
The documents retained show that this research had reached the stage of testing.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search stopped.
In 1937, the plans of a photoelectric fighter rocket, drawn by the engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects had the purpose of military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all plans to use the rocket technique were carried out by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all work.
This committee had been created in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other work on aeronautics was published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish astronautic society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, there is talk of a company in the November 1954 issue of the newspaper Problem, in which are found four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to astronautics
By this time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research was looking future.
In early 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the International Astronautical Federation (created in 1951) and by the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He retained his office until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) meteorological rocket, which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version, RM-1A was built and, in the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket were initiated in the Bledov Desert.
This rocket was 1.4 meters long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should have been capable of carrying out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have had a range of up to 14.5 km and used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962-1965, succeeded the first RM-type rockets.
This rocket, designed with two stages, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space with a volume of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C by 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these types of machinery was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this program.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
This decision has raised a strong discussion in public opinion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to examine this issue from a broader point of view.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means concretely that the different economic entities as well as the national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of freedom of trade and the (limitless) free movement of private capital combined with unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the price of labour (salaries) generate a strain on prices.
The following meaning should be put to this end: a producer shall strive by importing goods sold low-on-take to resist economic competition by "making the competitor's price more expensive", with the aim of removing a greater share of the market and thus increasing its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad, or buy at low prices, or disappear. The result is significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the State's social charges necessarily increase.
All this situation intensifies the perfect bad will of gentlemen entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social damage caused to the whole of society by this race for profit.
This situation is so publicly aware that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital generate in the various economies a situation in which the governments of the different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to their homes.
In other words, governments are putting their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking into account social collapse.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to the laws in force.
The objective is to force economically its own population to accept the dictates of the prices of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This is done on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and on the other hand by restricting the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.
The result is increasing poverty and deepening the differences between the rich and the poor.
In the FRA, there have been public food distribution points for the poor for years who cannot support themselves with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is becoming quite common for employees to receive such wages that the state is forced to pay extra to reach the subsistence minimum.
For example, such a scandal has been uncovered in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of virtually all the southern Member States of the EU undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) or to live with wages of misery, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their country.
The question is: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will pass from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to all of Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media claim, on getting tired of it, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the directed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence and, even, does not direct today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same, the entire state.
The answer to this question is definitely yes.
The proof of this is that there is a lobby that is virtually all-powerful and present in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In the FRG, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the development of bills to law firms closely related to industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
The totality of power does not come from the people, as the Western-style constitutions declare, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberalism-oriented democracies are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Time of Caesar and Pompey": "The state had long been in full decay and the functions were attributed by violence.
Bribery, illegal favors, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The under-tables and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with votes already sold. ... "Honest people did not seek office at all, it resulted once the state stayed 8 months without consuls." “We were really beginning to say that the remedy for this difficult situation was an autocracy and that we had to choose an energetic man.” It is true that Appianos had Pompey in mind, but it was Caesar who irreversibly turned democracy into an absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, today's society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard to the interest of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and assert the interests of society as a whole.
The result is, today as it was in the past, a decadence without precedent of the elites, without any effort to carry out far-reaching reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
As things stand, the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal democracies can be considered a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, the humanitarian and social crises that we are witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity as we know them through ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at international and internal European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution is socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investment in the economy, increase citizens' influence on government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing will ever come out of the violence and never will be able to," Sting said in the song titled Fragile, whose main verse of the chorus is "let's not forget how fragile we are."
“If my sons didn’t want wars, there wouldn’t be,” Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild’s wife, told her deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have been raised.
Some take the side of Israel, arguing for its right to self-defense and placing Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to reflect on who is guilty and who is the victim, in his waves of recurring killings; after all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the Autonomous Territories, were born in this political situation and have not experienced the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view located "behind the curtain", on the one who mainly benefits from the tensions that have already persisted for more than 95 years (from the Balfour declaration in 1917) in a small piece of Middle Eastern countries.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available under consideration, others emerge from my own understanding of that, or more precisely of the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the story of a struggle for power.
At each time, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individualities acted independently or whether they owed their actions to the throne to someone who directed their actions according to previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we live in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers could not be achieved in a single generation.
Among the families with an astronomical wealth is particularly different from the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude it).
Few are written about them.
Of course.
Since the 90s of the 19th century, they acquired the first world news agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts in which they were involved and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their wealth or both.
They have major stakes in almost most of the world's central banks and prepare or wage wars against countries in which they do not yet have such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries were 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4, meanwhile Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who has tried to stand against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of a central bank at the Bank of America of the Rothschilds and began to issue his own money (government, I hear well) during the Civil War and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
JFK began to issue clean money and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to file a lawsuit against the Fed for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the world level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated to the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The objective of the first war was to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to suppress colonialism, especially British, and the third should reduce the world's population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the beginning of such a solution) and, in the end, acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with the Rothschilds at their head is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following the chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the Fed intended to prevent the failure of crises like those they provoked in 1907) to repeat themselves.
After having succeeded in starting the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir Habsburg to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War abruptly ended with a German surrender without economic and military justifications (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers allowed the politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: they imposed, on the one hand, on Germany, staggering war reparations thus generating the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished masses (it then only takes them to place a sufficiently energetic leader, pointing to the finger of the culprits, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechosshe did) a fifth column to set fire to the powders and start a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschields inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration laid the groundwork for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers originally held him; or if everything he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of World War II, the founding of the State of Israel has lit a fire that could cause a third world war.
If international bankers manage to start this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but internationally (just see how people are bitterly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is a victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong begets another wrong according to a circle of endless violence and where we find, at the origin of everything, the greed of certain individuals and their desire to acquire power over the whole world?
We must make the difference here between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, like at home, international bankers offer people in elections only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything in order to start a war with Iran, which could, because of the accession of this country to the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) expand to become a global war and, given that Iran controls the strait of Hormuz through which the strait of OrmuzA destruction of the world economy.
Under what light now appear the comments made by David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of finance aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth an electronic chip making him a totally controlled being.
Let them compel all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to wear on the hand or forehead a red iron mark, so that he can neither buy nor sell the one who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood: that the one who has common sense counts the numbers of this ferocious beast.
This number designates man and it is six hundred and sixty six."
The movie Argo: When everything goes to the worst, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protesters made up of Islamist students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the US administration a positive outcome, it could not, indeed, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, a blow further aggravated later by the fiasco of the attempt to release the hostages by force.
The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following the negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate in the United States sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The Iranian debacle contributed heavily to Jimmy Carter’s defeat to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered America a small victory.
Just before she was busy, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated adventures, they found themselves in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In collaboration with Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran with an incredible cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a film crew who came to make scouting for the shooting of a film with a great science fiction show.
Combination of genders
Exfiltration expert Tony Mendez's plan requires Hollywood collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magazines reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of many genres.
It is on the one hand a political thriller designed in a realistic way but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful blow, of a treachery - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen.
The atmospheres follow one another: sequences of Tehran of documentary style (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and the way in which, thanks to these photos, these same situations were transcribed in the film, there are no big differences),
lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
From a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his acting stopped arousing ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark policeman "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It is also Affleck's first film that doesn't take place in his hometown of Boston.
The sense of atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed his first films above the Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where Tehran's role "is held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity which also suggests confusion and unpredictability occurring when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the fake film crew in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to settle for a subject offering in fact few thrilling scenes, in the cinematic sense of the word.
It does very well, it sometimes adds some elements to reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is ruled out by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the airstrip is quite far-fetched).
Argo's weakness lies in its dispelled character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood cooperators, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from it, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a little dramatic tension, he lets himself be seen with moderate interest, enjoying the realization and retro style of the 70's.
It trains the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story still, in a way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he does the trick.
Rules to inflate balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public inquiry into the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the contest of the rules or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is planning, in recent times, to adopt a quota of 40 percent of women for the management of the big European companies has been at the origin of our decision," said Patrik Nacher, organizer of this survey.
Among the nonsense mentioned is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, however, women were advantaged in terms of life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can point out until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of the "EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations is, for example, the obligation to add organic components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the prohibition on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of cages of chickens, which has led to the increase in the price of eggs.
Criticisms have also been made in the past against the de facto ban on the use of the phrase "butter spread" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters in size.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or a group of states (for example the Czech Republic is currently imposing the demands of its banks by threatening to use its veto power).
The interests of the pressure groups are also, for example, at the origin of the fact that in the Union, bananas must not be of a size of less than 14 cm or have an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission has defended itself by arguing that it is only harmonising non-homogeneous national standards that complicate trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite opposition from some states, claiming that existing guidelines lead to food waste.
The first prize may be awarded in this survey to last year's EU regulation that a warning must be on inflatable balloons indicating that children under 8 years of age should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to a US investigation that balloons are, among toys, the leading cause of child death by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 when it comes to blowing in fair trumpets.
We have strange ideas in our house, too.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme for Greece, anyone with an official function in the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must, instead, speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Laissez Faire" bringing together liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com has appointed in this survey, in addition to some of the above mentioned absurdities, the Union regulation concerning the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that could be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day we joined the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and therefore faced a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey considered interesting the idea of paying money to certain countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy to apply for the granting of subsidies.
However, these ideas are not from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact of not having a sea handicaps us.
We will ask the European Union for a refund." In the autumn of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture at the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) spoke.
He argued that, because of our wheat production, and as a result of the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the state had found itself with full stocks that it had then had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
Ultimately, the European Commission responded positively to Czech demand and organised a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for grants were proposed to municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which were intended, in practice, to write applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU says: "Weird regulations are rare."
While regulations often give rise to criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union and its overall development deserve praise.
More serious is, for example, according to experts, the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which were imposed by Member States during the budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, must fight in Brussels for the right to use specific denominations for these traditional products (a struggle from which it does not always emerge victorious) arouses strong emotions among the Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomucké tvarůžky", for the name "Tuzemský rum" which dates back to us in the nineteenth century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only products based on cane sugar alcohol, and not beet sugar, may bear the name of rum.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, today is found in the company of world-famous cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, the massepain of Lübeck or of the parma ham, the biscuits of Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), the carp of Pohořelice and Třeboň ("Pohořelický a Třchmel").
Pardubice's gingerbread ("Pardubický perník") and cakes called "Hořice's Horns" ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Senator, how do we get the idea of running in the presidential election?
It is not to be a senator or president who matters to me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I wouldn't be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer stand to see how the country has been looted for the last twenty years, that thieves are not locked up and taxes and the age of retirement are increasing.
I didn't have the ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, then I try to bring a solution to make it change.
And since I am over forty years old and I am an independent member of any party, I have no other solution to influence the situation than to stand in the presidential or Senate elections.
You entered the Senate but quickly set out for the Castle (N.d.T.: seat of the presidency).
Do you not turn your back on those who elected you?
I have always said that I will engage in the battle for the Castle according to the results of the Senate elections
Subsequently, I made it clear that if I were elected a senator, I would run in the presidential election.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument allowing me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we grate at the bar or in front of our television set, but also that we trample on those who are trying to make change.
To this is added the press which breaks the reputation of people and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I have been told that I bribe the journalists or that I was the advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Now to your visions.
You have begun the struggle for the Castle with the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax declarations beyond twenty million [CZK] as your workhorse.
To this end, you must change the law.
As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I lobbied for the purpose of guiding tourism activities as a liberal profession, I was successful.
The problem is politics: when someone arrives from the left or the right with a good project, it is knowingly refused and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I have a much greater chance of gaining the support of all the parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without partisan categorization and dogma, to take from each side what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you consider yourself a man of the right or the left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people are putting me on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we are moving forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left-wing or right-wing, but to bring people together.
I always support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Do you enrage when someone says you are a populist?
But doesn't what you said prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal purpose and vision.
You're trying to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have talked about it.
But without the support of the parliament, you only have slogans.
You won’t survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my camp in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should then explain why they do not want it.
When there is a strong personality who will identify abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president by direct suffrage, it was obtained thanks to the pressure of public opinion.
I admit, without ambages, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I have just started politics and I am trying to get the majority support for my program.
I'm trying, alone, to move things forward, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's like Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that one person cannot make a difference, which is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to run in the Senate elections as well.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorenová who revealed the oil fraud.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of people did not vote and what did, for the most part, gave their voice to an establishment representative.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that can hardly impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning to start your own party?
No, not yet, because I do not have time to check if the past of each potential member is spotless and then I do not have the financial means.
I also have no money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand in my "transparent" account.
You don't have money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property at about 60 million.
I have in Prague a plot of 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid's dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving, was struggling with women and fighting evil and abuse.
You drive in Aston Martin, you have a wealth worth 60 million and you have no money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I go into debt?
I have already invested 2 and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I do not have any sponsors clearly shows that my program does not attract much interest.
I have no obligation to pay for this campaign out of my pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I could not make a living from it, for example paying for my son's English school which costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I won't run for any election.
So you will continue your commercial activities to be able to live?
Didn't you say you'd mute your activities?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my business.
For example, my deputy will take over the management of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
I have to live on something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.
You will find this interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper Práva.
The architects of the firm MVRDV prove that the real adventures are not only about imagination. To be convinced, it is enough to contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountain of newly erected books - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it's very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist at a large company nearby, tells us: "Yes, it is indeed beautiful, this building".
I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has internet, iPad and e-books.
Today, no one goes voluntarily to one of these cheesy libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory city that is not attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a fairly special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to give some neurons back to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictional bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of pretty small miniatures in painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to get their hands on the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, from the Rotterdam MVRDV architectural firm, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of spirited and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and presented himself to the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a sneer on his face.
And while the members of the jury still looked at each other, bewildered and shrugging their shoulders, Maas, the brazen, stacked his books of choice in order of size to make a pyramid, and finished his speech supported by activist arguments by a "dear common!"
Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain has sprang from the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and some terraced buildings and houses for a total of 50 dwellings.
In early November, the mountain of books was awarded the second "Best Library of NL 2012" award.
The project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, this small dull village, which until today had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a town hall of a mind-boggling ugline, whose white facades invite us to think that they house a dairy, has been enriched with a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in its history.
The long way to reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
Certainly, an elevator transports you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open to you when you tread the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and elegant streetlights unequivocally speak the language of municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for the eyes of public benches, dogs and little boys and girls playing ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally, the library shelves are along the facade and in the middle is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Willy Maas.
We completely disrupted the classical spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain of books has been skillfully arranged: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical power plant of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes panelling, sometimes railings, sometimes stair railings.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even hardened architects and building engineers do not want unknown materials.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
Thus, one day we found in a Frisian agricultural company an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, synthetic membranes have been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and we save time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, and then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane has been compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and transforms into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 meters, the literary café offers us a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and pot ficus.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they contribute above all to maintaining the ideal level of humidity of the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the new soul
"It's incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun only lights up the inside, even on sunny days.
The thick wooden beams mounted across the glass facade serve as a sun visor, intercepting much of the spokes.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
Fully automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic computer scientist, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "finally found soul".
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure made it possible to fill the voids of the library which was not yet fully stocked (today, it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing on all sides.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I believe that our invitation created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has reached the main discipline that is called, in professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history.
Even though she may seem young and poorly educated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role."
Germany chose abstention in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the US and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request to obtain observer state status with the United Nations.
But then she chose abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must exercise caution, as it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think she doesn't support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but did not be too critical of Israel.
During the insurgency in Libya in March 2011, Germany also chose abstention in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Is Germany having difficulty in taking a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy, so to speak, defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union makes the situation difficult.
The Germans therefore face several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe they are still groping to find this role, but are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy, such as in France or Great Britain
What does the term “normal” foreign policy mean specifically for the Germans?
It shows the desire to adopt positions beyond those of the United States and European partners, including national issues.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of the other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position on the conflict in the Middle East and abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany has first of all important opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to offend public opinion, but also the elites of Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a determining factor.
However, I would not give it too much importance, because it is not an exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is in any case a decisive element in German strategic reflections.
Does Germany interfere with its relations with the United States by choosing abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think the Europeans and the Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think that the divide is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will be more respected.
Indeed, Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, the views on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States has announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot of course defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great that they always seem to be so.
If you observe relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing with enthusiasm for Netanyahu’s policy.
Does Germany have difficulty in reconciling its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I think it doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not.
They cannot therefore register within a broader political line and must assert their singular position.
This is what they are currently doing in the issue of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will assume a locomotive role in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been tricky.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role that further marks their independence.
Is Germany playing a strong role on the international stage, does Germany only want to take a key role?
Or does it still have difficulty taking on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still has difficulty playing a greater role.
If we look, for example, at the euro crisis, we notice that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German sentiments are heard.
It doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
She has to deal with very varied neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only diminishing, but at the moment the EU is not filling this void, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant to them and they're just less appreciated, it's life!

‘Brand Protection’ in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection as the company bearing the name of the mark cannot file a complaint.
And even if she could, it's not certain that she would win the case.
“It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer with Taylor Wessing, a property infringement in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
Imitators only need a few more letters to be able to register their trademarks.
So instead of Gucci, we record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copying, such as Puma, the sports goods manufacturer.
Pattloch opens a workbook in which the registrations made with the Beijing Trademark Office are located.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm artificially created by appropriating part of the name Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become world champions of copying and infringement of intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that sell almost only counterfeits.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different: his constituents instruct him to address the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially confers on Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese talk about "Bang Mingpai", a parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan."
It is with this term that women who marry rich men are referred to.
Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," says Pattloch.
"The brand is watered down, the singularity disappears, the damage to the reputation is enormous."
Financial losses and legal costs are in the millions for the sectors concerned, especially with regard to expensive flagship products.
According to data from the market analyst CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third largest global luxury market and the fastest growing market.
However, it is not easy to write down the questionable records from the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reports the trials in which the court dismissed the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name criticized had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarism, because he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also involve graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against construction machine builder Sany, the same company that had just bought the concrete pump producer Putzmeister.
That's why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, the Volvo acquirer, used before a blue and white logo that recalled that of BMW. The conflict was settled and Geely had to change it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost to the plagiarists of Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the look of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO trademark office in Beijing admits to having experienced some difficulties in 2010 because of a lack of staff and space.
However, the office would have gone from an "emergency situation in the course of work to a restored normal" last year.
Thus, the number of untreated opposition proceedings would have fallen by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 proceedings remain outstanding at the Office.
Acting is expensive
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the OCT received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, this is a record and that means that China is at the top for the tenth consecutive time for the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal brands, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office reportedly recorded 1.8 billion yuan of registration fee.
In other words, each record reported an average of 1.280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarism.
Certainly, the Germans were able to obtain that the illegal manufacture of vehicle components be suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain his Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
“It’s our fault, because surnames cannot be protected in Germany,” said Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office had therefore rejected the objection of the Munichers.
Freudenberg has certainly won the case in the two subsequent instances, but the opposing side continues to fight until today.
Vigilance is required
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praises the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: "the procedure is long, challenging and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The archives department even had to review the deeds of the last hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the opposing party a "big sum in six-figure euros" to settle the dispute.
“That’s what we see what it means to us,” Wentzler said.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to spill over to Europe.
This would be the case if imitators from this region were to ensure the exploitation of unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to lay in Germany the name Freudenberg for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it could still have prevented the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "Vigilance is required."
Pattloch and his advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to rely on international trademark law, foreigners should instead "also register in China everything that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much higher than those of the registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay license fees to the opposing party for the use of his own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or we would lose our place in the segment of the market in question.
World AIDS Day: typing, singing, helping
The Imbongi choir repeats in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland are delighted with their arrival.
Here is the story of a link that crosses much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, we tap the foot: cowboy boots, sneakers, pumps for ladies and moccasins for men look for rhythm by hitting the floor of the foot. Very quickly, they find him.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the vocals of the singers slowly amplified - viola, bass, tenor and soprano -, they get carried away, bewitch and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses his canvas shoes when he conducts the orchestra with his wild-flexible gestures.
It's Monday night, Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Fifty singers from 23 to 69 years old came, from the geneticist in human medicine to the man in the home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each singer has different lyrics, all in a very exotic language: the Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Being helped to help yourself
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, estimates that 34 million people around the world have the disease.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per less, you can become a sponsor.
This amount guarantees the child money for the school, a school uniform and a hot daily meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "storyteller" or "singer of praise".
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this area, but all can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the choir has been repeating songs in this foreign language that she brought to Germany to now return it to her home region: the South of Africa.
8.733 kilometres as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest straw or earth huts and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has taken away their parents.
In Esitjeni, the smaller scale of the evils that plague Swaziland can be seen: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population carries the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in the mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village. The Imbongis have mostly seen many children on the street who were not only lacking parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
At first, it was only a few people who personally committed to pay a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has been dealing almost professionally with the AIDS orphans of Esitjeni since then.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and blennorrhage (or gonorrhea).
Common STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
The lice of the pubic and scabies belong to the parasitic ISTs.
Which groups are primarily concerned?
Syphilis and blennorragy often appear in men who have sex with men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men is responsible for at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), blennorrhagia, and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed within this group.
Among youth, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25 years.
Moreover, in Germany, the human papillomavirus is common in young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure has increased from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has declined.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white discharge, lower-abdomen pain as well as the appearance of pimples and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms may decrease the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason for this is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through lubricating infection or through close body contact.
Experts therefore recommend that anyone often changing sexual partners regularly take exams.
Most ISTs quickly screened can be healed and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all to the funds that choristers raise through their voices throughout Germany, the means accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
She also ensures that orphans are well housed, for example at one of their grandmothers.
The gogos, this is what we call the old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them welcome up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and ensure that they go to school every day on time in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is welcomed in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid for by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chicken coops. With the help of the American Health Organization PSI, the association organized an HIV test for many residents.
This is not self-evident, because even if the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A King and his 14 Wives
“AIDS is a real taboo,” says Lennartz, “because it’s a subject that affects sexuality.”
It's quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy in place of democracy.
These state-sanctioned morals, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
There are condoms on every street corner, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh versus flesh."
In order to promote a little cultural exchange, the choirs of Imbongi travel together every two or three years in southern Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that many inhabitants of the tip of the black continent still know from the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with whites singing in African language is a sign of recognition that it not only generates good humor and joy, but sometimes also tears from some formidable border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the choirs visit their referrals.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you'll find light," the people say there.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometers as the crow flies, back to Heidelberg, in front of these choristers who tap their feet in the rehearsal room of the Bergheimer Straße, we also find the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger spacecraft has reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could reach 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published this Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger spacecraft has reported evidence of an ice cover in the planet area permanently plunged into the shadows.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters up to 20 meters.
The water probably comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one is making a connection between water discovery and the hypothesis of a life presence on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other elements essential to life have arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the people of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, like small interstices through which the infinite is observed.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets in our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the term 2006 International Astronomical Union.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of the countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "newborn" in the delivery room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where the stars, called "W5", are born, a very unromantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
NASA's Spitzer Telescope photographed the flamboyant glow of a dying star.
The donut-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the huge Trifide Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades, a cluster of stars also called "the seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope puts the colors more in value.
In this infrared photo, the Helix Nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is located 700 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
His similarities to a terrestrial continent earned him the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photography allows to observe a spectacular shade.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigmas of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble Telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
Depending on the shade, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three dust trails divide the glowing heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic pile-up in the constellation of the Serpentary: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two molten galaxies rush towards each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble Telescope has observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "Souther Firewheel".
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and is made up of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than common household dust.
This photo was developed from the optical and radiographic shots taken by different telescopes.
You can see the circle composed of black holes that is 430 million light-years from Earth.
The Space Telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars on our Milky Way.
The celestial cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are connected by the Rosette Nebula, also permanently create young stars with 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and pierced with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists believe it was born soon after the bigbang, when the universe was made up largely of hydrogen.
Our look at the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale Telescope at Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest telescope.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It makes it possible to observe the universe through two mirrors each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, in the Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa has been segmented to save money.
The diameter still reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its particularity is its great capacity for collecting light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capability is similar to those of the world’s largest mirrored telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of alien signals using the radio telescope of Arecibo (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help with the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") by using the computing power of their machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, an installation worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will consist of nearly 1,000 elements of mirrors.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck’s telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory that observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new gigantic telescope is also expected to be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to admire it.
However, the most important space images come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been giving us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 planets candidate since the mission began.
This photo illustrates the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space at the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope’s mission will be to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that Mercury’s South Pole is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, because Messenger orbits much closer to Mercury's North Pole.
The radar data had been indicating the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain.
Drink butter daily, and live to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the Patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the Patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97.
The trip to the Talysh Mountains is a disguised romanticism.
At the bend of the many turning points of the road, the small bus bumps along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, it would almost feel like in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group named Talysh, about which little is known, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and have a very great longevity.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town is plastering with its overly aggressive Soviet-era architecture that does not agree at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one lane.
The province has not yet taken advantage of the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place.
“Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision contest, and next year, there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world here,” Fatulayeva said.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
You can discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh in the region that are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he turned 120.
Have a child at 136
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have turned 168.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when we think that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man married three times and he had 23 children. By the age of 136, he would have designed a girl again.
Did Şirali Müslümov have been wrong by a few decades when calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the man in the old age of Central Asia.
“Surprinty elderly people also live in parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” Scholz says, “in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old.”
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence because of the non-existence of the documents, not to mention that there was no civil status register.
Every day a glass of melted butter
It is nevertheless in fact that the people of the region of Lerik often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it is a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the high-calorie meals of the Talysh, which love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for your health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves people’s youth? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With her 97 years, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a chick, whose contents she tirelessly beats.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two small children also roam in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical belly-shaped armadus glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under his scarf hide long braids of a dark blonde that his son proudly reveals to us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost it and kept their color.
“I’ve never used shampoo,” Mirzayeva adds.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my life, I've never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took command.
The language of propaganda amazes in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the father figure of the nation, a man who ruled his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham later succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manats (about the same amount as in euros) for his retirement, a sum that guarantees a good lifestyle in the region.
And perhaps the long-glossing son of Mirzayeva is right: "the elders enjoy great respect in our culture."
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
"Human rights" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Rival protests reveal the country’s deep divide.
The draft constitution based on Sharia law is violently controversial.
The Egyptian president is not stingy with words full of emotions.
We must make the transition a success.
“And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God,” he told state television.
His speech was intended for the whole people, but also especially for the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
Because all the confused and desperately disunited members of the opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, temporarily restricting the constitutional court’s jurisdiction and expanding his own “in order to save the revolution.”
However, the Egyptians and the world don’t really know what this 61-year-old engineer wants to save, a PhD from the American University of Southern California.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles hastily written by the predominantly Islamic constituent assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour night tour de force are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that the case law is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
It was and still remains a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists will use the vague formulation and the resulting legal room for legal leeway to apply a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
In any case, it is that suggests a newly introduced article stating that, with regard to all subjects relating to Sharia law, al-Azhar University must be consulted. The establishment is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its brightness shines on the entire Sunni Islamic world.
This can, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative apparatus, which would de facto lead to the placing under the guardianship of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts worked to suppress opponents.
After the dictator fell, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The state must also, it reads, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the formulation is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of cinematographic art and literature.
Clearly, it would simply be censorship.
Furthermore, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
However, the article does not define what an offense is or how it should be punished.
Equally doubtful is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "offend people".
Is it enough to draw a cartoon of the president or tell a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the draft that Morsi submits to the vote and which, in his own words, will be "very soon" the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The revolution is reborn"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
On Friday night, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual match in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, promising to bring down the Sharia before it came into effect.
“The revolution is reborn and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said the draft constitution is "to be thrown in the trash cans of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to foment a “putsch against democracy.”
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and we will overthrow him," said Jasser Said, an opponent.
“We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet expiated,” said Khaled Ali, a politician and opposition member.
In addition, several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
"The Quran is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim brotherhood called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of Cairo University.
The veiled women and the supporters of the Salafists, who participated in large numbers, chanted: "the people demand the application of the law of God."
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, claiming that "the Quran [was their] Constitution."
A fight for sovereignty over the symbolic Tharir Square, where everything began, would soon have created a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that's what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said opponents of the draft Constitution, like its supporters, had spoken out loud and clear.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the ballot box the direction the country must take.
The project of the Islamists will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process that should have extended until February and encompassed all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their conception of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That's why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
“And now the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution,” he said during his meeting with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are a glaring attack on the rules of democracy and will generate a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto strips him of all his powers," Saeda said.
Yet a democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, who look at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could pay for.
A protester in Tharir Square warns, "You give birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
Norway's rakfisk: Is it the world's most fragrant fish?
The five million people in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the appetite of the locals for an extremely fragrant fish?
Get some advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a stack of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway’s most popular dishes.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, permeates the air.
Rakfisk consists of salt-sprinkled trout and fermented in water for a period of time - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When the darkness settles down and it is cold, the Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
“You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit,” says Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter who is also known as “Rakfisk General,” head of festival management.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and put on a large amount of drink.
“Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk,” Havard adds.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid passing it under your nose, it’s not bad – it’s reminiscent of a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
Rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in airtight water barrels, and then salted in the autumn.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - without a doubt with the senses diminished by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, emigrating mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted to full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital, though fragrant, element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a little pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you € 10 each.
Norway does not often make its word on in international news, which is not to displease it.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who shot 77 people, including women and children.
When they mention this killing, they talk about the "incident of July 22".
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that in their peaceful country, one of their own may have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970’s, Norway has owed its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason that justifies our success," says Anna, our waitress, with blonde hair and the eyes of a piercing blue, the image of Nordic well-being, with a tray of rakfisk in hand.
We are - how do you say - cautious people.
His English, like that of most of the people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - all, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries threw money out of the windows, in the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep the strings of its purse tight.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
“Not to mention the rakfisk,” she added in a carefree laugh.
I stand under the snow and queue to buy myself something to eat - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a burger composed of momentum, a real discovery, it's excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I stay in is one of the many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most fragrant of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a butterfly knot, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It's like the Eurovision contest.
"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You can hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of the fish emanations.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto is having a difficult start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant of the BBC is interested in the difficulties that await him and the expectations of the people, which are numerous.
Road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal times, a security checkpoint has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the goal was not to prevent people from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico's economy is doing well, from the results we owe to outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
“My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Mr. said. Pena Nieto to U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before rubbing shoulders with the US President, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.
A very populated and sprawling state that encloses the capital. On his favorite land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic commune of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The premises attribute to him the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new highways of M Pena Nieto, a significant improvement has been made to these roads, once bumpy and full of crevices.
Plaques bearing his name hang outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We are counting on him to implement lasting change,” said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the congress and party of Mr. Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy in particular, we hope for a real change that our country so badly needs.
After 81 unfailing years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party concerning Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticism of opponents who blame the new president for lack of charisma.
He is a whole, very committed man, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image of the people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more glaring.
Hidden under the highways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called to the rescue to fight against the drug gangs in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a disaster area, the bodies of dozens of women murdered over the past two years have been found on the edge of the landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place infamous for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
The critics of M. Pena Nieto, say that at best, he failed to stem the problem of murders perpetrated against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see reality in the face.
In a concrete house, typical of this dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me photos of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version mentions a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived home, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says the Señora Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the cadaveric rigidity was already underway.
While her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross where the word is featured: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, a troubled crab, a whining woman.
They want us to accept what they say and shut up.
“But it’s not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,” she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives her scarf on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has made a promise that he will make it his priority during his term.
“I hope he will be as good as he was as president as he was when he was governor,” Olvera told Congressman Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning has not complained of ill-treatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of abuse that Bradley Manning was allegedly subjected to during the detention.
The trial is about Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to close the case on the grounds that Manning's kidnapping was in extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to demonstrate Friday that Private Bradley Manning — accused of being behind the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the U.S. military — has missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein claimed that records of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months in detention at Quantico, Virginia, did not reveal any complaints about his treatment.
Cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a motion requiring that the Manning case be closed on the basis that the kidnapping was in very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place a day after Manning testified to his desire to commit suicide while in detention.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At Friday's hearing, Fein discussed with Manning the forms that the officers had completed after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in the military prison in Quantico, where he was subjected to maximum prison solitary confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein mentioned the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment of his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had had in the prison was generally "very professional."
The forms do not include any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning responded that he had orally expressed concerns about some of the issues and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would address them, but they did not document the issues raised.
“They wrote ‘no problem’ (after addressing the concerns), and yet, that didn’t mean I didn’t raise any issues,” Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment in a January 2011 interview with the special commission that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The military said they assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for his protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the staff to know that I was okay, and I wanted to be removed from this status... in order to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he considered committing suicide while in Kuwait and fainted once because of the heat.
He added that the fact that he was not kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage,” Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell — at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours — without a company.
Manning also added that the only objects he had were a mattress, blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
He tried to stay in motion, because sleeping or lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning also said that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's January 2011 treatment.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked overnight in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other detainees one morning, during the call.
Manning testified that at no time was it allowed him to cover himself with a blanket during the call.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he had inferred from the order of his guard that he had to let go of his cover that could have hidden his nakedness, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to let go.
Manning testified Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the night before, as he allegedly tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his briefs or flip-flops to hurt himself, but that he had not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops, and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will consider the experiences he had during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he were to be convicted in court martial, a trial that is expected to be held early next year.
The defense said Manning plans to plead guilty to the least serious offenses and fight for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors arguing that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning has been incarcerated in accordance with the regulations that govern the conditions of detention of all detainees at Quantico.
Charges against Manning include the theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of national defence information.
If all charges are held, he is liable to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says that the Mexico-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
During a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, in front of the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two lanes: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("Overthen").
I stood still for several seconds, not knowing which line to point me.
I grew up in central California, where I've been called the "Mexican" my whole life.
This is an ethnic qualifier, just like the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves "Irish," or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italian."
Then I became "Mexico-American."
But here it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that saw my grandfather born, no need for a special qualifier or a hyphen.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle an interview in either language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an indigenous, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and headed to the "Foreign" line.
I thought about that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risking themselves in the United States.
He wants to join forces with the United States and Canada, and create a Union for Trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto pledges to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided further details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give in writing half of their territory at the tip of the rifle.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and no minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes any criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear - in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how the Americans are undermining the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the one the country has with the more than 35 million Mexico-Americans living in the United States.
You want us to address the subject of bitterness?
There are many.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason why the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at one point, in our family tree, a person, maybe a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than not, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- a dark, poorly educated skin, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we are currently living the American dream, that we have gone to good schools and we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that this is the American dream we are living, not that of Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our loyalty is obvious.
We give it to the United States.
On the other hand, we know that a part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not love us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they limp us as if we were individuals of inferior strain and not enough Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we wouldn't find ourselves stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who emigrated legally to the United States while she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexico-Americans, because Mexicans are more firmly claiming their identity and Mexico-Americans are upset about it.
Although she is a U.S. citizen, she feels she is a member of two countries.
On the other hand, many Mexico-Americans I know do not feel like they are part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexico-Americans to work as makeshift ambassadors for Mexico, representing his interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our fellow Americans that Mexico is a superb country that must absolutely be visited and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering the wage inequality, corruption and drug-related violence that are pervasive, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to manage on your own, amigos.
That's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexico-Americans still want them the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Can there never be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is in vain.
While the same futile arguments for who began, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has made everything shatter, and whether we like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Maybe their struggle will intensify a little more.
Yet there is every reason to think that it could help them out of this deadly impasse.
A war that makes no losers or winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Even though the ceasefire granted on November 21 is continuing, this week’s fighting has strengthened the force’s supporters on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will pride themselves on forcing the Israelis to abandon, even though Gaza has suffered a beating.
Killing some of its leaders and repressing Gaza’s 1.7 million people in one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas could say that time is their ally.
The influence of the Islamists in the Arab world is growing stronger, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a booming regional power, once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken up the cause for Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Hamas operatives are glowing and say that the growing Islamist is bending around Israel, from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah militia is exercising its domination, through Syria, where Islamist-tensive rebels can overthrow Bashar Al-Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And the most important, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood is cousins of Hamas, and their leaders rely more easily on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor who can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of Israel’s hard line will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been rebounded.
The missile interception system called Iron Dome proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep in both their ears - for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have criticized Hamas for being at the origin of the latest wave of violence.
But above all, Israel has prospered, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who has totally ignored the peace process.
Although the firing of rockets from Gaza has killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared suicide bombings, including through the separation barrier that encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and that protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality under international law.
M. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has merged with an even more warmongering party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, has the beautiful part.
Why pamper these damn Palestinians by giving them a state?
If they were running the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they come out their heads.
Perhaps the hard-lined supporters will prevail; but the Arab Spring may be a game changer.
Even if Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
Israel's defense budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbors together.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to arrange their economies.
M. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire which bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is destined to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel – much like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are exacerbating this problem as the Arab population grows.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to sound Hamas will have a diplomatic price.
Both sides need to be pushed by those from the outside.
The answer remains that advocated by the reasonable people found on either side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a surrender of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
A hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will provide an opportunity for outsiders to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now address the end of the flow of weapons to Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal of a pseudo-state to the United Nations.
M. Obama also has every interest in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back at the White House, he seems just as reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for neutral cigarette packs have come into effect in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand
This law that came into effect in Australia is a world first, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrible photos of sick organs and depictions of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by the smoking of their parents.
Apart from the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small print on all packages.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government has said the goal is to deter young people from smoking by removing any glamorous representations.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start.
“Even when they’re very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobaccomakers through their brand image,” federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek said, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children were pairing the crown with a logo with a princess.
Even though Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has lobbied against this law.
Tobacco manufacturers have said this will boost the black market trade, which will make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
“Pedicable consequences will arise from this legislation,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
The counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said the law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said the demand for cigarette cases, including silicone cases to mask horrible packaging, has risen sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost to Australia's high court.
Ha said that Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is waiting for stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only trouble, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the segment of the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV commercials, sports sponsorship and the requirement for retailers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned web advertising by local companies and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
“If you work in tobacco marketing and you only have a small showcase to promote your products, the Internet is the must-see place par excellence,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman has noticed an increase in contributions from some average citizens in favor of brands on social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves if this is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has taken the trouble to make a video, or if it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focusing on the new regulations in force rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions – these countries have told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be taken in the course of 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries over similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Stricter laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I ignore them.
“You take a cigarette and put the package away,” Victor El Hage said when you bought a package that features a photo of a tumor in your mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I'll make me stop is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack Tobacconist" in central Sydney, said the uniformity of the packaging made it difficult to store packages on the shelves.
"Before, I needed an hour to unload a package, now I need four hours," Yu said.
"The government only had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it's okay, we stop and we put the key under the door," he added, raising our arms to heaven.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane was having mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I had enough time to think about the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport to wait for a flight is boring enough, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and experts specializing in child development praise boredom.
It’s perfectly normal for us – and our children – to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, or even nurture creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
Then should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yes. Yes.
And no.
But I'll come back to that.
First of all, like many people, I thought that boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But that’s not the case, says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of “Boredom: A Lively History” (Yale University Press, 2011).
“The boredom goes back a long way,” he said.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, John D said. Eastwood, Associate Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After going through numerous publications and submitting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that consists in "wanting to do something, but without succeeding in getting into a satisfactory activity."
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task although he would like it.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of the boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a gloomy mood and the feeling that time is slowly passing."
Boredom can look like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while both can be linked, people who are bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think that we are bored when it is actually a problem of concentration.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experiment in which participants listened on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the next room, the too loud sound of a TV show that had no reports, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said they got more bored than the other two bands - they had trouble concentrating, but didn't know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you’re trying to focus on a difficult or catchy task, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, Mark J said. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study's authors.
On the other hand, when you perform a boring task, “like watching objects on a editing line, music can help you not get bored.”
In fact, he says, now we know that when we squirm or scribble, these gestures, often considered signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to wriggle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay unmoved,” said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or another - the delay of my flight, a speaker with a single-hind voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Scale of Predisposition to Boredom" in the 80's.
The scale includes claims like, “Among the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous,” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have time to do everything.”
Using such a scale, researchers have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida, and in particular need many and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly jaded.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he reached close to 400 teens and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of teenagers reported being bored at school and during their homework, while 23 per cent said they were bored when they were not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents reported getting bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether today’s boredom percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that “adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest level,” not least because children and teenagers don’t have much control over what they want to do.
If I take my question: is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
In contrast, many philosophers and writers talk about a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
“Boredom is the way the brain has found to let you know that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at the N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn’t always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use that energy to play the guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long run.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't have learned to take care of himself or self-adjust, says Professor Fenske.
And “this self-regulation goes from one situation to another,” he said.
Your child doesn’t just learn to have fun, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify the boredom.
Just like I don’t think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside of the constant bubbling that activities generate and technology is the goal we should strive for.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this.
“We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens a sharp, frantic desire to be connected to something that makes sense,” he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy downtime.
“In an environment where we’re constantly hyperstimulated,” he added, “it’s hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops.”
In Colorado, no directive for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a university student and a football player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana pellets and a pipe used to smoke them.
M. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and a few friends were in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and material that could be used for its use - minor offenses, each with a fine of $100 - and a date of appearance.
“We are treated like criminals,” Mr. said Orozco.
But is there one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the Colorado vote to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than the law.
Here and in Washington state, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana have been classified without follow-up.
Police services have stopped charging adults 21 years of age or older for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will come into effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative ridings have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to indict those who own them.
Meanwhile, several cities in the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-owned marijuana-owned businesses in their neighborhoods.
“Things are changing so quickly that I don’t know what the future holds for us,” said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief of Aurora, east of Denver.
Washington state regulators are also asking themselves a lot of questions.
They are seeking guidance on how to install a licensing system, authorizing the production, manufacture, distribution and sale - by the December 1, 2013 deadline.
They say that Colorado, whether we like it or not, is ahead of most states when it comes to marijuana regulation, first of all regarding use for therapeutic purposes and now with respect to personal use.
“Colodaro has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator,” Brian E said. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Mr. admits. Smith, can't do more than suggest what works.
“There is no real precedent that we could base ourselves on,” he said.
Washington’s law, which is called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a one-year legal vacuum, during which the licensing system still won’t exist, while possession of marijuana will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical questions remain: how to balance the state’s mandate that guarantees appropriate access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales businesses within a 30 km radius around a school, park, playground or crèche.
“There will be no more challenging locations than urban areas to set up a licensed cannabis sales business, especially in Seattle’s metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson for the Cannabis Legalization Center, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, the chief of police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an email to his officers announcing that the "City attorney" (representative of the public prosecutor) would no longer prosecute people 21 years of age and older who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police had to stop indicting people for this type of crime "with immediate effect."
Chief Oates said the police would enforce the new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that he would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, the "district attorney", Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession business, mainly in order to pressure users to get detoxified.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possessing 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to further charges.
“Our office has an obligation to prosecute those people who have committed a crime that, at the time of the facts, was a recognized offence,” said Mr. Buck.
The reactions were complicated even in rural areas like Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for restricted marijuana use.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer make adults appear for possession of restricted quantities.
The county’s prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supported the decision, but also decided not to immediately classify all marijuana detention cases.
“I don’t feel like I’m wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters have supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and government framework for the personal use of marijuana is not easy.
And the conflicting reactions that have been observed in different American cities highlight the profound ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
“This is a cultural barrier” with prosecutors, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana use and speaks as a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
“They spent a good part of their lives suing people who were using marijuana, so they have trouble accepting that it was legal,” he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana use at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on their way to becoming a case law case for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are planning a new legalized sales frontier, they are anxiously awaiting the guidelines of the federal government, which still views the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates for the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients on medical marijuana and vendors, the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana sales businesses to practice in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it’s true that the police are unlikely to break down the doors to grab small bags of drugs, it’s a safe bet that it opposes licensed retailers selling personal marijuana authorized by the new laws, Kevin A said. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado have not waited for federal authorities to act.
Long before the votes, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales businesses, even if it was just a one-year deferral.
Last week, the city of Montrose secured a 6-month moratorium, and is expected to impose this ban next week.
“We don’t want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then find ourselves facing a federal problem,” said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
Many questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was abused and excluded from Oxford, because I was a "Tory" (Conservative).
It is not only the students of today who are attacked for their opinions.
For as long as I can remember, I've always dreamed of entering the University of Oxford.
My father and older brother studied in what was for me a prominent place of knowledge, a kind of modern-day Greek amphitheatre that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after moving to Worcester College in the late 80's to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were bewildered.
The newspaper of L'Evening Standard claimed that I had left this university, because I had objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room next to mine.
The author A. N. Wilson stated with facety that I had left after being forced to drink in chipped cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I fled because I had been the victim of intimidation and was subjected to constant bullying.
Not because of my rather outrageous name, or because of the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for a single reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential counsel to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why talk about that today, you might say.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of centre-right students are experiencing the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalised hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week some of them demanded protection of their rights, along with those of gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
The conservative members of Corpus Christi College’s Student Hall (JCR) said they were “often isolated, personally attacked and felt undesirable” because of their political views.
They want a representative on the University Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their views can be freely expressed.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent BBC Two documentary "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", dedicated to student politics, which portrayed the "Tories" as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
In particular, we discovered the student Joe Cooke, former president of the "Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA)", who moves in Rolls-Royce, wears a silver-powered complete and moves with a chrome-headed cane.
At other universities, conservative students say they are being treated as scapegoats for setting up the tuition increase.
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the "Nottingham University Conservative Association," told a Sunday newspaper "that there is a growing left-wing bias in universities.
People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who moved a motion for more protection, says such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OUCA, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are center-right.
“This is a barrier to the freedom of intellectual debates, as well as the well-being of members,” she said.
I was the only one who thought like that in my first weeks spent in Oxford.
I entered September 1986, I was then 18 years old and a paralyzing timidity.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted to refuse to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was loaded with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students got to know the others and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen afterwards.
I discovered that teachers not only participated in sarcasm towards Tory students, but that in addition, they took pleasure in it.
It was as if politics about the striking miners, the privatization and the government's opposition to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa were etched in the woods of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm of which I was a victim concerned a translation into the English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my footing.
Pitt, a little man with a pustulous face, was easily carried away.
"Are the Thatcherists refusing to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears were burning my eyes.
“I suggest you take French classes in your free time – well, if you’re not too busy making friends,” he said.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student of English language studies, named James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said, kindly.
I'm afraid it's that way.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (Conservative) is targeted.
It's hard enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most young Tory claim to be Labour (Labour).
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything that Mrs. Thatcher had said.
This scheme failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political and economic science who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
Other students have taken up the chorus.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, don't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
Could I have only lived a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after dark?
Should I have become Labour and denied my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who was teaching at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his adherence to the Marxist-deterministic point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he said.
I started to commute between Oxford and my parents' home in London, finding refuge with my family and friends with more open-minded city friends.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and explained why.
He was unbelieving.
During his studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all political viewpoints were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he told me pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dreaming bell towers.
Even my communist friends had irreproachable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent travels to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to the pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a session of works conducted the following week, when another history teacher suggested the most seriously in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Blushing internally with shame, I admitted to being a victim of my parents' brainwashing and called them "old fools".
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who broke the last nail in my Oxford coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press each week.
My door was locked.
I was still lurking in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me a whining chicken.
But no 18-year-old should be bullied in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Prime Ministers Tory, but also enjoys an unwavering reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: A Master of the Sewing", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized it at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 models of haute couture created for his fashion house over the last 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the highlight of a story whose only protagonist is "he knows" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, there are an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exhibits his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascent: from the modest fashion designer of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There is nothing wrong with loving royalty.
“At least they don’t crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet like some pop music stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60’s and 70’s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of the beauties of time spent like Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
Even so, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, also did not forget the charisma of the designer.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Spanish Steps, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
You could see and feel your mind in every detail of your apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the week of Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He will never go from fashion, because his creations are works of art," she concludes.
Nobility Lineage Parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He likes people well-behaved and with the biggest titles and they love him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous podium sixty meters wide that proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade on the podium to admire a dream "public" bearing the main creations of Valentino, as the tailor that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his wedding with Aristote Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a coat in
Among this audience of models, we find names like Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsbourg.
Naty Abascal and the designer in 2006
Many of his clients say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "unable to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trouser, a shirt, a "vest" vest and a jacket from the fall-winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It’s a gift he gave me,” said Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
"I prefer him to all others for his femininity, his great love of women, and because it sublimates our beauty," adds the ex-Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses, they are bright and illuminate the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashioner Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can also not forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of being old and old enough to wear one of her evening dresses...
This was finally possible in the late 90's.
I bought my first model Valentino for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward of Line.
It was a red evening dress, with a ruffled skirt, a draped bustier and a neckline to fall.
“It was a dream come true,” said Rodrigue d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless,” says the Italian aristocrat who divides his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess of Arenberg preserves the evening dresses of the designer with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, she is also the set of memories she conveys".
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn at her wedding with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the designer calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory silk dress with inlays of pearls, twelve kinds of different lace and a trail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the haute couture of the late twentieth century, "the return of the clients of high society".
Obsessed for years by the "know-how" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani has as many honours as any spouse of his clients.
"His refinement, his calm, his neat and perfect appearance have always jumped to my eyes," admits d'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says it...
The hardest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living carrying the sulfur of the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gas emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After harvesting large sulfur rocks, which weigh a total of nearly 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep trails.
There are only 250 meters up to the summit of the volcano which rises to 2.386 meters above sea level, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a turtle-like appearance, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to trip and fall into the precipice.
They know that a misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a deadly fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilo of sulfur extracted.
Once at the top, they make their way between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus beasts, and painfully carrying the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers to the balance that a mining company has installed a little below at 1.850 meters of altitude.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has operated the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) per kilo of sulfur.
It then sells it to 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry since this ore is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even serves to whiten sugar.
“As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) with each trip,” says Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Everyone takes him 3 hours and he finishes exhausted, but it allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is the triple of what he would gain in the fields.
“The income of miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” says the porter who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) a day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto came back near his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her back to Java so that she could be converted"
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, constantly coughs and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27, he spent three of his life defying danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulfur has already started to charge him the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, constantly coughs and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'm going to work another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Struggled by life, this friendly and intelligent young could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead, he does the work of a mule.
It shares a masure of unsanitary wood with other wearers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulfur does not cease to spring up at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater lighting up with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers charge the baskets of sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their own and are paid by weight.
In addition, they also do not receive a sun of the 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) of surcharge per camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is done for animals, not for humans,” said Madrusin, a 42-year-old body-wizer who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left college.
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... to which are obviously added their usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53, can only charge 50 kilos.
Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away by a goat trail overrun by weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik said, opening my mouth, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult professions in the world: that made by the human mules of the volcano Kawah ljen.
Singapore looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame this lack of children on the career, stress and cost of homeownership.
"The people of Singapore need to develop."
I am a husband and patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these lyrics come from an advertisement for mint lozenges, but despite this, or perhaps thanks to that, the video spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's go put a polichinelle in the drawer" to make fun of Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way through this advertising.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfill “their national duty.”
It is intended only for the Internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth rate, so we felt that this was a theme that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing perfumes at pheromones or organizing speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we said the following thing: what could be more creative to solve this problem than to make it a rap song?
1.2 children
The Singapore government doesn’t take it so lightly.
It spends US$1,300 a year on policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favour of marriages and fathers grants up to US$15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, in line with its national population distribution, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered the renewal rate, was in 1976.
Why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policies for the National Population Division, says it is due to a "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities."
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family building,” she says.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of singles and to delay marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter the decline in the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound a barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially against Chinese people who are accused of pulling wages down and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore last year experienced its worst electoral results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a country’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore’s example also has unintended consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, it started to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoebox", which can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of real estate firm EL Developers, says his "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular, in the sense that these housings are built much faster than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to developers, who were previously put in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small dwellings in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by talking with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre, it would seem that they will not have much effect.
“People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that’s why people put it off,” says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But for me, it's important to have my money and time," said another young man in our 20s.
Men and women mention their careers, the stress and cost of access to property and education as the reasons for having children.
So, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
In accordance with the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, this is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of privacy that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is in the private domain for those under 16?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he exposes himself to by broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15, frequent users of the web.
In four cases, they associated the term "something very personal" on a personal level and "the password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
“I won’t reveal my most personal secrets in a post,” says Jorge, ten, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone,” he said.
On FB, I post nice pictures or games.
I also talk to my friends.
“I won’t share one of my photos or someone who would be the fool,” he said.
The young boy acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photos, naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine followers on Twitter.
The majority are family.
Her mother is one of them, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I just post them,” he added.
“Social media is fun, I can talk with distant relatives or with my friends, quickly,” he says.
He says he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He will not trust anyone who would recommend a stranger to him either.
The case of José, 14, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people registered on his list of friends.
“I’m not worried because we have something in common, music for example,” he said.
According to the boy, no one made advances to him or asked for his address or phone number.
“If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply delete them from my account,” he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today as cyberbullying are no stranger to the young boy.
A relative of a friend of mine was racketed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who he was,” he said.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He only passed it in a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account in a safe way.
Unlike Jorge, this young person would post photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I was angry or angry.
“Even though I know it’s cyberbullying,” he said.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, considers that, in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet has emerged as a way to look for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed,” she said.
Porras reports that academician Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are the children and young people who were born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we ourselves are learning,” she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what should or should not be disclosed, published or said at an age when they do not have the maturity to do so."
“We also ask them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach privacy to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
“Teaching them not to do it is useless,” she said.
Then, Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a picture of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what others post about you?
When you identify holiday photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you are doing every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
“Outside the Internet, everyone has to act with respect, morality and other principles, it has to be the same on social media,” she said.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and education counselor, says it is essential that parents conscientiously read the conditions of use of social networks.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation for discussing with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that we should not talk to foreigners.
The Unasur summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration having been made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 representatives present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Unasur Heads of State and Government, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be disclosed after the summit closed, and then claimed that it would be published from one time to the next on the Peruvian government's website.
When asked about the text, they reported that its content had been exposed by Peru's President Ollante Humala in brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information about the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The lack of information circulating between the journalists was that given by the press attachés of some of the Unasur governments who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document leaked during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who were demanding more important information.
Later, Peru’s presidency sent an email to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but it was President Humala’s speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd South America-Arab Summit (ASPA) and, on that occasion, although this was requested with a forum by the press, it had also not circulated the statement also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official website of the ASPA, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to set up safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited the availability of information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court which decides a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the pleas of both sides in the lawsuit that Lima filed against Santiago and begins Monday in The Hague.
“We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes we face today before this international court,” said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of international controversies, treaties and tribunals,” Piñera said, giving a handshake to President Humala, alongside the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia this week denounced the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of that international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua, which it considered to be gravely wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the impeachment of its ex-president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was tasked with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been set between the South American countries for a total of 17 million dollars of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of Unasur would put in place "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions for better accessibility to medicines, low-cost Internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to see a better future for our populations," concluded President Humala.
“We have decided to focus on a group of 31 iconic projects that improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,” the Peruvian president said in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were on the cross-cutting axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aiming for a larger connection with Ecuador although it did not give further details.
Similarly, the outcome document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process of this country will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
Another theme addressed at the summit is the need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and with good relations with its neighbours.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through an ICJ judgment requested by Bogota.
“It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,” Santos said.
"We will revise all these paths, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua which will ask to have a discussion with this country," he said.
“I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will settle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos said.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City where they have planned to attend the seizure of power of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, within the framework of the summit, the Bloc’s defence ministers will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
“South America needs to learn from Europe how to integrate a citizenship,” says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which “South America, in this case, must take example of Europe.”
President Correa, who participated in the VI summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, told state television, TV Peru, that Europeans "had killed themselves during the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but that they were now almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the plan to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the President of Ecuador has shown himself in favour of the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the objective of diminishing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who reshuffle our ears never compromise anything, conversely, we South Americans have all signed it.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States,” he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself has not betrayed his principles, but on the contrary he has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, “there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected.”
In addition, he criticizes the Swedish court, which has demanded that he submit to his territory for interrogation of an alleged sexual offence while "the Swedish legislation allows it to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's mental and physical health will deteriorate.
"I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," he said.
It is possible that his physical and mental health will deteriorate by being locked in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
“This affects the health of anyone,” he concludes.
Correa reports that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the allocation of a safe-conduct that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities and he points out that he has had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the confinement of the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of proceedings with various European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain granted the safe-conduct tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as its legislation allows altogether, and as it has already done in other cases, would question Mr. Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or interrogated him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and he said that what he did not tolerate was "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
“The biggest enemies of press freedom are not malicious or perverse politicians but bad journalists in the pay of greed, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
From this angle, he welcomed that this is not the kind of journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate in Ecuador" and, rather than highlighting his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution to continue the path and chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto on Paraguay within Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and attempted coup d'état in disguise", because in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
Moreover, the Ecuadorian president considers as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overwhelmed by the will to move forward together.
We have to solve them as a whole to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he said he was confident in the good resolution of the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile in the same tribunal and said it is "beneficial that Latin America should refer international bodies to the two countries if they agree to accept a judgment so firm as it is".
Referring to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate in the future presidential elections in Ecuador, with a view to running for a third consecutive term, he reported that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 primaries, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, power has never interested me, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
"My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this eventual victory but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I will retire from political life.
If we ever lose, I will do it too.
“That’s my decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
“This does not mean a relapse of President Chávez’s state of health,” he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State today participated in Lima in the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of the test: HIV positive.
“It’s like the sky fell on my head,” he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make “less painful,” in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to learn about him and his relentlessness was such that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is, without a doubt, one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit at the Guadalajara Civilian Hospital (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 90s, where there were many doubts, few treatment choices and more stigmas.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was speechless."
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first reported cases, "the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HCG HIV unit, and he takes as a reference that this information was validated in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectiologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a fatal disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of assignment of the immune system that patients had at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those not using drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years
To put it simply, it means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis at 25, "as long as he remains under control, will be able to live without problems until the age of 75," the scientist explained.
In order to put this progress in context, it should be noted that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years on average.
While mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS has increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of patients on the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
Why are there still deaths?
I think the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the past 12 years at least, we have never missed any medication, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or they learn it in advanced stages of the disease.
He gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, for this, we must offer screening tests in a massive way, to all the people who ask for it".
Specialists and members of the State AIDS Prevention Council of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done so and that, despite his young age, he was already carrying AIDS and was suffering from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know.
"If I'm going to die, it's better that I have fun three times a week," they say, "it's not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he has cancer.
I have a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, through his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the World AIDS Day march.
Let them do the test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV-positive and the better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they must know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, argues Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who embraced the cause of HIV.
The biggest is prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packets of one hundred, it is very good, but the result is that even today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections is adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do with it?", asked with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers do not want to hear, says the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only sold at the counters, but that they are found in public toilet dispensers and in the places that young people frequent.
It is not a matter of encouraging promiscuity.
It is also not a question of paying them the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had replied when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
“This is not how sexuality works, the best is to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active,” he said.
Numbers to Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State is the 4th State of the country in number of new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of contamination is sexually, 6% by blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each case recorded, there are 4 or 5 people who do not.
A judgment ratified on appeal by a U.S. court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s debt through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario raises a harmful precedent for all national societies with ramifications in the neighbouring country with solvency problems.
It seems, therefore, that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country with the starry banner, against international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment rendered on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the North District of Texas, leaves Mexican companies defenseless in the face of the possibility of an embargo of their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico’s leading glass manufacturer to refer the case to the U.S. Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the case judge reports that creditors must register under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Appeals Court, sitting in New Orleans, claims that the main procedure is formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing the cooperation of international proceedings in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Trade Law had been created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the inter-corporate voting, recognised in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts incurred by Vitro's subsidiaries towards the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There are half a dozen examples here, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcies.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since there were still the votes of the subsidiaries, in all ways the creditors of Vitro who fought against this in the courts of the United States, that is to say the "vulture" funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained a majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes to 37.
A data omitted by the appeals court.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he has been facing since 2008 without stopping at the serious economic crisis facing the United States, passing on the costs to the country.
For the moment, the company of the González Sada family will appeal to the same court of appeal so that the vote takes place in its entirety, that is to say with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The claim of insurance will claim non-prosperity and requires the review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcies Act was detailed, noting that it released it from the conventions signed by both countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, he noted that the country had complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which guaranteed fairness for debtors and creditors.
Carambolage of two parts: they knock out Vitro and they knock out the country.
General balance sheet
The complaints of the unions of the Mexican Aviation Society against the former boss of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were ignored for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Syndicale des Pilotes Aviateurs has already encountered problems.
The body, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just submitted a criminal application against the National Banking Commission and Values which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority has systematically denied having provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on a transaction carried out by the contractor to withdraw from the F/589 trustee of the bank ILE 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of shares of the Professional Administration of Hotels.
As we all know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
They besiege the Dragon Mart
Meeting this weekend in an amphitheatre at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society have approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the Great Wall, with a residential area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in uniting the governors of the South-East zone in order to oppose the monumental project, which is partly on protected areas and represents the greatest of all the threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead
The government put forward a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeit Trade Agreement, known by its English acronym of ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already ancient history.
As everyone knows, this has been done well that the senate itself has condemned this possibility, because it was considered an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Baskelball is my whole life"
Basketball globetrotter “Hetin” Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in connection with the field and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as big as that of Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a brain hemorrhage condemned him to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower league player, national basketball team player, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or as president of the basketball federation.
"I have worn several caps in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, such as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 90s," Reyes recalls during a visit to Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball is my whole life."
Reyes doesn't exaggerate when he makes that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that recall his extraordinary itinerary, testify to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he likes the most are those that remind him of his time as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-50s until 1982, after spending 15 years as a co-manager or team manager.
“It was my best years, the best ones I enjoyed the most because I had the chance to compete in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967, whether as a manager, co-manager or manager.
It has been many years of satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired in the championship in 1981, the year that Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead of the team, "says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been a leader here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a strong player for you, he measures two meters.
Do you want it?"
That’s how Mincy started, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He was delighted with the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his and Mincy's charges in the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the 1989 pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we came 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge hadn’t made us play the last game again,” Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you’ve ever seen?
She is one of the best, as is the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won the gold and put a beating to the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world of 90 because of a problem
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won the gold against all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it is Piculín Ortiz.
His statistics in international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level as Piculín did.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team consisting of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I really like the work that Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success within the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What do you have left to do?
There are things that I would have liked to put in place, such as the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, that the boys of Ponce play only in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island during national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much while it is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for executives, field staff and referees.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch music videos of my time on YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, I attend basketball games.
And of course, I take advantage of the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide by the lead role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played an unscrupulous, formidable and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of avarice in the 1980's, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year in the role of J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a statement from the family sent to The associated Press for Warner Bros., a production company of "Dallas".
“Larry was back in his dear hometown of Dallas, playing again the ironic role he loved the most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, his press secretary, Jeffrey Lane, said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him a lot.
“He was an exceptional person and he was living life thoroughly,” Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed Larry Hagman with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he had admitted to having drunk a lot for many years.
In 1995, he was detected a malignant liver tumour and had undergone a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made himself known on television in the role of an ordinary guy in the series "Jinny of my dreams" broadcast by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and that he brought her home.
He also starred in two comedies that remained on the air for a short time, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his film roles are roles well received by critics in "The Band", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the delightfully detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman was his greatest success.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and their relatives aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, has generated speculation around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached an audience record at that time.
When the response was revealed in an episode of November 1980, an average of 41 million viewers were in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most-watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot her.
J.R. had pregnant her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reason to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable but charismaticly smiling man: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who was trying to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) interned.
“I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R,” Hagman said in 1988.
One should write: "This is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
Here's the only part he's lost.
Victoria Principal, co-rotagonist of the original series, recalled this Friday of Hagman as a man "immense, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already finished for the second season and a sixth is in the process of directing, the channel has informed.
For the time being, neither Warner nor TNT have communicated about how Hagman’s death will be incorporated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who knew fame with classic works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to her in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the stages of the New York theaters in the early 1950s and then served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life": Hello Darlin': The Merciless Memoirs of J.R.
“I didn’t write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told reporters at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist worried patients.
"I advise them, I give them confidence, I come with them when they come to have surgery and after," he said in 1996.
I try to offer them some comfort, like "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it's going to be okay."
He has also been a tobacco activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course on the "End of the World" has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was throwing an irresistible hook there: the end of the "great count" of the Mayan calendar, on December 21, to which many people refer to as being the proof of the imminent end of the world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what to expect in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal chasm that some have dubbed the “Debt Armageddon” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists thought the apocalypse would be triggered.
“I didn’t realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I’ve ever known,” Professor Charmé told his students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were telling it, it was a very good time.
And we must remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he is not the only professor to give courses on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker teaches the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human conduct.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with real-life examples.
“I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply titled "The End of the World."
“We’re adding ‘2012’ to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world doesn’t disappear,” Professor Restall said.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and take their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed the day before the Apocalypse, leaving students with no choice but to work “until the very night of the supposed end of the world,” Restall said.
Classes have proved to be quite popular.
“It’s been full in two hours,” Restall said of its course for high-level students, consisting of 35 students.
We received email messages several weeks before the start of the semester, from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves,” says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religious and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, University of Rutgers-Camden.
For the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or of lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and infirmary student, says he has watched all the apocalyptic films.
“I had never heard of a course teaching this subject,” he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone a professor, told us to believe in the end date of the world of December 21.
“Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy, and in a way we discredited it,” said Julie Zegle, a 21-year-old graduate student at Temple from West Chester.
The Mayans have never predicted the end of the world, it’s only a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I concede that there is anxiety related to the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a rise in these speculations.
“In other parts of the world, people don’t think about that,” he said.
This is the majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religious professor at La Salle University who lectures in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew he was given classes here on "the end of the world."
“The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world,” he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall points out that over the years, we have talked about the many supposed dates of the last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing about the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a 7-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and professors take the date lightly.
Several told us that they thought they were going to “the end of the world” parties.
“Sometimes I call friends and we laugh about it together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
