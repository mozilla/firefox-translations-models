Good evening !
Our planet is 70% covered by ocean, and yet, strangely, we have chosen to call it “Earth”.
The poet Heathcote Williams has a much more objective and less anthropocentric vision, when he says that “Viewed from space, the planet is blue.
Seen from space, it is the territory, not of men, but of whales”.
And yet, we all come from the ocean.
It is the cradle of life, even if we have forgotten it.
The ocean is everywhere: in glaciers, rivers, groundwater, in the cells of living beings, and in our veins.
Strangely, it was John Fitzgerald Kennedy who illustrated it quite well, in this quote: “It is an interesting biological fact that everyone has in their veins an equal percentage of salt in their blood, to that which exists in the oceans.
So we all have salt in our blood, our sweat, our tears.
We are linked to the ocean, and when we return to the sea, whether to sail, or to watch it, we return to where we came from. »
And yet, we know very, very little about this ocean.
It remains a rather strange and foreign world, which is sometimes scary.
That said, in fact, it is far from being an inert body of water, a body of water that is useless.
In fact, it is the marine life that makes this ocean a main regulator of the climate, the main carbon sink, and also, the main producer of oxygen.
Between 50 and 70% of oxygen comes from the ocean.
So, in fact, more than one in two breaths you take, you owe it to the ocean.
Not quite at the ocean!
In fact, you owe it to marine life.
Marine life is what allows this body of water, precisely, not to be just an inert body of water, but to be this machinery that allows us to live.
And, marine life starts from phytoplankton, which provides oxygen, to large whales, passing through large predators, tunas, dolphins... And among these species, there are some that are ecologically more important than others, especially sharks.
It is, therefore, the example that I chose because it is an animal that we tend to demonize, a sea monster.
And yet, every year, 70 million sharks are slaughtered.
It&#39;s as if we were exterminating the equivalent of France.
Now, sharks are the record keepers of evolution.
They are 470 million years old.
This means concretely that, for 470 million years, all life in the ocean has been shaped by, and according to sharks.
And as a “top” predator, keystone species, when you remove sharks from an ecosystem, you have a collapse in marine biodiversity.
So, where the sharks have disappeared, we have dead water, or we have explosions of jellyfish, but we have no more life.
So !
That is the role of predators.
We, as humans, tend to consider ourselves the “top” predators.
And yet, we are far from being predators, since, in Nature, predators are, on the one hand, regulated by the availability of their prey - but this is no longer the case for us since we have invented agriculture and animal husbandry - on the other hand, predators tend to breed less.
So cheetahs or lions are going to have far fewer cubs than mice or rabbits.
Mice and rabbits are naturally prey, so they need to breed very quickly, and in very large numbers.
Sharks, whales, dolphins, are predators.
They weren&#39;t designed to be prey.
We have preyed on them!
So they cannot, in fact, survive predatory human pressure.
There is also a common point to all these marine animals, whether they are predatory or not.
It is that they all participate in marine life, that is to say a life cycle, unlike us.
To give you an example of blue whales, a blue whale produces, every day, 3 tons of excrement - excrement which is very rich in nitrogen or nitrogen - and these are the essential nutrients for the phytoplankton which provides us with oxygen we breathe.
In fact, we&#39;ve lost 40% of the phytoplankton population over the past 50 years, largely because of the extermination of whales in the 20th century and earlier, but even more so with the invention of the explosive harpoon.
The man goes to sea.
It is not part of this ecosystem.
We haven&#39;t been part of it since we left the ocean.
We are therefore an intruder.
We are an intruder with means of fishing, of predation, which are, today, industrialized.
And we are a predator who no longer has the natural limits of predators.
So, we are more than 7 billion, and today, 7 billion human beings want to eat fish.
So that is a big problem.
The other problem is this illusion that we have had for a long time, and that we may still have, but less and less, that in fact marine life is unlimited.
Jules Michelet, who wrote a fairly well-known book, which is a reference on the subject, illustrates this quite well: “At certain narrow passages, you cannot row, the sea is rough.
Millions of millions, billions of billions who will dare to guess the number of these legions.
It is said that once, near Le Havre, a single fisherman found 800,000 one morning.
In a Scottish port, 11,000 barrels were made in one night. »
When we read the historical testimonies, we are told that off the west coast of the French Atlantic, we saw whales passing by for days, the boats had to stop.
Those near the coasts, sometimes did not sleep, so much the breath of the whales made noise.
Today, when we see a fin, we are amazed.
We lost our memory of what the sea was like before we started fishing.
Here is also a quote from Thomas Huxley that illustrates well the lack of knowledge and the denial in which we were: “Nothing we do can affect the number of fish. »
And yet, today, we have already exterminated 90% of the big fish in the ocean.
The problem also is that it is difficult to have empathy for fish.
It&#39;s hard enough to save whales.
Whales are charismatic animals with a lot of sympathy.
Yet today, in 2016, they continue to die under the blows of explosive harpoons, despite the moratoriums, despite the sanctuaries.
It&#39;s also one of Sea Shepherd&#39;s main battles because we consider that if we can&#39;t save the whales, it&#39;s going to be very difficult to save anything else in the ocean, again. minus the sharks that we consider to be monsters, or the tunas, which don&#39;t interest us.
Fish are so discredited that they are referred to in terms of tons.
So we are going to tell you about 13,000 tonnes of quotas, 13,000 tonnes of tuna, or 15,000 tonnes of sharks.
Would you be shocked if I spoke of tons of giraffes, or tons of dogs, or tons of... French!
Fish are not even considered individuals.
It is simply a mass that is part of a stock, which may need to be preserved, in order to make exploitation as profitable as possible in a sustainable manner.
SO !
We can ask ourselves, say to ourselves that, in the end, if the fish disappear, if the ocean is bad, anyway, we are fine.
We are many.
We are everywhere.
Still, beware because there are misleading signs.
In reality, what precedes the extinction of a species are several factors, including these three, which are the main ones: the demographic explosion, the overexploitation of resources, and the occupation of all ecological niches, that is to say the fact of spreading everywhere.
Maybe it reminds you of someone...
In fact, if you&#39;re looking for an example of an endangered species, don&#39;t google it, you look at yourself in the mirror, or you look at your neighbor.
So we&#39;re not doing so well!
Today, we are talking about sustainable fishing.
And yet, United Nations scientists predict a collapse of fisheries by 2048.
2048 is 32 years away, so it&#39;s... tomorrow morning.
What does a fishery collapse actually mean?
It means more fish.
It doesn&#39;t just mean that you won&#39;t have any fish on the menu or that when you go to the fishmongers they will be empty, it means the death of the ocean.
Because as I explained earlier, before being a food source for anyone, fish, like marine life, are the essential working force that allows the ocean, precisely, to to be this extraordinary machinery that allows us to live.
Imagine having to go without more than every other breath.
Imagine that all that carbon dioxide that is captured in the ocean, which is even greater than what is captured by forests, ends up in the atmosphere.
In fact, it would be the end of human civilization.
SO...
Basically, I gave you reasons, I gave you very down-to-earth reasons, let&#39;s say, why defend the ocean.
Finally, the solution is quite simple, for us, for everyone.
If you are not directly dependent on fish for a living, it is best to refrain from eating them.
Seven billion human beings will never be able to eat fish.
We will, in effect, exterminate marine life.
So that&#39;s when you think in a utilitarian way, because the leitmotif is this: if the ocean dies, we die.
So, if we want to live, and we want our children to be able to live after us, we will have to take radical measures, and change our lifestyles, “adapt”.
That is the key word of evolution and of species that want to survive.
As Darwin told us, adapt or die.
So we&#39;re going to have to adapt, and adapt quickly.
But, on a personal level, what motivates me, me, in all this, and what makes me here, in front of you, this evening, is not so much this question of survival, utilitarian, commendable, but utilitarian.
In fact, it&#39;s rather... this difficulty that I have in living with this injustice that we inflict, in fact, on everything that is weaker than us, and I find that it is morally and ethically , the engine that drives me - an injustice that is very well described by Milan Kundera, in this quote from &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;: &quot;The true goodness of man cannot manifest itself in all purity and in complete freedom, only with regard to those who do not represent any force.
Humanity&#39;s true moral test - the most radical one, which lies at a level so deep that it escapes our gaze - is its relationship with those at its mercy: animals.
And it is here that the fundamental failure of man occurred, so fundamental that all the others flow from it...” Thank you!
(Applause)
My daily life is made up of sensations that most of you are unaware of.
For a long time, I was ashamed of it.
I remember very well the circumstances in which I discovered this difference.
I was 4 years old and I wanted to express to my mother the joy I felt looking at the sun through a leaf and I told her not about the leaf as such, but about the colors and sensations which were caused by what I had felt when I saw the leaf: these yellow and green lines, this very particular taste, halfway between sugar, mint, cucumber, which came to me by following the veins and imagining all a series of possible futures, imagination, like a golden mist, joy like shimmering water… She just thought I was crazy.
And then, so, I hid it and growing up, I got frustrated to keep these perceptions that I think were very beautiful to myself and I tried to represent them in this painting that you see.
Immediately, thinking about these emotions, I also found those I had felt while listening to this music, Verdi&#39;s Va Pensiero.
(Music) Synesthesia is not a disease, it&#39;s just a different perception of things that leads senses that normally are not connected to each other to enter into a relationship.
For example, you hear the musical note mi, and you see it blue or green.
You taste an apple and the taste of this apple will evoke a geometric shape.
It is innate and it is involuntary.
There is a multitude of different synesthesias, this would concern according to debated evaluations approximately one person in 2000; discussed because most synesthetes are unaware of being a synesthete until they discover the existence of the phenomenon.
Thanks to my synesthesia, my emotions, my thoughts, my associations of ideas, as you have seen, my little inner voice, everything appears to me in the form of colors, shapes, tastes, movements.
It enriches the perception of the world and the paintings I try to do to represent all of this are about as faithful to the original perception as a freeze frame is to a 3 hour movie or a photo of a cake. chocolate compared to a real chocolate cake.
But it&#39;s still much more than words.
Words don&#39;t say anything about the world and that&#39;s what I tried to paint in this painting: at the bottom on the left, you have reality, the emotions it inspires in me, the thoughts, above, the imaginary; at the crossroads of the imaginary and the real, the voice.
And little by little, you have this narrowing going to the right, when it is necessary to pass all this interior richness in this very small dead end, the words.
Throughout my childhood, I said to myself why hadn&#39;t specific words been invented to express all this wealth?
Why didn&#39;t we invent a specific word to talk about the joy we feel when we look at the sunlight in a leaf?
Why didn&#39;t we invent another different word to express the joy we feel when we see our child again, when we see our spouse?
However, that has nothing to do with it.
Probably because it was not considered useful and in fact, recent research on synesthesia would tend to show that we all have, every child, these extra nervous connections, which explain synesthesia.
But we are losing them little by little.
There is no fatality in that, words are a framework, it has a convention that allows us to communicate, now nothing prevents us from keeping the richness of our perception.
Yet we don&#39;t, we lock ourselves into the frame of words, we narrow our perception of the world to those words when nothing obliges us to, probably because we think that&#39;s what others expect from us. We.
In antiquity, studies carried out on ancient languages showed that colors were perceived in a very particular order: first black, white, red, green or yellow, and finally blue.
So this sea you see blue, the ancient Greeks saw it purple, for example.
Conversely, where you see snow, a Scot may think of one of the 421 words used in their language to talk about snow.
Inevitably, it has an impact on the way we see the world, how we perceive it, it is probably this change of scenery that we are looking for by going to the other side of the planet to discover new landscapes, of course, but also new ways of seeing, of perceiving.
And very curiously, no one takes this journey which can be just as fascinating, which consists simply of asking their neighbor or neighbor: “What does your perception of the world, your little inner voice tell you? »
If I make you travel in my synesthesia, you will enter a world where using the same word remains the best guarantee of not understanding each other.
When I worked in financial diplomacy about 13 to 14 years ago, there was a very fashionable term, it was &quot;sound policy&quot;, &quot;sound policies&quot; which was used to designate the policies that should be set up a country to benefit from aid or debt reduction.
In the vision of the UN, “sound policies” meant global respect for human rights and not too much corruption.
For the IMF, it was a balanced budget, period.
For the World Bank, it is the vision of the UN, that of the IMF, and then other things, investments in economic development in the broad sense, agriculture, urbanization, transport.
Now, you put these three international organizations at the same table, on the same text, using the same word, visually, you see right away that there will be many misunderstandings.
You may be able to grasp the beauty of the diplomatic language which consists in giving the illusion of an agreement where there is not necessarily one in order to be able to move forward, but you will also understand why there is then a need for a whole bureaucracy to deal with what happens next.
To enter into my synesthesia is also to apprehend an environment where thoughts and emotions appear at the same time as a satellite map and at the microscope level.
I represented in this painting the vision that comes to me when I think, in a novel that I am writing, of the meeting between the main character, Arthur, and his friend Bérénice, at a time when Bérénice is hurt, the way they will fall in love and then lose sight of each other.
Behind this overall vision, you have plenty of more microscopic visions which correspond to details of the chapter, to character elements of the characters.
For example, the painting on your left designates and illustrates Arthur&#39;s view of Berenice&#39;s character.
A cheerful young girl who is hopeful but also exhibits incomprehensible dark ideas.
If I vary the circumstances of their meeting, if they meet at the beach, if Arthur&#39;s character is different, if Bérénice loses her dark ideas, immediately, the vision that I will have of the chapter will change, both at the satellite level and at the microscope level.
You&#39;re probably wondering what&#39;s the point of being a synesthete?
It&#39;s a difficult question insofar as it&#39;s something we don&#39;t control, we are born with it.
But we can play with it and have fun with it.
Personally, I find that it is a great richness to always be on the border between two frameworks: the synesthetic one in which I think and the one of words in which I try to communicate today.
Playing with frames means, for example, not brainstorming at the level of the words but at the level of the perceptions and sensations that precede these words.
I&#39;m willing to bet that the creators of Cleopatra glue, which some here may remember, thought a lot more about the almond-like smell of this glue than about its glue properties as such.
Playing with frames also means not feeling constrained by how others will receive your message.
So, I wanted to write a poem and make a painting that illustrated the synesthetic vision that had given rise to this poem.
I talked about it to a publisher who told me that he wasn&#39;t interested, that the important thing was the text, the painting, we didn&#39;t care at all.
I spoke about it to a gallery owner who had the opposite reaction: the painting is the most important, the text, we don&#39;t care.
And then well, after a first moment of discouragement, I said to myself that the most important thing was the message: what was the form, what was the mode of expression that was adequate for this message?
So, if I try to write a poem to express the emotion that my synesthesia gives me on a daily basis, it could look like this: the fire dismasted in the fury of sounds, rearing up like a sun, the almond of reality with orphan constellations dazzles interline thought with nonexistent vertigo.
This is the poem that corresponds to the painting you have in front of you.
For me, the two are linked and inseparable.
Now, lovers of poetry will be more sensitive to poems or not, lovers of painting will be more sensitive to painting or not, but in the end, it doesn&#39;t matter, because here ends the adventure of my perception and here begins yours.
(Applause)
Good morning.
Do you know what I do every day when I walk in Paris?
I can not help it.
I open the trash cans and look at what&#39;s inside.
At first, it was embarrassing for my children.
Now I am very happy because they are like me.
So, from the trash, I take out bottles, flasks, cans, tins and a lot of cardboard every day.
These materials are recyclable materials.
They don&#39;t belong in this trash can.
Nothing at all.
And yet, they are there.
To sort, it takes three seconds.
One two Three.
Three seconds.
It is not long and yet, multiplied by 65 million inhabitants every day, it is enormous for the environment.
Enormous.
So these three seconds, when do we need them?
We need it when we&#39;ve had lunch.
We need it when we&#39;ve had dinner.
We need it when we get rid of it, we ask ourselves the question: do I throw away or do I sort?
Do I lose or do I win?
So what do we lose and what do we gain?
We all lose a lot when we don&#39;t sort.
Because these recyclable materials, they are wasted.
They will either be burned or buried in landfills.
And we are not going to tell a story: when they are in landfills, there is a little bit that will go to the forests, in the countryside and in the sea.
When we all sort, we gain a lot.
Enormously.
A can that is sorted, it will first be transported, sorted, collected, transformed, pampered, and it will become a can again or even a bicycle, a car, a whole series of objects.
And it&#39;s the same for glass, it&#39;s the same for plastic, bottles, cans, and it&#39;s the same for cardboard.
All of these materials, if they are put in the right bin, [will] be able to be reused.
We can all sort, all sort, at the bottom of our house or next to us.
All.
And it takes 3 seconds.
This ability we have to sort, this ability we have not to pollute, it is simple.
And we owe it to two men.
Two men who, in the 90s, changed the game.
Remember back then the landfills.
It was everywhere, it was overflowing and we couldn&#39;t manage the environmental impact of consumption.
And there, these two men decided to trust each other.
Instead of having the classic reflex of saying: &quot;Come on, let&#39;s create a tax!&quot; »
and then we will create an administration, there will be an administration that takes care of it.
And then we forget the subject.
These two men, Brice Lalonde, Minister of Ecology in 1992 and Antoine Riboud, boss of Danone, they decide to do otherwise.
While few people were talking about ecology in 1992, they said: “Here, we are going to create a private company, a non-profit company, but it will be private.
And she&#39;s going to do 100% general interest.
100% private, 100% dedicated to the general interest to focus on this subject.
So she will recruit and she will make sure to attract other companies. »
Another 50,000 consumer goods companies joined and worked with local communities.
An incredible invention, and the public then, he was going to actually collect, sort and recycle.
The private company Éco-Emballages was going to be the pilot of the system and the State was going to control and set the objectives.
At that moment, it creates a dynamic.
Companies, brands, associations, local authorities, municipalities, waste operators and recyclers, while they all have a radically different culture, unite and say to each other: “Come on, let&#39;s go. »
And the yellow bin is installed everywhere, or almost and the sorting begins.
Today, we are in an extremely efficient system.
In fact, the Éco-Emballages company operates in a simple manner.
A company that sells a packaged product will pay a lot if the packaging is heavy.
If the packaging is light, eco-designed, she will pay less.
Afterwards, Éco-Emballages finances the whole thing.
650 million euros are invested each year in sorting, collection and recycling.
So, today, I am also here to tell you that we are having difficulties.
In fact, for a few years, the collection has not progressed.
She is stable.
And I have two pebbles in my shoe.
The first is the city.
In the city, we recycle half as much as in the countryside.
We recycle only 30% in the city.
It means when in this room, there is only one sorter out of three.
And bad news, in a few years, in less than ten years, 85% of us will live in the city.
The second pebble in the shoe I have is the plastic.
In 1950, we produced 1.5 million tons of plastic.
Today we produce 350 million.
In some time, we will produce 750 million tons of plastic.
And the problem is that plastic is only 23% recycled.
If we don&#39;t sort the plastic, it becomes that.
You have to sort the plastic because the seventh continent exists.
The seventh continent, it&#39;s in the sea, it&#39;s plastic particles which, little by little, run off and will create the biggest landfill in the world.
There is an alternative to that.
If we ever do that, if we ever take that bottle, and everything else and put it in that bin and use it, then what happens?
This is happening.
That&#39;s plastic that can remake a bottle.
It&#39;s plastic that is made without petroleum, it&#39;s plastic that remakes all the objects we can use every day, without touching natural resources.
It&#39;s plastic that comes from the yellow bin.
It&#39;s plastic that comes from your sorting gesture.
And that&#39;s why today, I&#39;m launching a call for ideas, a call for projects.
Between yourselves, with your friends, your associations, in the neighborhoods, let&#39;s try to find projects, ideas that will relaunch collection, that will allow us to produce this, that will allow us to transform plastic into resources.
And a resource has value.
A family that does not sort today is like throwing 30 euros a year in the trash.
You will say to me: “It&#39;s not much, 30 euros here. »
But if we take two hundred apartments that do the same thing in a building, that&#39;s 6,000 euros.
A city or a district of 30,000 inhabitants is worth 900,000 euros per year.
This is why I am launching this call for projects.
Organize yourself, send us your proposals.
With local authorities, we will find solutions to select and finance them.
Today I would like to tell you that our only competitor is inaction, and that three seconds, three seconds to create a barrier to pollution, it&#39;s simple and it&#39;s great.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Good evening everyone.
I will tell you my story.
I am 17 years old, high school diploma.
My father only dreams of one thing: that I prepare for the competitions for the Grandes Ecoles.
He himself is at ESCP, where he teaches computer science and marketing.
And he said to me: “Go ahead my son, hang on!
Go beyond your limits! »
Me, in fact, I think of only one thing, it is especially to exceed the limits of my district.
I can only think of one thing: to travel far, [not only] to France but elsewhere.
Suddenly, I enrolled modestly in the faculty of Nanterre University in ethnology, then in ethnomusicology.
Ah!
This is a good opportunity to travel.
I am working on my dissertation on the music of Benin, of northern Benin, a population called the Nyende.
Two months of travel, four months of travel...
But now, I&#39;m struggling to finish my university course.
I only think of one thing: to play music.
I am a drummer, percussionist.
I work in different formations of world music.
I love all types of music: beguine, jazz, African music, Balkan music, raï, and so on.
In 2004, I founded my own band called Haïdouti Orkestar.
What is the Haïdouti Orkestar?
It is the meeting of music from the Balkans, music from the East and Turkish music.
An entire program !
Does that remind you of something ?
Does that speak to you a bit?
Not really.
So, this group is made up of musicians from very, very different backgrounds.
As Georges Moustaki would say: a real group of “wogs”.
There is a Greek from Rue de la Roquette who barely lines up three words of Greek; a pure gypsy from Serbia, a Bulgarian, French people - yes, French people like me, but with a bit of scratching, never really French - a Spaniard but who claims to be Catalan please, from Barcelona.
Do you know this group, Haïdouti Orkestar?
No.
I hear &quot;Yes&quot;, there is a person.
Good, here&#39;s an excerpt.
(Video: Haïdouti Orkestar - “Ya Ayn Moulayiitain”) (Sylvain on stage) It&#39;s a song in homage to Syria, to the Arab Spring, at a time when we still have a little hope.
Normally, in concert, people get up and start dancing.
You can... It feels good too!
(Claps rhythmically) (End of video) (Applause) Thank you!
I discovered this music at the end of the 80s, it&#39;s starting to date, especially through the films of Emir Kusturica &quot;The Time of the Gypsies&quot;, &quot;Underground&quot;.
I think everyone knows these movies.
Yes still !
Me, it&#39;s love at first sight, an incredible click.
I am passionate about this music.
I literally fall in love with these musics and I deepen the question.
It is the beginning of a long immersion in these cultures.
In this journey, I will meet people, musicians, because, for me, it is a question of entering this environment of Balkan music - in the music of the gypsies, I don&#39;t know anyone - meeting Turkish music, look for all that.
There you go, it&#39;s done.
I will portray three people who meant a lot to me.
The first: it&#39;s Jasko Ramic.
Behind, there is a woman with a snorkel.
She&#39;s the only woman in the group please.
I think about her a lot, her name is Charlotte.
Back to Mr. Jasko Ramic.
He is a gypsy from Serbia.
He is a true accordion virtuoso, a real &quot;size&quot;, as we say in the jargon.
He has an empirical, theoretical knowledge of all this music.
I meet him in a cellar in Paris.
A Bulgarian musician friend introduced him to me.
In addition, he is a polyglot man.
He speaks Russian.
He speaks Romani, and Serbo-Croatian.
But here I am, I speak French.
And I can&#39;t communicate with him.
Big problem, how to overcome this limit?
Finally, we don&#39;t talk, we play.
Since then, we have been working together for more than 10 years.
He makes me discover this culture, this music, its energy, its nostalgia.
And me, I see that what I learn really contrasts with what I hear in the media.
In the media, what do I hear when they talk about gypsies?
I hear things that aren&#39;t very nice.
It&#39;s about slums, it&#39;s about kidnapping children.
And me, I really live something else.
I travel to Bulgaria, Macedonia, Greece.
I feel safe there.
I&#39;ve met generous people who literally give me their music.
So.
I advise you to go and see the work of La voix des Rroms, which is an association that takes care of all this Roma problem and which gives a positive image.
A second person who meant a lot to me, he is a trumpeter.
He is Lebanese, but in fact mostly French since he grew up a few kilometers from here, in the south of the department.
This boy has incredible energy.
I meet him, he is 25 years old.
So it&#39;s been a good ten years.
He is Lebanese and his parents fled Lebanon.
That&#39;s important.
This boy, today, he is very well known.
His name is Mr. Ibrahim Maalouf.
I think you know him.
This boy takes us to the Olympia.
Recently, we wrote the music for the film &quot;La Vache&quot; by Mohamed Hamidi, with Djamel Wilson... Djamel Debbouze, Lambert Wilson!
(Laughs) (Video: “Le grand voyage”) (Sylvain on stage) That&#39;s the meeting of cultures!
Here is an excerpt.
(Video: Ibrahim Maalouf and Haïdouti Orkestar - “Le grand voyage”) (Sylvain on stage) That&#39;s the instrument I play, among others.
I am a drummer and I play the drum.
(End of video) (Applause) A third person who has meant a lot to my career, my journey, is Mr. Zéki Çölaş This man comes to us from Antioch in Turkey.
It is 80 km from Syria.
He fled Turkey at the age of 30 for political reasons, the saz under his arm.
It passes through Syria, transits and stays in Germany, and ends up in France, in Bobigny.
So this man, I met him in a restaurant in Paris, a good fifteen years ago. I don&#39;t really know if it was a Kurdish restaurant or a Turkish restaurant.
At the time, for me, it was a little bit the same.
But no, in fact, it&#39;s very very different.
With this man, we will walk.
He is going to show me “little Istanbul”.
Do you know little Istanbul?
The district of little Istanbul is the Turkish district in Paris between Château d&#39;Eau and Strasbourg Saint-Denis.
It is here that the culture and and all this community is found.
So we walk the streets.
We&#39;re going to meet his friends from the Özgül bookstore.
We go to listen to the latest news from Tuana Music, the only Turkish music store in Paris.
All the news, records, musical instruments, you can find everything related to Turkey.
Very quickly, we wanted to share things, to make known this Turkish music that we don&#39;t know, which is really unknown in France.
And we also decided to go even further and open up to other cultures.
Well, I had another card earlier.
It&#39;s not the same thing.
In any case, we are also interested in Armenia, in Azerbaijan.
We try to go beyond our limits, to cross borders.
You will notice this whole region a bit, today it is a real powder keg, between the migrant problem the Kurdish problem, Erdogan today who is becoming a real dictator - we can say that clearly.
That&#39;s when associations get in touch with us, associations that have values that are somewhat similar to ours, that are for sharing.
I&#39;m thinking of Cimade, Value Added.
La Cimade, I meet them in Massy, not far from here.
Every year, they have a party where we eat lots of things, different dishes from all countries.
That was another moment of sharing.
I&#39;m also thinking of BAAM, the Office for Reception and Support for Migrants.
Last September, we did a concert.
Same, it was a great moment of emotion and sharing.
Somalis, Eritreans, Turks, French, everyone found themselves together to commune around our music.
It was a big moment.
Well, more recently, I also wanted to go beyond genres so I went to meet jazz.
(Video: Haïdouti Orkestar and Bojan Z-Tchagri) (Sylvain on stage) He&#39;s a Bosnian pianist.
I wanted, with this presentation, to show you how much music and my encounters had opened me up to the world, and that interbreeding is a way of opening up to the world.
So.
THANKS.
(Applause)
It is early in the morning.
You look at yourself in the mirror.
What do you say ?
Not so long ago, I used to say, “Hey!
Hello handsome. »
(Laughs) Unfortunately, I found myself saying to myself “Ouch, oh, oh…” “it looks like my grandfather! »
Maybe you like what you see in the mirror.
Or maybe not...
In any case, you recognize this image as yours.
How do you recognize yourself?
What is your identity?
This subject is crucial, because the way we define ourselves affects the way we relate to others.
Before, I thought I had a very solid identity!
I was a Mexican ready to conquer the rest of the world.
So I started by moving to Paris.
Eleven years ago.
And everything was going according to my plans, until last year.
Indeed, 3 events led me to wonder: “Who is this person I call me? »
&quot; Good morning !
We know each other ? »
The first event, I call it: “Meeting with the ancestors”.
One day, when I was surfing the Internet, I read an article that said: &quot;If your last name is among the names on this list, then you may be a descendant of one of the Sephardic Jewish families who are expelled from Spain in the 15th century. »
And maybe soon you will be able to apply for Spanish nationality.
I checked the list!
To my surprise, my father&#39;s last name, Meza, was there.
As a Mexican, I expected to have some Spanish blood in my veins.
But I never imagined that... Does that mean there&#39;s a bit of Jewish blood running through my Mexican veins?
Is that why I liked the movie Fiddler on the Roof so much?
Or even, more importantly: am I now allowed to put guacamole in my falafel?
(Laughter) It may be crazy, but since reading this article, I feel closer to my Jewish side.
The second event: “Elementary cell identity course” Here I am in conversation with my friend, Julien, a French biologist by trade.
He explains this to me: “Antonio, from the point of view of biology, I can tell you that this question about your identity makes no sense.
Let me explain: your cells reproduce and die, okay?
And your body needs seven years for full regeneration.
So you can say that after seven years you are an entirely different person than you were before. »
“Wait! I tell him.
You know that I have lived in France for eleven years.
And you&#39;re telling me that all this time, the cells in my body have been regenerating with proteins coming directly from camembert!
Cassoulet!
And duck confit?
(Laughter) Does that mean that, from a biological point of view, I am already French? »
(Laughs) It may be crazy, but since this conversation with Julien, I feel closer to my French side.
And finally !
The third event: &quot;The transition from the ring to the finger&quot; And yes, last year I got married.
Thanks thanks.
(Applause) And my lovely wife is German!
(Laughs) Finally, his mother is German and his father is Hungarian.
So she&#39;s half German and half Hungarian.
It might be crazy, but since getting married, I feel much closer to my new German and Hungarian sides!
It&#39;s like a whole new family!
But, can you imagine the day when we will have a child?
How to explain to him?
“My son, my daughter, your Mexican origins mean that you have Spanish and Aztec roots.
But also Jewish roots!
Besides, you have a German trunk and Hungarian branches!
And you grew on French soil.
That makes you a very exotic plant! »
(Laughs) I think my children will need at least four passports!
And good therapy.
Following all these events, I was completely lost.
Who are my people?
Do I have to give up who I am before embracing who I&#39;m becoming?
Who is this person I call &quot;me&quot;?
In the end it was me who needed some good therapy!
But a few weeks later, I was taking a personal development course offered by my friend Robert from California.
At some point during the seminar, Robert offered us this exercise: You are face-to-face with another person, and looking at this person, you say: “I see you.
And I can see your strength.
And I can see your fragility.
And I know you are much more than that! »
When Robert explained this exercise, I really thought it was California hippie madness!
(Laughter) But, when my exercise partner said those words to me... (Long breath) It might be crazy, but I felt a lot closer to myself.
Finally, I didn&#39;t need to know in my head who I was, I could simply recognize myself in the eyes of the other.
And his eyes became the mirror where I could recognize myself, I saw my origins, and my potential.
I could embrace the whole thing.
I could be much more than I imagined... And that&#39;s good!
It&#39;s early in the morning, you look at yourself in the mirror.
What do you say ?
You are much more than the color of your skin, much more than the borders of your countries and much more than your genetic heritage.
So tomorrow morning, when you go see yourself in the mirror, try saying this to yourself: “Hello!
I see you.
And I can see your strength.
And I can see your fragility.
And I know that you are much, much more than all of this. »
THANKS.
(Applause)
Can you imagine patients having to wait weeks before they can be treated?
Last year, a hospital called me to coach a ward that was about to close.
It was going to jeopardize part of the organization of the hospital.
The doctors resigned one after the other, the administrative and nursing staff were completely demotivated.
And after analysis, it turned out that all this was related to the leadership style of the department head, whom we will call Doctor X.
This doctor X is someone very authoritarian, very controlling and very little communicator.
And yet, he is a world authority in his field of expertise.
You and I, as patients, want to be healed by these demigods on Earth, but if he&#39;s not able to keep his team, chances are his expertise will disappear with him, and he won&#39;t. cannot treat as many patients as it does today.
Being an excellent doctor does not make him an excellent manager.
And that, the headhunters have understood.
I&#39;m Marie-Bernard Guillaume, and I&#39;m going to explain to you this evening why, from a headhunter, I became a hearthunter.
Most business leaders I meet share the same concern: how do you motivate your staff?
According to Gallup studies, only one employee in ten is really happy at work, passionate.
Seven out of ten come to do their job, but you shouldn&#39;t ask them for more.
Two out of ten are even active saboteurs: they come with their discomfort and they prevent others from functioning properly.
Imagine the disaster it would be if we applied this ratio to our national football team, to our Red Devils.
There, you start to have pain, you understand the problem of the managers.
What makes an employee motivated?
Do you all know Maslow&#39;s pyramid?
Forget her.
(Laughter) Other studies have shown that we all share three needs, three motivating factors, which are universal, whether we are male or female, whether we are young or old.
Regardless of philosophical or religious beliefs, we share these factors and needs.
The first need is the need for personal development.
It&#39;s being able to use my abilities to realize my dreams, to achieve goals: “Wow, how good am I!
I succeeded!
I am proud of myself. »
The second need is the need for autonomy.
It&#39;s being able to do what I want, when I want, and how I want.
The third need is the need for connectivity.
It&#39;s being able to feel like you belong and have a connection with a community, with a team, with a family.
It&#39;s being supported, being liked on Facebook.
And so, as you will have understood, the company that is able to respond to these three factors has a good chance of seeing the engagement rate of its employees much higher than elsewhere.
However, most managers today still operate, like our doctor X, with a hierarchical pyramid that is well defined, with roles and functions that frame the roles of everyone, which has the effect of to bully, to kill any need for autonomy and any taking of initiative.
Fortunately, more and more companies have understood this problem and are implementing participative, collaborative leadership cultures.
In these companies, the well-being of the collaborator takes precedence, the results, the success and the financial results are the consequences.
And not the reverse.
We also reverse the hierarchical pyramid to replace managers with teams that make decisions together, collectively.
We are not at Les Careours, there are results to be achieved, there are objectives, but above all there is a vision and values that are shared by all.
We are at the wheel of his work.
I could cite several examples of success.
I&#39;m going to talk about a company that you&#39;re probably familiar with, given the average age here: it&#39;s Netflix, a Silicon Valley company.
They decided to set up an HR culture in which we will advocate responsibility and freedom.
Imagine: you are free to organize your work as you see fit, and where you see fit; we do not check your expense reports; we will not control the number of days off you take; you are simply being asked to do your best for the good of the company.
Isn&#39;t that a good response to the need for autonomy?
We ask you to take initiatives and we accept that you are wrong, because one does not go without the other.
This has the effect of creating a movement of innovation and [intrapreneurship] within the company.
I could cite other examples of success, but let&#39;s focus on the actors of these changes: who are they?
Obviously it&#39;s company directors and managers, but it&#39;s also each of you, each of your collaborators, each of your employees.
And to plagiarize Gandhi, I would say, “Be the change you want to see in your business. »
And to do this, it requires great human qualities, it requires developed emotional intelligence.
And by that I mean qualities like empathy, benevolence, listening, tolerance.
How to develop this emotional intelligence?
You will say to me: “Some are more gifted than others. »
And the good news tonight is that you are all endowed with these qualities.
They are part of your human nature.
They are parasitized on a daily basis by the various stresses that surround us.
It can be stresses that are physical - I challenge you to be kind to a dentist pulling out your tooth - emotional or mental.
And so you just have to let go of this stress to rediscover all these qualities and be able to unfold them around you.
Easy to say, but how to do it?
And this is where I would draw a parallel with the emergence in our society of mindfulness and meditation.
It is no coincidence that we see these tools emerge in hospitals, in schools, in companies, and even at the last world economic summit in Davos where each of the participants was offered a meditation session before start the day.
I could flaunt all the studies that demonstrate the correlation and positive impact of mindfulness on creativity and emotional intelligence.
I am going to propose to you this evening to rather experience a break of mindfulness, together.
I ask you to accept this exercise with that open mind that has brought you here today, without prejudice.
It&#39;s a tool that you can use at any time of the day, on the train, in a queue, in business before a meeting, and even during a TED talk.
Are you ready ?
So let&#39;s go.
I suggest you close your eyes, sit comfortably in your seat, feel the weight of your body on the seat, your feet on the floor, the weight of the clothes on your skin.
You feel the air blow on your face and on your hands.
Simply watch your breath.
Let go of all tensions, all ideas, all judgments.
Breathe.
Now turn your attention to the closest sounds.
Broaden your listening to the most distant sounds.
Just rest for a few moments here and now.
Breathe deeply, open your eyes, reconnect with the outside world, in this room, with your neighbors.
The world is changing.
Yesterday, in an industrial economy, headhunters were asked to recruit labour.
Today, in a knowledge economy, it is asked to recruit brains, diplomas.
I am convinced that artificial intelligence will give us access tomorrow to levels of knowledge such as we have never had until now.
I am convinced that artificial intelligence will give the patient a diagnosis that will be more relevant than that of our doctor X.
And what we will expect from our doctor X are his human qualities.
Because it is the human who will inspire others, it is the human who will bring new ideas, it is the human who will make the organizations and companies of tomorrow able to experience success.
And so we arrive in a humanist economy where the relational qualities of creativity and heart will be the selection criteria for headhunters.
I can therefore only encourage you all to cultivate and deploy these beautiful qualities that you possess to practice mindfulness without moderation or any other tool that will allow you to reconnect with your own humanity, with your own infinity.
Thanks and good job.
(Applause)
Beyond our solar system, there are planets that orbit other stars.
They are called exoplanets.
Exoplanets, because they are outside the solar system.
As you can imagine, it is really difficult to detect them because they are very far from us.
And yet, regularly, astronomers tell us that they have discovered new exoplanets.
There is even a recent study, which suggests that among all the exoplanets which must exist in our galaxy, there could be 20 billion of them, likely to have liquid water on their surface, and therefore to offer an environment potentially interesting for life.
You realize ?
20 billion!
Well if we want to study the criteria of the habitability of a planet, we will focus on four criteria that must be met for this study to be a success.
The first criterion is that the planet be at the right distance from the star.
In reality, the image you have on the screen is a drawing of an exoplanet.
Because they&#39;re way too far away, you can&#39;t see that level of detail.
But what the artist wanted to represent is a planet in the star&#39;s habitable zone.
That is to say, at the surface of which the temperature would be the right one so that the water can remain in the liquid state for a long enough time.
Closer to us, in the solar system, there are also planets that can tell us about habitability.
So of course, today, to our knowledge, there is only one that is habitable and inhabited, it is the Earth, since we are there, and the other candidates are rare.
Mars, which according to the models is or is not in the zone of habitability, and then satellites, giant planets, like Europa around Jupiter, and Enceladus, around Saturn.
There, it is the tidal forces that compensate for the lack of solar energy.
I&#39;m going to tell you about Mars, and the Curiosity mission, which recently established that one day this planet has met the criteria for habitability.
Curiosity landed on Mars in August 2012.
The animation you see shows you the entry into the atmosphere, the descent and the landing, which actually lasts seven minutes.
Seven minutes of terror, where the choreography must be executed perfectly, with very little margin for error.
Everything is pre-programmed.
We first use a heat shield, then a parachute to brake, then retro rockets, then a system of cranes, to land this 900 kg machine, precisely and gently on the surface of Mars.
The precision of the landing is a few kilometers, whereas we have just traveled hundreds of millions of kilometers between Earth and Mars, for nine months.
Incredible, right?
Curiosity is a NASA mission, piloted by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech University in California, with several international collaborations.
It took five years to build it.
And Curiosity sends us new images of Mars every day.
From now on I will show you real photos.
Like this one.
So of course, to the neophyte&#39;s eye, all images of Mars look alike.
Now, what do we see, what do you see?
We see pebbles, we see sand.
In short, Mars is a desert.
A very dry desert, even, if we compare it to terrestrial deserts.
But then, isn&#39;t there a contradiction with what I have just told you?
That Mars was an interesting planet to study habitability.
That the planet is the right distance from the sun to have liquid water.
Do you see liquid water?
It&#39;s a matter of atmosphere.
Today the atmosphere of Mars is so thin that you cannot have liquid water on its surface.
We do find ice in the subsoil, near the poles, we might find liquid water at great depths, but on the surface, today we have a desert.
At the same time, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard in the news, of researchers announcing that they&#39;ve found evidence that there was liquid water on the surface of Mars.
And indeed, in the past, there have been.
So my second criterion of habitability, after distance, will be time, geological time.
You have to be at the right time, to have the right atmosphere, which makes it possible to have liquid water on the surface of the planet.
I explain to you.
When planets form, they are initially extremely hot.
As the drawing on your left suggests.
In the case of the solar system, that was 4.6 billion years ago.
Then you can imagine the planets as being heat machines that cool down during their history.
So at some point, for some of them, the temperature may be adequate, and the atmosphere may be adequate, to have liquid water on its surface.
This was the case for the Earth and for Mars a little over 4 billion years ago.
This is seen in the middle drawing.
And we have accumulated, with space exploration, a lot of evidence that, indeed, there was water on Mars.
So of course, at the beginning of space exploration in the 60s, we killed the myth of the Martian, by revealing a desert planet.
But very soon after, in the 1970s, the images that came back to us from Mars showed canyons that looked like dried up riverbeds.
And even more recently, the various missions have shown us that the minerals that form rocks, some of these minerals, form in the presence of water.
We are therefore convinced that, indeed, in the distant past, Mars had liquid water on its surface.
And then the planet continued to evolve, with a lot of volcanism, its history diverged from Earth&#39;s, because it&#39;s smaller, and finally ended up with this photo you have on your right, which shows a planet with giant extinct volcanoes, immense canyons, and large expanses of desert.
So why are we interested in this planet?
Well precisely because, at one point in its history, there was water on the surface of Mars at the same time as there was water on the surface of the Earth.
And at that time, 3 or 4 billion years ago, life appeared on Earth.
We know very little about this part of our history, but inevitably we ask ourselves questions.
Is this a phenomenon unique to Earth?
What should be the conditions for this to happen elsewhere?
And that&#39;s why when you study habitability on another planet, you have to study the good era, the era when there was liquid water in its evolution, in its history.
Curiosity, like the other missions, has given us plenty of evidence that there was liquid water at its landing site.
And I have to tell you, the first time I saw this photo, I was working in California then, we were on Martian time.
It&#39;s a bit of a weird experience.
The first time I saw this photo, I thought it was a gag.
It could very well have been a sidewalk after an earthquake, something like that.
But in reality, the whole team was amazed by this image which came from Mars, and which showed us a conglomerate.
That is to say, a rock which is formed from fragments of rock which have been transported there, and cemented together.
And what is remarkable to the eye of the geologist is that these rock fragments are rounded.
A bit like pebbles if you will, little pebbles you would find at the bottom of a river.
And geologists are even able, with the shape of these rocks, to calculate the amount of water that has passed through there, and to tell you that there was a river there with a depth of a little less than one meter.
So obviously, we hadn&#39;t chosen the landing site by chance.
But this image revealed vividly that we had landed in what was once the delta of a river that flowed there several billion years ago.
Here, I show you this other image, another rock photographed by Curiosity a little further.
This flat rock was also formed in the presence of water.
In reality, there were already some on the 1st photo that I showed you, the one where we talked about the desert.
It is a sedimentary rock, that is to say that it is formed of very small fragments which have been transported by the wind or by rivers, and which in this case are deposited at the bottom of a lake to form this rock.
And then the water continued to flow through the fractures of the rock, as evidenced by the small clear vein which is located in the middle of the pebble.
And Curiosity is able to measure the composition of these rocks, with several instruments.
For example, ChemCam, the instrument I work with, uses a laser that will shoot at the rock, it will make a little spark, and to put it simply, the color of the spark tells us the chemical elements that are in the rock. rock.
And so, I can tell you that the composition of the vein is different from the composition of the rock, and that this vein is rich in sulphur.
It is an interesting element if I am interested in life.
There are others, like carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus.
In reality, the composition of the rocks will allow us to know under what conditions it was formed.
And beyond that, what was the environment of that region on Mars when that rock was formed.
What was the temperature?
Was the water acidic?
Was the atmosphere oxidizing?
What were the chemical elements that were present?
Were there those who are useful for life?
To answer all these questions, I will have to use all of Curiosity&#39;s instruments, because that forms my 3rd criterion of habitability.
It is not enough to be at the right distance from the star and to be at the right time to have liquid water, it is also necessary that I have the chemical environment which is welcoming, let&#39;s say, for the life.
And if possible, let it last long enough, because it will take time for life to evolve.
So here&#39;s Curiosity in its lake, which has been dry for some time.
This area has been called Yellowknife Bay.
It&#39;s a real photo, a selfie, one more.
Curiosity is a little over two meters wide, it is a little taller than me, it is equipped with about ten instruments, including two Franco-American instruments, ChemCam and Sam, which both measure the composition of rocks.
ChemCam is that laser I told you about, you can see its telescope at the top of the mast.
It will draw up a kind of chemical panorama around the robot.
And Sam, he will be able to make a very fine measurement of the composition, when we take a rock sample.
Well since the landing, hundreds of researchers and engineers take turns daily to operate, to make Curiosity work on the surface of Mars.
At the end of its day, the robot sends all these observations back to Earth via a relay satellite.
The international team takes it, discusses it, and decides what to do the next day, the activity plan.
Are we going to make a new measurement?
Are we going to move the robot?
We then program the on-board computer, which will run this program automatically the following day.
And so on.
It&#39;s a pretty great and fairly successful example of collaborative work, and I&#39;m lucky with a few colleagues, and with the help of CNES, to take part in it from here in Toulouse.
Curiosity is also equipped with a small drill, a small drill, I&#39;m going to zoom in on this photo, we can see the hole that was dug in the rock, which turns out to be clay, so a rock that s is formed in the presence of water too, and we notice that the powder of this rock has a different color, it is greyish, it is different from the color of the Martian surface which is red.
We can also see the marks that the laser left by sampling this rock powder.
Well, by bringing together all the results, from all these instruments, and the knowledge of all these researchers involved in this project, we have come to the conclusion that this region of Mars, when these rocks were formed, several billions of years, met the conditions for habitability.
Namely, that we had one or more episodes with water, perhaps for a few tens of thousands of years, that this water was soft, neutral pH, low salinity, and that we had the chemical elements , which could have been useful to microscopic life if it had been there.
We don&#39;t know how to answer this last question.
Habitability does not mean inhabited.
So we don&#39;t know, we don&#39;t have the elements to say whether there was life or not.
But we have the elements to say that the environment was favorable, was compatible.
So admit all the same that Mars seems a little less desert to us.
It&#39;s great, isn&#39;t it?
Let&#39;s take a little height with this photo.
This is a photo taken by a satellite orbiting Mars, of a region that is a little further south than the one I just showed you, which is called “the Kimberley”.
And Curiosity stopped, there too, we can see it elsewhere on the photo, it is there.
And maybe you also see the tracks his wheels left in the sand to get to this corner.
And so we continue our mission as geologists, to try to understand how the planet Mars works.
And also we continue to wonder about the habitability.
Besides, I told you about a 4th criterion, which is useful, interesting, when you want to study habitability.
And also, we could wonder, why we stopped at this place to make a new drilling, and why not elsewhere?
Well you will have understood, the information we are looking for is recorded in the rock.
So it&#39;s a solid record, but on the time scales that we&#39;re considering, that information may very well disappear.
And that&#39;s what happens on Earth, which is a geologically very dynamic planet.
So, I have this information in my rock, and I have to protect it.
And generally, it happens by covering this layer of interesting rock with another layer of rock or with sand.
But then, I have to rediscover this information, when I do my exploration.
And so, either you&#39;re able to dig deep enough, you&#39;re sort of doing archeology.
Either you let the erosion take place.
And that&#39;s what&#39;s happening here.
The wind has been blowing for millions of years, and has unearthed mounds of rock from the basement that are five meters high, the three mounds that you can see, which are therefore rocks that formed there is billions of years old, and therefore tell us what Mars was like at that time.
So there you have it, to conclude, while you contemplate this panorama which shows us the richness of the site explored by Curiosity, I just wanted to make you feel the quest for habitability.
To be at the right distance from the star, to be at the right time, to have the right environment, and to have preserved the information.
If you wanted to take an interest in life, you will also have to give time, when you have favorable conditions, for this life to evolve.
We are not there yet today, but a whole section of research continues to develop, to ask these questions, it is exobiology.
I would like you to realize, on the one hand, the multitude of options offered to us by all these planets.
And on the other hand, the beauty of the Earth which is habitable.
All that is accessible to us by the spirit, and the finitude of the cosmos accessible to Humanity.
So will you say to me: “What is it for? »
Well, yes, I am very often asked this question, what is it for?
And I answer you: “Nothing. »
Yes, because if the question is whether it will bring in money, and change my daily life, immediately, no.
However, remember the lesson left to us by Raymond Devos.
“Nothing is nothing. »
He had demonstrated that you could get something out of nothing by multiplying it.
He said: “Once nothing is nothing.
Two times nothing, it&#39;s not much.
But three times nothing...
We can already get something with next to nothing.
Is not it ? »
Well research is exactly that.
Basic research is about accumulating those little things that make us acquainted, a shared knowledge.
So of course, at the turn of a project like this, we also improve our technology, but above all, we exercise our ability to think, which is our asset.
We mobilize our knowledge to understand complex phenomena.
So, ladies and gentlemen, please continue to intoxicate yourselves with curiosity.
(Applause)
Good evening.
I&#39;m going to re-enter, actually.
(Laughs) Good evening to you!
(Applause) Good evening, so my topic is: Taking Advantage of Vice.
The subject seems a bit pompous, so I&#39;m going to start with something very down to earth: a photo of my grandmother, Monique alias Mamou, in fact.
My story begins two years ago, when Monique gave me a book on social entrepreneurship, a book by Muhammad Yunus.
Like many, I loved this book for two things: one, social entrepreneurship, it&#39;s great to undertake not to maximize profits, but to solve social problems, and secondly, I liked my race, the fact that, precisely, we can see the positive in everything he did.
That&#39;s what he does, Muhammad, he sees the positive in everything he describes, even capitalism.
Suddenly, it pushed me to try to think of ideas to respond to the problems caused by capitalism.
Today the economic system in which we are, it works, it is perfect like Jessica Alba, no it&#39;s a joke.
Try to laugh for jokes.
There are a few flaws, a few problems, some left behind in the system.
Growing inequalities, environmental problems, pollution, mass unemployment, etc.
Besides that, there are also excessive things.
For example, there are budgets that are excessive.
In particular one, which for me was really excessive, was advertising.
I leave you two seconds to read this sentence.
One. Two.
What is great about this sentence is that it is in the film 99 Francs and it really puts two parts of capitalism in opposition.
On the one hand what is in excess, that is to say the advertising budgets, budgets which are colossal.
Advertising in itself is not negative.
It creates desire, promotes a product.
It&#39;s not unhealthy in itself.
It is still a budget that is excessive.
The other part of the sentence really shows the flaws of capitalism, which it cannot quite fill.
North-South inequalities, for example.
We finally realize that with this phenomenal budget, less than half would make it possible to eliminate hunger in the world.
This shows a real gap between the two.
I said to myself: why no longer see them in opposition but try to connect them?
Create a tool that allows you, a bit like Robin Hood, to create a link that diverts part of the excessive advertising budget to fill one of these loopholes.
I started thinking, etc.
I ended up having an idea.
She arrived at a somewhat unexpected moment, in the shower in fact.
There are two places to think, in the shower and in the toilet.
I was more in the shower.
I found this idea, I was really happy.
Today this idea has turned into a start-up called Goodeed.
We are raising funds today, we are 4 people.
THANKS.
(Applause) Tristan and Thomas are in the room.
Thomas couldn&#39;t come because of car problems.
Tristan is Goodeed&#39;s web designer, he&#39;s in the room.
This really cool idea, what is it?
This is a free donation website.
You go to this site, you choose a donation, a vaccine, a tree or a meal.
Then you watch a commercial.
The money generated by the ad finances his donation.
It is a free gift for the Internet user.
This is the first side.
The 2nd, not for the user, but for the advertiser, the one I want to go into tonight, is to show that what is in excess in capitalism, a budget seen as excessive, as something negative in the end, is now re-humanized.
We gave a new meaning to advertising.
Advertising budgets have been allowed to regain meaning and utility.
Today Goodeed has helped finance meals for 18,000 children for one month with the WFP in Kenya.
And that, just thanks to your donations, there were more than 500,000, and thanks to advertising.
Finally, what can be seen as negative, can also be positive.
You just have to create a tool, try to innovate to transform it into something positive.
And that the Chinese have been doing for millennia.
It&#39;s in their vocabulary.
Crisis in Chinese is &quot;Weiji&quot;.
&quot;Wei&quot;, which is the danger.
The first symbol is a man threatening someone else with a knife.
It doesn&#39;t show like that, but that&#39;s it.
The second symbol is opportunity, occasion.
It&#39;s “Ji”.
It shows that in the most critical situations, we can bounce back.
We see the positive in the negative.
Thanks to a situation that destabilizes us, we will be stimulated, see other things, differently, in a young way.
I came to tell you this tonight: try to see things frozen, like advertising, it&#39;s necessarily an excessive, negative budget, there are flaws in capitalism.
We can see them differently and try to create links by innovating.
So there you have it, create companies that have this social aspect in their DNA.
Good evening, thank you very much.
(Applause)
According to the World Health Organization, the world lacks 100 million liters of blood to meet the needs of the world&#39;s population.
In addition, the French Blood Establishment informs us that 90% of French people know that donating blood saves lives.
And despite this figure, they are only 4% to carry out this gesture every year.
And this scenario is repeated in most industrialized countries.
Faced with this discrepancy between human blood donations and the needs of the world population, we must find an alternative to this practice, in order to respond to this real public health problem.
And, surprising as it may seem, I may have found one of the solutions.
And the solution, I found it on a beach in Brittany.
Already very small, I was fascinated by the oceans, and I think that the emissions of the commander Cousteau were not foreign there.
So I naturally decided to make it my job, and I became a doctor in marine biology.
An environment caught my attention very early on, because this environment was colonized by very old organisms.
That environment is the foreshore, or a scientific name for an environment that you have to enjoy because, in fact, it&#39;s the beach.
And the beach in Brittany is covered twice a day by the tide.
And the sand of this beach is home to very old organisms that you have certainly seen, by the traces that these organisms leave on the sand, by depositing your towel there.
In fact, these traces testify to the presence of a marine organism called the lugworm.
So the lugworm is the name of a sea worm very well known on the beaches in Brittany whose name in Breton is the Buzuc.
So I became interested in this marine worm to answer questions of respiratory ecophysiology.
So what does that mean?
Oh, it&#39;s simple, I was interested in the breathing of this sea worm.
I was actually trying to figure out how this worm breathed between high tide and low tide.
And in order to answer this fundamental research question, (Laughs) I became interested in the blood of this animal.
Indeed, blood is an extremely interesting biological fluid.
It is the interface between the physiology of an organism and its environment.
In fact, the blood is made up of different cells, but the molecule that carries oxygen, the oxygen that is essential for all living organisms, which is a bit - if I took an example related to mechanics - oxygen, c It&#39;s a bit like the fuel you&#39;re going to put in your vehicle.
Without fuel, it&#39;s running out of fuel.
And without oxygen, death is certain.
In fact, blood contains a type of cell called red blood cells.
Red blood cells are a small vehicle that will transport gas to the cells of your body.
And to be more precise, this molecule contains a protein called hemoglobin.
Hemoglobin is a molecule that is capable of reversibly binding oxygen.
And what was my surprise, to discover that the blood of this marine worm here present had no red corpuscles.
Oh, I must be honest, at the start of my discovery, I did not know the extent of this work.
But [my discovery] came to the ears of a learned club, which is called the Club du Globule Rouge.
(Laughs) So I was invited to Paris, to a Parisian hospital to present my research work to an audience of doctors and hematologists.
And at the end of my scientific lecture, several of them came down to the bottom of the amphitheater and asked me the following questions: &quot;But sir, you did not find this molecule which has this structure, which has this function ? »
“Well, yes! »
“But we have been researching this molecule for more than 40 years to make it a universal blood substitute! »
You and I have an ABO blood group, Rhesus positive or Rhesus negative.
Only negative O is a universal donor type.
The absence of red blood cells in this animal gave this molecule a universal character.
And back in the laboratory, in order to test this hypothesis, I hastened to go to the beach to collect a few hundred lugworms, quite simply to try to collect the hemoglobin contained in their circulatory system, and after purification of this molecule by conventional laboratory techniques, I hastened to transfuse rodents.
And what was my surprise, after exsanguination of these laboratory animals to more than 80%, I transfused this molecule to these animals, and nothing happened.
(Laughter) The organisms, these rodents, lived on sea worm hemoglobin.
An astonishing discovery, and today a huge hope for medicine.
A snub to all those skeptics who asked me the question: &quot;But what&#39;s the point of studying the breathing of a sea worm?&quot;
(Laughs) You really don&#39;t have other things to do in a CNRS laboratory? »
(Laughs) In order to support this research work, I am forced to leave the CNRS to create a biotechnology company which will be responsible for developing these molecules for medical applications.
And it only takes a few hundred grams of lugworms to make a globular type pouch.
The applications of this molecule are numerous.
For what ?
Well, quite simply because oxygen is at the center of all biological and physiological processes, and therefore, ultimately, of life.
The first years of the creation of this company, I spent them developing an industrial process for the production of my marine worms.
Indeed, being a biologist, it was out of the question for me to defaune all the beaches in Brittany.
And today, these worms are produced in aquaculture, in a totally controlled and traced environment.
Several hundred tons of this animal are produced in aquaculture.
Apart from the worm, the raw material, the biomass, it was also necessary to find an industrial production system for the extraction of these molecules under pharmaceutical conditions.
And today, we actually have a whole process that extracts molecules from biomass.
From this industrial process and the production of marine worms, the applications are extremely numerous.
And I&#39;m going to name three of them, but there are a lot of them.
First is the blood transfusion.
You know, when you donate blood, a bag of blood can be kept for 42 days, because red blood cells are perishable.
In addition, the cold chain must be maintained at 4°C.
I remind you that this molecule is not contained in a red blood cell.
And it is thus possible to obtain freeze-dried blood, that is to say powdered blood, which can be put back into solution using pharmaceutical water.
So no more storage problem.
No more storage problems at 4°C.
This product could be quickly available in emergency areas, in disaster areas, where we really need to transfuse patients.
This product is currently in development thanks to a partnership that we have with the American army.
The second application is healing.
So not just any kind of wound.
Wounds that we will find in people who suffer from diabetes, which we call diabetic foot syndrome, people who suffer from bedsores, severe burns, all these wounds have the characteristic of healing poorly.
For what ?
Well simply because the blood circulation is bad.
And unfortunately, the wounds that we will find in people suffering from diabetes generally end badly since most of these people are amputated.
And this affects 20 million people around the world.
We were able to show that dressings impregnated with this molecule were able to deliver oxygen to the feet, and therefore to these wounds, and therefore, ultimately, to prevent amputation.
The third of these applications, which is now the most successful since a human trial will take place at the end of the year, is organ transplantation.
In France, 500 people die each year from a lack of grafts on a waiting list of 19,000 patients.
For what ?
Because in fact, the solutions we use today in clinics are only made up of water and salt, but no oxygen carriers.
When an organ is removed from a donor, it is immediately disconnected from the bloodstream.
And we were able to show that by using this molecule, it was possible to considerably increase the conservation time of a graft.
A heart today takes four hours, between collection from the donor and the moment when it is going to be transplanted into the recipient.
A kidney is 12 hours.
With this molecule, today, we have been able to double the preservation time of these organs and multiply by four the preservation time of a kidney.
So, today, we are able to increase the pool of grafts available for transplantation.
Research is progressing, but it is not progressing as quickly as we would like.
For what ?
Because the drug cycle is long, very long, very, very long, and while waiting for the marketing of our product, which could save millions of lives around the world, I can only urge you to give your blood.
Show generosity to save lives.
And a little advice between friends, go quickly, because tomorrow, it could be a gesture from another time.
THANKS.
(Applause)
I come back from Agadez, in Niger.
Agadez, perhaps some know, was the pearl of the Sahara, the gateway to the desert, the blessed stage of the Paris-Dakar.
Today there is not a single tourist since the kidnappings of 2010.
On the other hand, there are migrants, hundreds and hundreds of migrants from West Africa.
The mayor confided to me: in the season favorable to migration, the population of the city triples.
In 2 weeks when it will be less hot.
39° instead of 45.
For those crossing the Sahara in the back of pick-ups to Libya, that counts.
So you&#39;re going to tell me: not yet stories of migrants, we only hear that.
What if I answered you that in fact, we don&#39;t talk about it at all anymore.
We are only talking about refugees.
Those you are shown on TV are Syrians, Iraqis.
They are fleeing a war.
We were told that they are doctors, lawyers, that at home they have a big house, a cleaning lady.
They are a bit like us, they are white.
I cover Africa for Le Point magazine.
And the ones I started following in June are the ones we don&#39;t want at home.
They are poor, not very educated, they are black.
They will never have refugee status.
They will always be confined to that of migrant on the move.
When the Syrians take a few weeks to reach Europe, they take several years.
Many remain stuck in Libya.
Some are murdered there for no reason.
Many die on the way to the Sahara.
The desert is littered with corpses.
The idea came to me in April: I was queuing up at an after-sales service for my computer.
A nice pensioner came to sit next to me, looking for company.
She asked me what my job was.
So I told him: reporter in Africa.
She said to me: “My poor thing, it must not be funny. »
I tell him: “No, I like it. »
“I don&#39;t understand why these people come to us.
There is no job for them.
They come for benefits?
Afterwards they sleep on my landing and they smell strong. »
So I said to her: “Madam, I know where they come from and you would do the same. »
My ticket number was finally out, I got up, draped in my dignity, and then afterwards I asked myself: do we really know why these people are leaving?
Those who do not flee a war.
Are they really better with us?
So I looked for a country whose inhabitants would flee en masse and which would not be at war.
It wasn&#39;t very difficult, the International Organization for Migration had just released a report, and the country whose greatest number of nationals in absolute terms had attempted to cross the Mediterranean between January and March 2015 was Gambia.
More than Syria, more than Nigeria.
Nigeria has 175 million inhabitants.
The Gambia: 1.9.
Very small country.
It was a general rescue.
I wanted to understand.
Of course, there were clues: a dictator who arrived in a coup d&#39;etat in 94, Yaya Jammeh -- claims that he can cure AIDS thanks to a drink made from plants and verses from the Koran, which makes his opponents, when they are not shot in public.
There were the economic indicators: 1700 dollars of GDP per capita, which places the country 210th out of 230.
Human development.
they are 172nd out of 187.
In short, misery.
Once there, I realized that it was even more complicated.
It&#39;s always like that.
We always discover on the spot.
It was a mixture of poverty, ignorance, hope, social pressure that pushed young people to leave.
And there was absolutely nothing that could dissuade them.
That&#39;s why I followed the path, I went to Agadez, the migration hub.
And that&#39;s why I want to talk to you this evening about everything we think we know about migrants and which is absolutely false.
First misconception: it is very expensive to cross; with all that money, couldn&#39;t they have done anything else?
Build a box?
Well no.
Because they don&#39;t leave with all the money they need for their trip, they don&#39;t have it.
They work on the way.
Take the example of Jamal Barry, 25, met in Gambia, near Serekunda.
Djamal makes furniture.
When I met him, his last order dated back a month: two armchairs, a 2-seater sofa, a 3-seater sofa.
Paid 450 dalasis by his boss.
9 euros for 12 working days.
Djamal&#39;s parents are dead, he has 4 brothers and sisters, he wanted to send money from Europe, and then like many, he had to stop in Libya.
He had no money at all.
He had been extorted at the checkpoint of all the countries crossed.
So, Senegal, Mali, Burkina, Niger, Libya.
And then he was kidnapped.
And then he got sick.
So he came back after 8 months.
He still drew me the truck on which the Tuaregs bring migrants to the Sahara.
You can see, these are cages set up to store as much as possible.
He was sitting at the end of a beam.
He had to hold on so he wouldn&#39;t fall because the truck wouldn&#39;t stop.
At the start of the ride, they were tight.
And less and less, because they dumped the bodies of those who were dying of dehydration in the desert.
He said to me: “Every day, I will go back there because here, I am already dead. »
Second misconception.
They are disloyal.
They abandon their countries which need these living forces.
It&#39;s exactly the opposite: they leave to help the family.
In Africa, there is no pension insurance.
Children ensure the old days of their parents.
Take the case of this gentleman, Balamin Jaiteh.
The photo he is holding in his hands is that of his son, Yankuba.
Yankuba was 23 when he tried the trip, he too thought he was going to Europe, he too had to stop at Sebha, in Libya.
And he was unlucky.
Libyans were looking for an African from his ghetto.
These are the houses where migrants pile up before they can continue.
He told them he didn&#39;t know where he was.
He was told: “You are lying, you blacks all know each other. »
They doused him with gasoline.
They struck a match.
Yankuba burned to death.
His father took days to kindly talk to me, he felt guilty.
He said to me: “Me too, I did that, as early as 1975.
I worked in Mali, Burkina-Faso, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Niger and Libya.
It&#39;s normal to help his old parents, besides all the time he could work, he sent us money; you see, we were able to redo the house. »
His wife stared at the floor.
One of her daughters had gone into hiding to cry.
When I asked Balamin: &quot;You forbade your sons to leave?&quot;
You told them it was dangerous?
he said to me: “No, not clearly. »
For the moment, it is not a source of money which he can deprive himself of.
Third misconception.
They&#39;re not that poor, they have cell phones.
So, yes, they have cell phones, sometimes they only have that.
No electricity, no running water but smartphones.
Not state-of-the-art, old imitations that take hours to load, hours to display a web page.
Because the most formidable smuggler, the most lying, is not the little starving kid from Agadez who piles up migrants in the back of his pick-up.
No, it&#39;s the internet.
These are social networks.
They spend hours dreaming in front of the photos of those who have already been to Europe, and dreaming that one day they will also be able to cross.
Fourth misconception.
They will all sweep over France to nab family allowances.
No, it&#39;s borderline vexing, I know, but not one spoke of France.
At the bus station in Niamey, the capital of Niger, I spoke with a Malian who insisted on speaking to me in English, because his boss was from Nigeria, so an English speaker, he wanted to practice his English.
He was aiming for Europe, but not France at all.
England or especially Germany.
Even the Senegalese in the ghettos of Agadez, they dream of Germany, they don&#39;t even know that French isn&#39;t spoken there.
As for allowances, no one knows that it exists.
Let&#39;s take a short detour to Kenya.
I present to you Farhiyo Salah, 22 years old.
Farhiyo grew up in the biggest refugee camp in the world, on the border with Somalia, it&#39;s called Dadaab.
Today there are 350,000 people.
When I met her in July, she had just obtained a scholarship to study in Canada.
She told me: “All my life I have been assisted by NGOs, now I want to have my job, earn my own money, become independent.
Like that, I will come back, and I will change the condition of women in Africa. »
Farhiyo wants to become a diplomat or a gynecologist, not have 8 children at Canada&#39;s expense.
Finally, 5th received idea: there are too many problems at home, they will always dream of Europe.
There is nothing to do.
Yes and no.
Europe is indeed this place from which the brothers write: “Just come, there is work here.” but for most of those I spoke to, if they had had the choice, they would have done as previous generations: they would have migrated within Africa, and in particular to Libya.
The first time Ousmane Sawo, 38, went to Libya was in 2008.
He stayed for two and a half years.
He was a mason.
He earned around 200 euros a month.
He was able to build his house in Gambia.
It became too dangerous, one of his friends died before his eyes.
He has returned.
In 2013, there was no money at all.
He told himself that he would do like everyone else and try to go to Italy.
As a boat, he found himself in prison for 6 months in Tripoli, because of a scam by his smuggler.
Ousmane, today, earns in Gambia, the days when he has work, 4 euros.
Just for the children&#39;s schooling and food, he spends 3.
He said to me: “I only have to make a tea at home to exceed my budget.
Every day that God makes, I pray that none of my children will get sick, because I couldn&#39;t get them treated. »
As the Senegalese of Agadez told me: “Madam, we have to cross, because things are not going well in Libya. »
They said to me: “Madame, the worst thing is to die poor.
So we have no choice. »
Even if they are afraid, even if they have seen the images of shipwrecks on France 24.
They said to me: “Madam, death is nothing, we try our luck. »
That&#39;s why closing the borders will never do any good.
Because as long as these young Africans do not have the hope of a better life, of a life at all, at home, they will continue to come.
And you see, we too would do the same.
THANKS.
(Applause)
