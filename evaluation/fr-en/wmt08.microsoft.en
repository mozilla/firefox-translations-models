Inflation in Europe has slipped on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, price increases in the 13 eurozone countries were larger than expected, after an inflation rate of 2.6 percent in October, annual inflation of 3.1 percent was recorded, said the statistical office of the European Community in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, UK and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the key interest rate, saying that falling interest rates, together with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, this is Catch 22 for the ECB: "we must dissuade" inflation so that we no longer have to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 percent is a record in the last twelve years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has taken off due to rapidly rising food and energy prices.
Cereal futures market prices rose 88 percent and soybean prices also reached their highest value since 1973.
The price of edible oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the global price of oil has risen by 52 percent, and last month a barrel of oil cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, in the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut the key interest rate twice in 2008.
Gallup reports a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) increased significantly at the beginning of December. Since 2002, he now has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup has never before seen such low socialist support, at 13 percent.
For loyal voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of opposition voters, support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of one-fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent among the entire population.
Of the voters loyal to vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate from the previous low, the proportion of those who considered the country's economic situation to be particularly serious has never been higher, it stands at 41 per cent and according to a further 46 per cent the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of last spring and summer, families are once again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population expects a worsening and only a tenth predicts an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71 percent of those surveyed, a majority never seen in previous Gallup polls, felt the prime minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the prime minister at all and 27 percent the president of Fidesz.
One indicator of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society that thinks that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be addressed without a change of government.
While after last October's riots, 35 per cent of respondents wanted the government and the prime minister to remain in office, currently the rate is only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believe that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
When asked about voting intention, 60 percent of respondents said they would definitely vote and the 20 percent said they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "parliamentary election to be held next Sunday", only 55 percent of respondents would certainly participate and 15 percent complementary would probably participate. According to current intentions, the result of the referendum would be beyond doubt.
74 per cent of people would say no to higher education fees, 79 per cent would say no to consultation fees and 84 per cent would say no to hospital fees.
When we look only at the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital stay fees.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
Hypermarkets in the Budaörs shopping triangle maintained last year's average price increase of 16 percent, with the difference that this year the VAT rate did not increase.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economy)
This year, in the Budaörs shopping triangle, the usual daily Christmas Basket also increased by 16 percent on average, with an increase in value well over a thousand forints in all hypermarkets.
Prices, "which had already soared" in large food stores last December, have not risen sharply compared to the previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased well below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The Daily Basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was HUF 6,800.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained close to last year's level, but prices for turkey fillet, walnuts and poppies rose sharply.
In the shops, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, we found bread of one kilo at only 139 forints.
Competition has not lowered the price of the product below HUF 200.
It was astonishing to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of a two-litre returnable bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints per returnable bottle included.
It only prevents this year, in terms of daily basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its Daily Basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 percent and 18 percent respectively.
Comparing last year's most expensive basket and this year's cheapest basket, we see a gap of 12 percent while the difference between last year's cheapest and this year's most expensive is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of 1,480 forints.
Last year, prices increased by an average of 1,206 forints, although the impact of the increase in the VAT rate was already noticeable in last year's Christmas prices.
This process puzzled trade, hypermarkets could not visibly determine what margin to apply on products as they were unable to predict the impact of price changes on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the turnover of a product, he risks losing a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Because of the change in the VAT rate, the increase in the prices of the Daily Basket has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006 while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive since the value of the most expensive basket was 1,630 forints higher than last year and the prices of the cheapest one increased by 1,284 forints as well.
Bringing the two Christmas seasons closer together, we have seen a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumer items have increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH's data: for some essential power supplies, the statistics institute found a price increase of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and eggs.)
According to the latter's Daily Basket, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 percent compared to the baseline.
According to the indices, flour suppliers occupy a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to get the sharp price increase accepted by multinationals as well.
In the commercial golden triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
In our experience, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take the shelf-stable food by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, large queues formed at the checkouts of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the turnover is lower in the provinces, many multinationals complain to the survey companies that they do not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer items.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, caused mainly by the incorrect use of antibiotics, were recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overwork of medical staff do not help to block infections, says the chief doctor of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also save on disinfectants
Not long ago an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was detected in a man hospitalized following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured man in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital but shortly afterwards he had to return because of an MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have not been able to perform a major operation on him because of the bacteria in his system.
As of December 10 this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by a multidrug-resistant pathogen have been reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, chief medical officer of the National Epidemiology Center.
Namely that it is the number of infections caused by a multidrug-resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
One-third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
Infections caused by AS (such as tonsillitis, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which responds well to antibiotics, will develop a bacterium that is well resistant to antibiotics that will grow rapidly in poor hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or sepsis, in elderly patients, of low weight or with a weakened organism.
According to the director of Hospital János, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily life of hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is not found only there or we do not look for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
AS is resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, health workers put on rubber gloves and protective masks and we have suitable antibiotics to treat them," Nyulasi said.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, however the infection can not always be avoided.
Sample collection is not fashionable
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions and circumstances in Hungarian hospitals are not favourable to prevent the development and proliferation of multidrug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and seniors' residences, hospitals should monitor inpatients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these examinations.
Most cases only develop if MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief physician of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has rigorous recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are Hungarian guidelines also for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient and basic care, Böröcz said.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA proliferates from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put on gloves and protective masks. However, significant shortcomings are detected in hospitals also in this area.
MRSAs proliferate through infection transmitted by droplet inhalation and contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other while in terms of epidemic, the sick should be distant from each other of at least 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, we also see that hospitals, in difficult financial situations, are saving money on disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many patients, so the risk of contamination is even greater," said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals where preventive measures are observed, the number of infections is demonstrably lower or the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenses for the social security funds, which is why this infection is being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this programme is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) identifies as one of its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens (such as MRSA) as well as the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The commissioner, author of a fatal accident, was not intoxicated
The official report relating to the fatal accident caused by the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement has been drawn up.
It can be excluded that the commissioner of the 22nd district, resigning from his post since, who ran over a pedestrian causing his death last Tuesday, would have driven drunk or stunned, said Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman for the public prosecutor of the capital after the report was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation which already found that the former commissioner had not consumed alcohol before getting behind the wheel.
Last Tuesday, the former head of the police station of the 22nd arrondissement ran over a 55-year-old man who was in front of him when he turned, with his personal car, in the street Kossuth Lajos of the 22nd arrondissement. The man wanted to cross the road without going through the crosswalk.
(By the way, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the crosswalk is not a mitigating circumstance, according to the Highway Traffic Act a car that initiates a turn must let pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being taken to hospital.
Following this accident, the commissioner resigned from his post and asked for his retirement because, according to the police communication, this accident upset him a lot.
The investigation into this case is being conducted by the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the magistrates in charge of conducting the investigation.
An additional €400 million for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice-President Marta Gajecka signed three agreements worth a total of €400 million for a credit line in Budapest on Friday in Budapest to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environment projects from the Cohesion Fund, for which a credit agreement worth EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties. This time, the signed contract concerns the use of the remaining €200 million.
The agreement on the EUR 150 million appropriation also concerns the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a contract worth 50 million euros for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope primarily in the framework of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the metro line 4 project was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would discuss the possible modification of the original contract again once Hungary has finalised the details of the metro financing with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has provided a total of EUR 8.4 billion to finance 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its loans according to the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without commitment fees.
Bulgaria, a paradise for the EU real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of all Europe is turned to this Balkan country little mentioned in the past.
What, or and who buys on this EU market that is always the cheapest but will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most fashionable target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and cheap seaside houses.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sands", the "Sun Coast", the former Sozopol and Nessebar but they are more and more looking for a building in the region of Kavarna and Balcik also.
According to analysts at Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also arouse the interest of investors and they are also more and more numerous to buy in the cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, with retail and office space promising the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer season and the winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a property in Bulgaria are at the same time looking to change their lives, their way of life.
Most buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the shores of the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet a lot of Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers fall into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price varying between 50 and 100 thousand euros, or old dilapidated houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, proximity to a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of second homes (since last December, Bulgaria has been cited among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is composed of commercial investors who buy in the hope of realizing a capital gain in the medium or long term.
The price of buildings in the capital is constantly increasing due to increasing demand.
In the European Union, property prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last 5 years, they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices essentially exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Hungarian six percent
According to the communication of Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meetings of the professionals end on Tuesday, however, on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap, which is supposed to define efforts beyond the Kyoto Protocol's emission reduction period until 2012.
At the moment, lively discussions are taking place on this subject between developing and developed countries.
The United States also indicated that, for the time being, it did not wish to discuss exact figures, while it was ready to sign an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020.
Another important topic of the conference is to see if developed countries commit, apart from reducing emissions, to provide financial and technological assistance to countries that need it.
An agreement was also signed on aid to be provided to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member board of directors, probably within the framework of the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), Piac és Profit (Market and Profit) reported.
Hungary's six percent
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role as flagship in global efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by 2020 compared to the level reached in 1990, regardless of the successful signing of the "Post-2012 Agreement", and is ready to reduce them by up to 30% if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries are also ready to make commitments. adapted to their responsibility and abilities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the signatory countries of the Kyoto Protocol had targeted a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members at that time made the commitment on 8 per cent less.
Hungary has made the commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the level of the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfill its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed until after 2012. In this case, reduction commitments below the Kyoto Protocol values would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the need for which has been highlighted in the new report by IPCC, the international scientific body, which won the UN Nobel Peace Prize on climate change.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the Earth of more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
British Army units share recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan on the video-sharing site in order to make themselves popular.
First, it was the British Air Force (RAF) that became passionate about YouTube: special units operating in Afghanistan upload video footage of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken using miniature helmet-mounted cameras, are checked at Air Force Operations Headquarters in Kandahar and then transferred to London where compatriots upload them to the Internet.
The political message is inescapable
The soldiers of the air force have already passed 139 sequences on the net by this way and their "channel" has been watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and provides videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the initial purpose of the air force, the videos were passed on the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they also served to make known to the general public the real objectives of the army's presence abroad.
The propaganda published through this channel costs virtually nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements on television, Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant, told the BBC. On the other hand, it also inevitably carries a political message since it justifies in a special form the merits of the military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game
The army is embetted because, apart from carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos are passed on the sharing site that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, officers do not avoid talking about casualties but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
Moreover, many videos were already on the net presenting the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out in real mission, but the British army is only getting excited about the loading of these videos recently.
Americans recruit a little differently using the free downloadable shootout game America's Army. In this game the player can put himself directly in the place of the soldiers in a more or less real simulation.
Christmas raffle and donuts in the ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold an end-of-year meeting with her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 by having donuts and coffee.
Another ministry will organize a party with live music, yet another will delight officials with a raffle and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so entertains power.
Public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defence but it is not the employees of the Ministry who will be invited.
At Christmas, Orphans, the children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for the missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also be held.
The Ministry provides a budget of 25 million forints to create the atmosphere at the end of the year.
In comparison with other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM festival will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, of the six hundred employees wholesale, three hundred and fifty are expected there.
During this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be de rigueur, there will be actors and also a raffle.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was held on Wednesday in the National Council for Justice (ILO) building with concerts and dinner.
The rental of the hall cost one million forints, the rest was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, an NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas party which is organized with European money by the National Center for Economic Development, the company managing the tenders.
The building of the Théâtre de la Gaîté was rented for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have not been able to reach the person in charge.
Costume is not mandatory
The ILO building housed not only the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, organized a ball on the occasion of Saint Luca's Day, 7 December.
The ILO did not charge them for the use of its rooms.
This ball had five hundred people.
The party began with the Minister's words of welcome and dinner was followed by a dance party to live music.
Answer to [origo]'s question: evening wear was not at all obligatory at this ball.
The ministries of health, labour and local government are preparing a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, within its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite his collaborators to a Christmas party but has an end-of-year working meeting.
One hundred and eighty people are expected who will be invited to have a coffee and eat donuts, said the press service, the party will cost only 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister for Local Government, will simply invite his colleagues to have a drink in the aula of the Ministry of Local Government and Spatial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas party in its large hall at which 436 employees are expected.
He plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest, including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees have celebrated Christmas every year in the same way.
No party atmosphere planned, the official character is reinforced not only by the minister's presentation but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will hold a reception on January 20 to celebrate the New Year, the Christmas party will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Wood, and according to the ministry's communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are opened by a few words of welcome from the Minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas at all, the respective press services have communicated to [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the party organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike come together
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will constitute, Friday, their strike commission which will be responsible for coordinating the strike of indefinite duration of Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the law on health funds, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause major traffic jams because rail traffic will be almost completely stopped and the employees of BKV (public transport company) will also strike until 1pm.
The league unions will make known, Friday afternoon, the details of their strike on Monday, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The strike commission of LIGA - MOSZ will also be constituted, it will serve as coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and, from Monday, the organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the law on health funds, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the law on health funds, the unions will immediately withdraw the strike call.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the follow-up.
According to Monday's agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the law on health funds will take place only late at night, or even at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, major traffic jams are expected: the railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of the public transport in Budapest and more than half of the Volán companies are likely to be stopped.
At the same time, at different points of the country, half of the track will be blocked as well.
Many unions and civil organizations have joined the call for the strike, the list of these is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations report striking for an indefinite period, others have declared a temporary work stoppage.
Until Thursday afternoon, the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) have not managed to reach an agreement on minimum services, but as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people take the train.
According to current communications, public transport in Budapest will strike from the start of service until 1 p.m., Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the League's Industrial Electricity and Thermal Energy Unions will strike for four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Democratic Teachers' Union have called for strikes for 2 hours and from 2 a.m. to 8 a.m. respectively.
The National Association of Doctors will strike throughout the country alternately, the Union of Health and Social Sector Employees (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will issue a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands, formulated by the League, demands that the government withdraw its proposal for health reform and submit a new conception to the social debate.
The second demand requires that the new method of calculating the pension to be introduced from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third demand is a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, which would allow the functions that deserve it to be transferred to the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), attached to the Unions of the League, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard has increased country risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary), increases the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
In its "risk warning", the company points out that, in connection with the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that "in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes may occur as a result of the aggravation of the already existing ethnic tension between the gypsy and non-gypsy population of Hungary".
The research institute added that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard presumably aimed at provoking this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed on the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings who have based a political strategy on the dispute between Gypsies and Hungarians".
This aggravates the problem, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and aggressive conflicts are more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, as a result of the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated Hungary's image abroad, in particular with regard to confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country".
They recall that, following greater publicity given to the reorganization of radical and extreme right Hungarian groups since autumn 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 calling themselves "National Self-Defence Association".
"The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civilian organization while they publicly declare the preparation of their members for defense missions (disasters, national defense, defense of order), armed if necessary, moreover, evoking the ineptitude of the police, the army, in other words the state," they added.
They pointed out that everything was happening according to the method which, based on the rancour of political society and parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions under a civilian aspect.
The emphasis on civil character and association status therefore only serves to avoid the legal pitfalls of registering these associations in court, but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and ultranationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries wish to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in East Central Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The numerous Roma disturbances that broke out in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) led to the constitution of the Bulgarian Guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the BNU decided to form a guard saying that the objective of the organization is "national self-defense".
According to them, over the past 17 years, gypsies have "terrorized" Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had provoked lively debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organisations about forming their own guard as a form of resistance signals the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, reads the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the telegraph agency's request for information, Attila Juhász, research director of Political Capital, said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published annually and if events occur that could have an impact on the change in risk, they inform public opinion, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days, the number of which will decrease next year.
The holidays are not uniform in the EU and in the US either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes between national and state holidays and rest days.
Rest days are often linked to religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the New Year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the New Year are also days of rest, the latter especially so that the awakeners can rest quietly.
In addition, in a year, we have a total of eleven holidays marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday, in commemoration of the revolution of 1848, as well as October 23, which is the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, May 1 is the feast of work and on November 1 and 2, we remember our family members and friends who have passed away.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize the working days in cases where there is only one working day before or after the holiday marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of long weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday before the long weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has ruled in a special regulation on the days of replacement of the days before or after the holidays.
The law extends to all employers and all their employees employees, to civil servants and to persons working in the public service.
However, it does not apply to service companies, institutions operating without interruption and in service, by their vocation, and also to rest days.
This year, the working days will be modified only around the end of the year holidays: from December 24, life stops almost throughout the country because according to experience the majority of people work overtime or take holidays that they have saved for these purposes to be able to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or at the end of the week, therefore there will be less change in working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized the first time around the work day to allow employees to stay at home four days in a row.
Saturday, April 25 will be a working day to have a rest day on Friday, May 2.
Another change is planned for October 23: Saturday, October 18 will be a replacement working day for Friday, October 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year promises to be under the sign of holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six trivial things that can annoy colleagues terribly
Emails we forget to send, voice messages we never receive, innocent lies that annoy us almost more: these are things that "embellish" the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether we get used to these troubles or take up the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble for others.
Examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you they called you from the marketing department," says a colleague.
That you missed an appointment?
At best he's sorry and tries to fix things by calling the marketing department to tell them he forgot to get the message across (this is the least common solution).
In the majority of cases, the thing is arranged with an apology.
Before having painful explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and to make efforts to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to grab a folder, an office tool or the phone and you can't find them anywhere.
Do you remember that the day before you put the stapler on the desk but it disappeared the next morning?
Do you accidentally find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's desk?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without asking otherwise they are right to be angry with you for having stolen their property.
Do not bring envelopes, post-it notes in your pocket because it can be annoying that there are no more and that you need them right away.
Do you chat about the privacy of colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop gossip that is spreading.
Who did what, with whom?
Where and why?
Don't tell everyone your information (assumptions) about your colleagues' private lives!
If a colleague shares their intimate secrets with you, don't abuse their trust!
Bury the shared information in you and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues are also aware.
Do you declare yourself sick for no reason?
When you call the office and declare yourself sick under the pretext of a heartbreaking headache because you feel bad or you feel you need rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent business, your missions must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't make trouble for your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you will not go to work or that something may happen that would force you to stay at home, do not forget to warn your boss and your colleagues so that they are not surprised by your absence the next day.
Humming, snickering, phone
You immerse yourself in your work but the sneer of your colleagues brutally tears you away?
You have unwittingly become a witness to a telephone discussion that you would have been better off not listening?
Do not disturb your colleagues with humming, humming, talking aloud (which you lead over their head), kicks, swear words or discontent expressed aloud.
They can be disturbing even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you accusing others of a foul?
If your work is not done by the deadline, you forget to send a mail or an important message, do not blame anyone for this oversight!
Don't blame it on the possible chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you made a mistake and if it presented inconvenience to others, repair the fault!
Ask how you could make amends for your mistake, fix the negligence!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Putting a jogging and slippers is comfortable at home but they are not suitable for the office!
Do not put on comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by putting on pretty and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you're no longer interesting
We move slowly in the usual morning cork.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I turn up the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the tones of any time, then a female choir comes to join it like a real jewel.
Mr2 plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
Hungarian musical life did not spoil us for a long time with good quality electronic pop.
Now, it seems that the cork becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born of the Hungarian digital underground gradually begin to change the overall image and, despite the new fashion of garage rock tearing the guitar, Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he himself played in Yonderboi's band before he embarked on his own path, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, a combination of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, began to make a name for himself when he was entrusted with the composition of filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The season of Ferenc Török).
The band initially playing in small clubs began to be known by a wider audience when wan2 magazine cited their first album of 2002 among the fifty most important records on the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, almost the only creators of the Hungarian trend who would be so competitive in the West.
Zagar and his ensemble have become unmistakably "trendy" but no one asked them if they would wear this label.
The band reacted properly, they released a new and better record.
The album entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, released recently, may open new paths for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It is that it was a line of the former group of Pécs of Balázs Zságer.
We are there with the reference to flight but next to the aerial music appears now, following the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, singer currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs at the premiere of the album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a real hit for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, recently playing popular music from morning to night, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything is fine (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer questions.
hvg.hu: This new hit pushes me to ask a question: has your music remained a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music aimed at a certain layer doesn't mean much to me.
For me there are two castes in light music; non-mainstream or underground, non-alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
So-called alternative, underground music can also be mediocre and made only to sell them and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere too.
The attitude of reception also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is either more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the West, light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only young people in their twenties but also older people.
They follow with much more attention the changes that have occurred in light music because they believe that it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or and how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I'm obviously happy to see that more and more people come to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the audience is more important at concerts where mutual influence already works but it is only perceived in the elusive changes of the moment.
However, I noticed that if you wanted to meet the expectations of the public, you will no longer be interesting.
hvg.hu: Do you intend to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and has made a career rather in the west.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow his path even if sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
We are more like team players who trust each other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, it was of course inevitable that our music would be compared to that of Yonderboi because many of us left his band and took another path.
hvg.hu: On mr2 Petõfi's charts, Wings of Love occupies the first place.
Many people first heard Zagar's name through this song.
With this more popular style you consciously opened to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't plan to make a hit to be able to sell the record.
This song means more things.
We wanted it for the finale of the album to try to soften the of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists of the Hungarian music scene.
Thus was composed the six-member choir, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, which was later named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a bit?
Zs.B.: This song already existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought that there was still something missing from this song.
The chord sequence attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the same night the melody that the girls learned later.
I got it almost right away and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me at the time but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice she would not have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert as well it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except for a brief solo by Judy Jay), they don't have a role alone, they all sing together and they don't sing louder than the music, so the music doesn't just accompany their singing.
They were behind the stage too.
Is that intentional?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is only due to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we must forget a little about our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we just have to let these wings, the wings of love, carry us away.
I wanted others to also feel that euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: To tell the truth, none of the music creation process, we had more difficult pieces during the mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything fell into place like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite about the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I have already "dropped" this record.
Right now, it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The treacherous trader risked billions because of his inferiority complex
A concealing fraudster.
So designates his former employee, the French giant Société Générale, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost nearly five billion euros because of him.
But it seems rather that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to equal his colleagues, and who, in addition, can in no way be considered incapable.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized in time the crisis of the American mortgage market.
"He is fragile," suggested his superiors who denounced him to the police.
However, if we stick to Kerviel's deposition reported by the French media, including Le Monde, the transactions of this man produced at the end of last year a profit amounting to 1.6 billion euros.
The crisis goes beyond the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the American crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he sensed the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Reports began to emerge in February that so-called "sub-prime" mortgages, granted to low-income customers or those who had experienced repayment difficulties in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis is not expected to affect the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and he bet well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
"As soon as I had earned my first half billion, I did not know how to announce it," says Kerviel and adds that he has, of course, kept nothing for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits to having falsified the reports in order not to be detected.
He managed to fool his superiors, although the Eurex exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who risks nothing has nothing
Was he afraid of being discovered?
Quite not.
"I felt that just getting $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where does his willingness to risk so big come from?
He only came to his post gradually.
He started working at Société Générale in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around 51 thousand dollars.
Two years later, he was already a trader's assistant, and in 2005 he became a freelance trader with an annual salary of 90 thousand dollars.
Yet he knew he would never earn as much as others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was much less regarded than others.
In view of my university curriculum and my professional and personal background," Kerviel told investigators.
However, shortly after taking office, he achieved his first great success.
Thanks to Allianz shares, he earned half a billion euros by betting on the decline of this stock during the London attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you in peace
"There was like a snowball effect," he told police.
But the superiors knew everything, or rather, they suspected it.
"As long as I won, they pretended to close their eyes."
However, it is then that the blow of the beginning of the year comes.
It loses a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decided to hide the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer an employee of the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how was it discovered?
He became suspicious because of his leave.
"Last year, I only took 4 days off.
A trader who does not take a vacation is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another," concludes Kerviel.
Czechia has the opportunity to get 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, provide €14 billion (about CZK 365 billion) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that Czechia can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Almost NOK 125 billion from seven operational programmes will go to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion kroner under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit from the largest share, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and accounts for up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Rep. Czech can obtain within the framework of these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, is intended to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the enterprise.
Companies should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new, more efficient management methods.
So far, the Rep. Czech Republic was among the least successful recipients of EU funds among the new members.
Court upheld 20-year prison sentence for former Nicaraguan president
Nicaragua's Court of Appeals on Thursday upheld the 20-year prison sentence for former Nicaraguan President Arnold Alemán, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for fraud of $100 million (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
However, he was later released and was living under house arrest in his hacienda near the Nicaraguan capital.
Whether or not the former head of the Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be imprisoned again is not clear for the moment, according to the AP agency.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will depend now on the prison officers, either they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or go back to prison.
4 years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alemán regularly moved government money to foreign company accounts in Panama.
These were shell companies and the accounts actually belonged to his closest family members and supporters.
Some of this money went into the funds Alemán had created to finance his election campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
That's the way it is.
The state budget has been adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget conceived by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who prepared it and ČSSD could not afford its refusal.
Unlike the heated debate preceding the vote on the declaration of no confidence in the government, this time nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies passed this law without any problems, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
This is a kind of paradox.
Like it or not, every chapter and every article is the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, although hidden behind the power competition between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that's why it is given more attention in the media.
The disputes of politicians are of much more interest to public opinion than abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three evils that the present budget is not able to solve at once:
The first is the large share given to the costs of mandates imposed by law, constituted not only by pensions, but also by social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" of the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second is a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the state budget deficit that represents the greatest hazard.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real time bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued bonds in disarray, indebting their municipalities disproportionately, in order to obtain, apart from money from taxes, tax fees and bank loans, new sources of investment.
In past years, they managed to repay these debts by the mass sale of shares in distribution systems, especially those of energy, obtained from the State as part of privatizations.
Today, they no longer have this souce.
If we confine ourselves to the official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has already been going through a phase of growth for several years, just like the rest of the world, and ČSSD is not failing to boast of it.
It was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
Instead, they were increasingly indebting the state.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that falls essentially on previous governments.
We are among the countries that are least at risk of poverty globally.
We therefore have no need for massive social programmes which, precisely in recent years, have unfortunately swelled unnecessarily.
Although some of the absurd populist spending approved last year before the elections has been eliminated, if a shift in the retirement age limit and a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then all politics will cease to exist in this country and whoever is in power, he will only administer.
Hardly exaggerating, it can be said that politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money taxed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism whereby ordinary fees are postponed by money order fees.
The $70 billion deficit projected for 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments had not dissipated all the money they could.
If we really do not want politicians in power to become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what it manages to collect in taxes and taxes, the calm necessary to prepare new reform laws.
Only the latter will make it possible to gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than one hundred billion dollars will be placed on the money markets through auctions.
It will be for the banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will auction $40 billion and, in addition, it will provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of the 11th. September that the central banks of individual states have decided on such concerted action, aimed at preventing or even reducing the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group in his report to clients.
"Concerted action by central banks has lowered the probability of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent," Baumohl said in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion to defaulted loans, mostly in the United States.
Analysts expect more losses in the billions.
"Central banks have chosen this approach because they need to really understand what may still follow," said NBA chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he adds.
Central banks fear that, if the banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession that could affect economic growth around the world.
Central banks made this choice after the London interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market, failed to be lowered.
This meant that banks were still afraid of mutual borrowing, despite the fact that the US, Canadian and British central banks had cut interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a further cut in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the Central Banks' approach will not help avert the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem, which is the fall in the US housing market.
President Klaus: the debates of the ecologists are incredible
Global climate change is expected to hurt developing countries in particular.
President Václav Klaus has once again spoken out on the issue of global warming.
This time the criticism fell on the United Nations international conference on climate change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, Not Green, he said the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, made up of a curious mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric accompanying it and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it is just a rocket of words, ersatz solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, during the presentation of his book, that his subject is very important to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book was also published in German translation, since, he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions".
From now on, interested persons can read his positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless has, in his opinion, enough disposition to write such a book.
He is indeed an academician capable of following and appreciating scientific treatises, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The major conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following theses: the climate is constantly changing, the changes of it are therefore normal, there is not a shared opinion by all researchers on global warming, the effects of the current changes are neither too great nor too serious, they therefore do not represent any danger and,  Finally, efforts to influence climate change are futile, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
Especially since, having experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against a fundamentalist environmentalism that does not take into consideration the relationship between costs and the profit they bring".
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken on this subject two months ago, at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people failed to renew their driver's license on time
Six hundred thousand drivers allowed the deadline to expire and failed to renew their old driving licences, which expire at the end of the year.
This is the last day that people can still apply for renewal, so the authorities are in a position to issue them a new licence before the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of unlicensed drivers will be on the road.
According to the authorities, those who no longer wish to drive have not renewed their driving licences.
While municipalities are reporting a drop in the number of applications for permit renewals, authorities in the capital are inundated with applications and the number of applications for permit renewals has been increasing this week.
The Town Hall satisfies about 2000 customers per day.
There is a queue of about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140,OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licences.
The issuance of a new licence takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request delivery within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who fail to complete the mandatory driver's licence renewal by the end of the year and drive without a valid licence will face a fine as early as January.
The culprit will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence by using an amicable approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to 2500 crowns.
According to old information, even a person who was not going to circulate was liable to a fine.
In doing so it could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to exercise restraint and impose fines not exceeding 1,000 crowns.
However, according to Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka, no one risks fines in the tens of thousands.
According to him, the driver's licence is a document that people can decide whether they want to have it or not.
It is not like with the identity card, which must be valid without exceptions.
Those who no longer wish to drive should surrender their driver's licence.
Just bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driver's licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Those with documents dating from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
Tribunal reduced sentences for detectives under contract with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police officers accused of colluding with David Berdych's gang, will serve thirteen and ten years in prison respectively.
The Prague High Court thus sentenced them definitively by reducing their sentences by 1 year and 2 years respectively.
Originally, detectives from the Department for the Fight against Organized Crime faced sentences of 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment pronounced today, only an appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is currently only waiting for the verdict of the first instance.
However, he has already received sentences in other trials amounting to more than 16 years in prison.
He can receive no more.
In January, the County Court convicted 19 people of participating in hold-ups, and the High Court was now dealing with appeals from 16 of them.
Most of the defendants had questioned the charge since the beginning of the investigation, claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, the police officers, after an agreement with Berdych among others, passed on information from police sources to criminals, covered up the various hold-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
In return, the gang handed over 30 percent of the theft to Opava and Koňařík.
The charge refers to the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
Mainly armed robbery, the victims of which have, in most cases, suffered serious damage to health, but also abuse of power by a public official and prohibited weaponry.
During the domestic searches, the police discovered illegally held pistols, shells with a steel core, a sight for direct laser fire or a machine gun.
According to the accusations, the gang enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from nearly two dozen men in that trial, courts have already convicted Berdych and a range of others of other robberies.
Other men from the Berdych neighborhood are still explaining themselves in court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached court.
The main hearing has avoided, for the time being, Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej who are currently living in detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of substituting children: 12 million
The lawyer for the affected families Igor Veleba wants compensation of 12 million crowns plus costs from the Třebíč hospital.
Three million for each mother, two million for fathers and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the hospital's lawyer Ondřej Dostál completely disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, this one is very, very high," Dostál said after the hearing.
"In order to form an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report that the opposing party has commissioned to be drafted.
We will check if it has any explanatory value.
But we continue to believe that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostál stressed.
The amount, according to him, should be set between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloňov's family demanded one million kroner for each month they could not raise their biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, the parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stressful situation was better endured by men, although they faced remorse for failing to prevent the substitution of newborns.
Women, on the other hand, remain less serene in the face of the experience of trauma in the news and in front of what is happening precisely at this moment, summarized the content of the Veleva report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the hospital in Třebíč on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermák family in Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the governor of the region Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil handed over to each of the families 100,000 crowns to reimburse expenses caused by the error of the hospital in Třebíč run by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are obliged by law to take on liability insurance.
In case of non-compliance, they must draw on the reserve fund, exceptionally, they can ask the manager for help.
Until now, the courts have recognized relatively small compensation, the sums calculated from the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Valašské Království (Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute concerning the trade mark Valašské království (Kingdom of Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, it was indeed he who had used the title King of Valašsko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, a former collaborator of the actor.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitizing on Bolek Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Valašsko evoke to everyone precisely this actor and comic.
Harabiš agrees.
"There is almost ten years of work behind us.
Searching for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, it is money that is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project is successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to interfere with our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who first used the title valašský král (King of Valašsko) in his TV show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him king in 1993.
However, at the time, this had nothing to do with the plan to set up a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing passports from Valašské Království.
From a humorous action at the beginning it resulted in a lucrative business and commercial activity, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka agreed to have his name and signature mentioned in the passport and he even offered the holders sales on the price of visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the naked idea, published by Polívka in the program manéž, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Valašské království project," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team who were intensely dedicated to the project.
Collaboration between today's enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka a Harabiš, which culminated in the deposition of "King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under Harabiš's inspiration, assumed by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, a request that the court has now rejected.
What could clarify the matter is the tournament envisaged for the throne and half of the princess.
A new king should come out of it.
He didn't want to betray the details and date yet.
"We don't want to go fast.
it would be something like the parade of kings in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a time.
Even Mr. Polívka can of course register," Harabiš added.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: diparition of prejudices
To tell the truth, I've never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its ride qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of gear shifting, driving and also that of manufacture could, in many ways, be described as below average.
However, currently there is on the market its successor the Peugeot 207 which is much better.
Especially since the combi named SW goes a step further, I just have to think better.
When I was testing the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207 I complained for example about the headroom on the back seats.
While there are no more complaints because the combi bodywork means that even the big devils will be, in this regard, comfortable.
Let's see quickly
I will mention the interior very quickly so as not to repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty successful design, my only remark being about the central tunel which seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, given that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the days of complaining about seats or backrests that are too short are over.
The side guidance has also improved significantly compared to the 206 model.
As for space, the increase in body dimensions is noticeable here too.
The combi also sees the lack of space above the head already mentioned.
A chest in the trunk
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage rack.
I have to evaluate this one as very well accessible (also thanks to the rear swivel glass) and a rather easy lashing.
Blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics that are an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold heavy objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
This is, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is compared to the competition a rather average figure.
Apart from the Škoda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in this category in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mlada Boleslav product, we see that the Peugeot remains very significantly behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to going on holiday abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to highlight the advantages, I would mention the underbody remaining after the backrests of the rear seats are overturned perfectly straight, or a very low step.
120 horsepower spread over four cylinders
The automobile we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And truth be told, that's what a 1.6 that makes a family hatchback work should look like.
It is quiet, consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Škoda which often gives the impression of having an exhaust pipe clogged by a mop, then I can only be enthusiastic.
Let's browse the rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a fairly well-equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The base price of a vehicle with a 1.4-liter Otto engine of 329,900 Kč is still fair.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410,900 Kč, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 Kč.
However, we also had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wipers, automatic control of the rear windows ...
In reality, the vehicle ultimately costs 531,900 Kč.
That's a lot, but try to add the extra equipment to the price of the Fabia and you'll get a very similar figure.
All that remains is to choose the brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is in poor shape
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, causing concern about the development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a series of obstacles.
British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the original inhabitants turn into violence.
The case of North Kent, where conflicts between remaining and immigrants of Slovak origin are beginning to escalate, illustrate the problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe.
Arguments, bickering and fights between students have been transposed into relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who was hitting a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The culprit defends herself by claiming that the boy had insulted her with rasist remarks.
Police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant by two teenage girls.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks and threw stones at the man.
"When we were coming home, a young man climbed onto the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he responded with apples and pears and then he uncovered his buttocks," described another unpleasant affair a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One has gone so far as to describe conflicts with immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show that the atmosphere in British schools between the original inhabitants and the immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70,000 Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your holidays can be achieved if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Fins and all inclusive with waiters offering you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and that is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the stronghold of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the repository and transshipment of the treasures that the Spanish had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 20's.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who had it built, since everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients, there were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall buildings grew and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 50's of the last century, circulated on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
Stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
So what about today?
You can leave your own autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita de la Havana.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still circulate in Havana, since the jigoulis and fiats once imported have already for a long time, in a climate so salty and humid, rotten.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is noticeably decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity are there as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings the money so needed, its development has the green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have sprung up not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holguín province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and that will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane had returned from the plantations spread out in the sugar factories on a narrow gauge by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how we can see in operation small locomotives whose contemporaries are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to direct his steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the most famous places.
There is therefore no need to write a lot about Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise remember that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that whoever loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Viňales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
Exuberant vegetation grows on calcareous soil.
Mogotes, limestone balloons and rocks rise in candlelight from the bottom of the valley, and, fertile earth having caught in their bowels, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense vegetal carpet.
The valley is where probably the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
Perhaps someone will also find it interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was filmed.
Trinidad
Ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It was the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought him fame and wealth.
The richness was embodied in the beauty and showcase city character of this small city.
Koloniální španělská architektura,výrazně ovlivněná pozdějšími francouzskými osadníky, se za čtyři staletí téměř nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is a place so remote that even in the 50's of the last century, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay on the sidelines.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything either, everyone was content to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more time in Trinidad than an afternoon, then it is also worth visiting interesting places in the surrounding area, such as Playa Ancón beach or the Sugar Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música which comes alive after sunset and where the music is muted only in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this town located in the extreme east of Cuba as the most beautiful on the island.
This opinion is certainly influenced already by the path that leads to it.
The two roads that lead to it from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and pass through a landscape almost without marks of human activity.
UNESCO has inscribed the eastern reef of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is made there, in the church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in fact, it was born about a hundred years after the journey of Columbus) and from the hill where the old castle and the current hotel El Castillo stand, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain range, the Bay of Sows and Isla de Pinos Island, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of former slaves, about all this we could fill a lot of pages.
Only, as they say, it is better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, say Americans
The lack of soldiers and necessary equipment influences, according to the United States, the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as it should, agreed in Edinburgh in Scotland representatives of countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
In addition to growing opposition from the Taliban movement, the eight states involved are now also discussing future plans and allied coordination.
While the United States this week called on NATO troops through Defence Secretary Robert Gates for greater activity, Britain sees strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and stepping up development aid as a priority.
"The evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military might can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow residents to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
Afghan insurgent activity is, according to U.S. military data, the most intense in the past five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to last year, up to 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, almost a quarter of them in the southern part.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit both in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they are asking for other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop made similar remarks today.
"I'm not happy with what we have on land and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and equipment we need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that lasted three days.
Who is passive
The last few months have also reigned conflicts between the countries involved over whether all allies are actually doing everything possible in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat requirements they are subject to are not as stringent as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan slackers discovered: Germans play, while ours fight," Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table-stand.
The German newspaper Bild went on the counter-attack by publishing a photo of a British troop during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt to rise to one trillion in 2009
The burden of a state debt exceeding 84,000 crowns falls on each Czech.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
Thanks to a better-than-expected development of state budget savings, the ministry has reduced the planned amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The Czech Republic's state debt rose towards the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
During the nine months of this year it has therefore increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, from June onwards, it decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on the State's debt dating from the beginning of October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns falls on each Czech.
During the whole of last year, the state was indebted by more than 111 billion crowns.
"At the moment, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit forecast for next year, we could cross the trillion crown border only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikor's forecast is similar: "We could exceed one trillion in 2009.
The precise date will depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it appeared that the situation on the political scene changed, that politicians were ready to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
Debts are growing
The State's debt is constituted by the debts of the central government and it is generated essentially by the accumulation of deficits in the State budget.
The State's debt is financed by treasury bills, annuity securities, direct loans or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The State's internal debt has increased this year so far from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state's external debt has increased this year so far from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called tradable state debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average liability of the State's debt was 6.5 years.
"Total debt has increased inter-annually from the first to the third quarters by 13 percent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, far too high.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by annuity securities where it reaches 20 per cent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be something to negotiate when the pension reform comes," Pikora data commented.
Better than expected
As a result of the strategy for financing and managing the State's debt for 2007, the government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to a better-than-expected evolution of the state budget savings, the ministry reduced the planned amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The sum is mainly made up of the deficit of the state budget which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the 91.3 billion crowns initially planned.
Secondly, there are the maximum sources provided for the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely 13.3 billion crowns, the reserve of 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of state annuity securities for 43 billion crowns and the repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to 1.8 billion crowns.
She was appearing in court in Khartoum today for naming a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday night by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and deportation, her lawyer said.
The Briton was accused of letting students aged 6 to 7 give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear when any depiction of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was liable to lash.
The 54-year-old British teacher at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested Sunday at her home and charged with insulting Islam and sedition under Article 125 of Sudan's penal code, following several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asks her students, aged 6/7, to choose a name for the teddy bear in the class.
"Eight names come out of the mouths of the children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says the school's principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the photo of the bear followed by the caption "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself had no label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the depiction of the prophet as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that she would never have done anything insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name", which he said was only an "innocent mistake".
This opinion is shared by many of the teacher's students who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never talks about religion in class".
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second name most given in Great Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
For example, can it be given to a toy?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
They failed to reach an agreement on the province's future status on Wednesday at the latest negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians concluded a sixth and final session of talks Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without having been able to overcome their differences over the future status of the breakaway province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were not able to reach an agreement on the status," European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger told a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was "at stake", his US counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
"Violence is not expected in the immediate future but we are entering a very difficult period," he added, noting that "obvious tensions exist".
End of mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the 90 percent Albanian-speaking province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by Dec. 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final round of negotiations since the troika was tasked with a new UN mediation last August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, the West believes that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina says it is ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," announced the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel of Baden where were taking place since Monday these "negotiations of the last chance".
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovar rebellion and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that led to murders and deportations."
'Domino effect'
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was still possible, warning Kosovo's Albanian majority of the consequences of unilaterally declaring the province's independence.
Belgrade says it fears a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
"For Serbia," he said, "this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be taken exclusively by the Security Council, where its Russian ally has veto power.
'Kosovo's Parliament will have the last word'
"Only a solution in the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu replied that "the Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian speakers would be done "in consultation" with the West.
Bush snatches agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference convened by him on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately begin negotiations to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end its settlement activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations under the "road map" for peace they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would be aimed at "concluding a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including core issues."
This name covers the three thorny issues at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be "comprehensive and thorough" and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others."
Olmert pledged that the upcoming talks would be "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to complete them in the course of 2008".
Bush has set the end of 2008 as the deadline for implementing his "vision of two states" of Palestine and Israel that coexist.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment to this effect from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis was a success for Washington, was behind a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that offered Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it addresses the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud said in his interview with the Saudi-owned Arabic-language daily.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always in this type of news item, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What were the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the National Police (IGPN), a police car was circulating Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"She was not in intervention but on patrol, and was traveling at 40-50 km / h, without flashing lights," says a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, "not homologated, therefore not allowed to circulate on public roads" (read below) and ridden by two young people without helmets, was circulating "at very high speed".
"She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority on the right," says a police officer.
The alcohol level test performed on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (front broken, starry windshield, bumper torn off) testifies to the violence of the impact.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced to have entrusted an investigation for "facts of involuntary homicide and non-assistance to person in danger" to the IGPN, co-seized with the departmental direction of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor specifies that the investigation of the IGPN, at this stage, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard Sunday night, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this mini-motorcycle arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a kind of groove, probably caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained entangled until the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be the subject of a technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have very quickly left the scene, thus not helping the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out "any serious fault" on this point.
"This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, on which we must be very careful," said a police source.
Libération met an eyewitness of those moments after the accident.
One of its windows precisely overlooking the stage.
"We immediately went downstairs, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to revive them, says this witness.
There was nothing to do."
He then saw "a completely haggard policeman, limping.
Two others were trying to resuscitate one of the youths, the fourth was talking on the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, the certainty that those present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the police were taken away by car by colleagues who arrived on the scene.
Still according to this witness, the help arrived "about twenty minutes after the departure of the police".
They also performed heart massages, to no avail.
"I will not let it be said that the police did not assist young people.
These young people were rescued.
Firefighters arrived right away.
Everything was done to try to save them, "said the prosecutor.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday cracked down on the first protests since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against measures taken under the state of emergency were injured by tear gas canisters used by security forces, witnesses said.
The latter responded with stones, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and injured lawyers.
Several were reportedly arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers from the Supreme Court Bar Association called for a general strike and announced protests, following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other demonstrations reportedly took place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement on Monday garnered the support of religious parties grouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president "urged the population to send flowers to the judges who ruled against the state of emergency and rubbish to those who took the oath before Musharraf".
'Musharraf's promise no longer holds'
Pakistan's Supreme Court is directly targeted by the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday night.
It was due to decide in the coming days on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election to the presidential election on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was ousted and replaced.
"Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to Supreme Court rulings," the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to step down as head of the army and become a civilian president "no longer holds" after the state of emergency is declared, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
Meanwhile, the Pakistani government has denied persistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf has been placed under house arrest by his deputy army chief.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unplanned births.
Even today, more than one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (INED), forty years after the passage of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unplanned births.
The various methods of contraception such as the pill or the IUD still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates INED.
The liberalization of contraception has nevertheless allowed a better "control of fertility", according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Or even calculated to the nearest month for one couple in five and if possible in spring, season considered the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It took astronaut Scott Parazynski and his International Space Station (ISS) crew more than seven hours of work in space to make the dramatic repair of a torn solar panel, essential to the station's continued scientific activities.
A risky exit that has accumulated records because of its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, the tools "cobbled together" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem emerged on Tuesday when astronauts unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical piece that would soon house the European and Japanese science laboratories, from the Discovery shuttle (see box).
This module is a kind of landing dock for laboratory modules.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a module of electricity production by solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to put it in position on its final position.
After moving it, the crew began redeploying the module's solar panels, which have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, was damaged for nearly a meter by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment was stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally supposed to perform a control sortie of the shuttle Discovery, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to caracolate at the end of the 30 meters of length of the remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Tall, resistant, very dexterous, he has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this doctor by training was therefore tasked with "operating" the "injured" solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he severed the offending cable and installed some sort of "splints" on the damaged area.
He was helped by a second "spacewalker" who remained near the airlock and, from the inside, by the other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey cane wrapped in insulation to prevent electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "tinkered" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was complete, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was fully deployed before taking inventory of his tools and returning to the interior of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts returned to the shuttle Discovery for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
EADS shares sanctioned on the stock exchange
EADS shares are currently down sharply on the Paris stock exchange, after the aerospace and defense group announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS lost 4% to 21.96 euros currently on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to revise its operating profit forecast for 2007 following delays caused by the slow progress of the development of the A400M engine, which determines the maiden flight of the aircraft.
The cost to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, including more than 1 billion for Airbus", announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
As a result of these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating profit (EBIT) targets for 2007 when it presents its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds, without elaborating.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS' operating income fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to charges related to delays in another program, that of the very large A380 aircraft.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspense on Sunday, at the exit polls: the Russians will overwhelmingly opt for President Putin's party, United Russia.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days before the general elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is today sending voters a televised message on public channels, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the head of the list of United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory promises to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not let this show when he received foreign ambassadors, content himself with delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and want honest, the most transparent and open elections, smooth elections," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from the target.
She denounces a campaign tainted by pressure.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says there have "never been such dirty elections, even in Yeltsin's time."
After the repression of demonstrations last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, remains banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of homo sovieticus"
Behind these legislative elections without suspense are two much more open questions:
- Who will succeed Putin as president?
The Official Gazette published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; Candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
But no successor emerges.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and of the all-powerful United Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, in the legislative as in the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It is a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of homo sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their destiny," said sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada Center.
Historian Nikolai Koposov of St. Petersburg State University goes back further: civil society has fallen behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; The famous community spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 90s, "Putin returned to the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic affluence," said Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "voluntarily renounce the personal responsibility" they briefly showed after the break-up of the USSR.
"What's the point of thinking?"
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) lead the local lists of United Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 90s.
Public opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which Russians will not vote for extremists either.
Tamara Cherednichenko, a 54-year-old teacher, concludes: "What's the point of thinking?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them? »
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives in Bad Arolsen, which trace the fates of 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, are freely accessible.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were until now only available for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or his beneficiaries.
The eleven states in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all States having been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Historians' access to Bad Arolsen will allow research "including on the movements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of forced labourers," said Reto Meistern, director of the archives, which are run by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, opposed the opening to the public of these nominative documents, because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the supposed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
Concentration camp registers or arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subjected to compulsory labour and, possibly, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents," Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Antisemitism at the Technische Universität Berlin, said in 2006.
EU and India aim to reach free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches nearly €60 billion per year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission the green light last April to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches nearly €60 billion per year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its largest foreign investor, but India is only the EU's 9th largest trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact will greatly boost both economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Mandelson said.
Europe is the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, the EU commissioner said. The Asian and European giants trade annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "ten billion euros of services", said this week Danièle Smadja, head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has "not yet reached its potential". The EU and India are meeting on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England acknowledges concerns by offering £10 billion over five weeks
The Bank of England said Thursday it was anxious to ease the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
"To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation,"  it said in a statement.
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
This is the first time the BoE has put five-week liquidity on the market in an open market operation.
These are normally done within a week.
The BoE added in its statement that it "stands ready to take further steps to maintain rates" of overnight interbank lending in line with its base rate.
The overnight interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate stood at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England were accompanied by a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from using them.
According to some rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the pound's exchange rate against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums put on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused on Thursday to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Registered in a socialist "niche" (session at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted Tuesday by the national office of the PS including the increase of 50% of the premium for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a transport check or the control of rents.
UMP and NC having voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was adjourned at the end of the general discussion which gave rise to exchanges, sometimes lively, between majority and opposition a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS deputies Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent all of its proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors about C3 Presents' creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announced the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with British producer Melvin Benn's Festival Republic.
"For our company, it's an honor to work with someone who has inspired the current festival movement in America," C3's Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces Chicago's Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey is a summer camping destination.
The festival is scheduled to be held Aug. 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Once known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the world's most respected festival producers.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and in 2006, Festival Republic established the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which now seats up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury "the most inspiring event" he's ever attended, C3's Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn's are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We chose Philadelphia as our market and were working diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," Jones said.
"We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
Unfortunately, we have become bogged down in politics because of the current administration," Jones said.
"Fortunately, we were able to speak with Melvin Benn and we are about to create a great festival at an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Chicago's Grant Park, after making a name for itself in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
"Melvin Benn's European model is a country festival, while ours are more in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both a European and an American-style urban festival feel."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says "they are interesting enough to invest in such an event and host a festival that will hopefully have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very large," as is that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said invitations had been extended to the groups, but nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going to press.
"Vineland will be rock-flavored, but the music will be varied, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partners at C3, which received the Top Independent Promoter award at the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal takes on the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood movie sets to Montreal when none other than Terminator opposes it...
This mission of seduction is part of the functions of a delegate.
One term - "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the paws of the "Governator"?
"You have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge the best," he says.
The race for festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is to promote local cinema.
The Oscar race has begun.
He will be at all the festivals on the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, to present Quebec films, highlight them and ensure that directors do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a great showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil opens in Santa Monica and premieres at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-of-year rally on the stock market? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
With less than five weeks to go until the end of the fiscal year, investors are already rubbing their hands hoping for the arrival of the traditional end-of-year rally.
However, this year experts are not as sure that will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock market generally has a positive behavior.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts based exclusively on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainties lie in wait in the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of the stock market gaining momentum in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market feeds on the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the leakage effect towards quality stocks both in long and short periods".
For this, they believe that the stock market will have a rather lateral behavior, not free of volatility "especially because we do not know the impact of the probable rate cut of the Fed, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary pressures"
Javier Barrio, BPI's sales manager in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say there will be a rally.
"It's not the best thing," says the expert.
The Ibex, the Spanish stock index, has lost nearly 4% since November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension schemes that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be a little different this year since he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution Day (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, believes that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound in the index that could be caused depending on the information that arrives from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree on the stocks that will be responsible for leading Ibex to new maximum targets.
Intermoney's Solana says that "this year the big values are back for him".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two big banks and some manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco assures that the increases will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
Manufacturers will also be able to benefit from this rally, if they get started.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other manufacturers such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," said the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will also do it very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
In the last seven years, only on two occasions has December been a bearish month.
The real year-end rally took place in 2003, when stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the bursting of the tech bubble.
This year, during which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, the month of December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
We will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the moment the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it succeeds in computer on its end-of-year rally.
La Banque Populaire will open 200 offices open 12 noon from Monday to Saturday
Banque Populaire has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Populaire Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its branches until 20:30, and to open on Saturdays from 10:00 to 20:30.
Another group that has also reiterated several times that it would like to expand the hours of its branches, BBVA, even if it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is close to reaching an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its branches on Saturdays instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the Banque Populaire's experiment will be decisive for whether or not other organizations adhere to this initiative, which coincides with business hours.
It is precisely this objective that Banque Populaire seeks.
Attract autonomous customers who circulate in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and businesses on the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 branches throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not a question of opening new branches but of renovating existing ones.
To do this, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers on different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the interior of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The bank's commercial manager, Ángel Rivera, assures that this renovation does not involve large investments, but the hiring of staff, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per branch.
The branches, which will also have space for SMEs to gather there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Banque Populaire has already tested its initiative in three branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as Ángel Rivero explains.
The branches of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets in Madrid are the streets to have been chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
Banque Populaire currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others that operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very wide hours, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax branches they will not copy the model of BBVA, where several of its branches have a wide range of non-financial products for its sale.
"We don't want to compete with our customers," Rivero notes.
For now, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles the stock market value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
We got there.
With this sentence Paolo Vasile, a telecinco delegate, expressed his satisfaction yesterday, at the close of the stock market, when he saw that the channel he heads doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect tarnished his joy: "what hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more but that we have decreased less," he said.
However, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain stabilizes its loss at 15.66% for a year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which fell yesterday 1.52% and which accumulates a decline of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of other listed communication companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million in Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is due to the fact that "we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience."
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first TV channel this year to surpass 1,000 million in gross advertising revenue, said Giuseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
For this announced figure to be real, the television channel would have to record an increase of 3.6% in its billing for advertising for the current financial year compared to 965.4 million in the 2006 financial year.
Net billing for Antenne 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to $734.4 million), while net television revenues increased by 0.7% ($630.4 million).
One of the factors that the annalists point to for the best relative evolution of Telecinco on the stock market is the large pay-out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that while it's early to make a decision, that ratio could vary after Endemol's 33% buyout and in association with Mediaset.
"We have the official compromise to give for minimal 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given shares with the 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently cut its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decline in projected revenue growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company lowered Antenne 3's earnings forecast to 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities recommends buying both stocks based primarily on its high dividend return and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
La Caja Madrid sees Telecinco better (accumulating) than Antenne 3 (maintaining) for the 'multiple attractions' and the rise in business.
3.
JPMorgan: it recommends looking into both cases since it has had 'similar threats' (a saturated market and a bad economic climate).
Congress approves transposition of Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of Congress of the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the year ends.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the effort made by MPs and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations to guarantee investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of the bodies so that markets function effectively.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Law, involves the modernization of financial markets, at a time when it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will make it possible to provide financial advisory services to specialist company names as well as to natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting firms (AFIs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions in financial instruments, so that it is possible to add to the regulated secondary markets multilateral trading facilities and order internationalization systems, which compete with the current stock exchange managers.
The Law also obliges investment services firms to disclose on the market information on key aspects of its business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and requires them to keep a register of all transactions they carry out, to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
Going through the Congressional Economic Committee, several changes have been added, including one that highlights that tenured debts will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk for the investor, which has been demonstrated by what happened with US subprime mortgage debt.
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of the management took advantage to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics can have 30 years after that in 1977, was approved, the royal decree that delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the ombudsman, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to lend his services of marketing products and attracting new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised index of consumer prices rises by five-tenths in November, to 4.1%
This indicator, which Eurostat then uses to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an overview of price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by offering data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The leading indicator is calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information on which is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the leading indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data that will be revealed on December 14.
"CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
Second Vice-President and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November is a "time figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes clarified in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential over the monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
"We were hoping for a figure around 4%," acknowledged the Minister of Economy in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros over three years
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen by more than 50% to 12,000 million pounds (16,800 million euros) since it entered the crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergence credit from the Bank of England.
At that time he was amassing some record deposits above 25,000 million pounds, a figure that gradually fell in two and a half months because of the mistrust of his customers and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the Government has offered and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the body with its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to seize around a quarter of the revenues of British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to obtain these remaining 18,000 million pounds until reaching the target of 30,000 million.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for its garish advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the offer of the Virgin association, in which three other companies participate, including its favorite to save it from bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested today early morning the current mayor of the Murcian commune of Totana (of the Popular Party) because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption web discovered this week.
In addition, one of the clerks of the municipal council and the chief of police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May's Juan Morales, current right-wing deputy and until then city councillor of the City Council, and who according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Channel, could be the "leader" of this frame.
The agents continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Planning Council and the possibility of new stops in the coming hours is not ruled out.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot, discovered at the beginning of this semine, was charged.
As SER reported yesterday to the lawyer of the deputy 'of the popular party' Juan Morales, he was arrested leaving Morales' home with important documentation in his possession relating to the frame.
In addition, according to sources of the investigation, the object of the investigation is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a construction company in Galicia to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people detained.
Bono agrees to lead the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win the elections.
Former Defence Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of the Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
Thus the organizing secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this noon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
Moreover he stressed that "yes it seems" that the politician from La Manche will be the candidate of the socialist group that will preside over the Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of the Congress, which on November 15 made public its decision not to run in the next general elections and to abandon his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change in academia.
The former minister acknowledged that the Prime Minister has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned it two years ago.
In addition, he pointed out that, even if citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not insult or shouting" and make "it look more and more like citizens."
"Sometimes it seems miserably that the only place in Madrid where you cannot speak quietly and calmly is Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on certain occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his know-how" and he did not want to act as if he was already in office so as not to fall, as he pointed out, into what his opponents might consider "domination".
Climate propaganda
Given that the climate change movement subjects both skeptics of its predictions and those prioritizing other political and social battles to merciless persecution, it must demonstrate iron consistency.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement who is president of the government like Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government has contributed decisively to Spain being at the head of the European Union in the non-execution of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who is responsible for the non-execution, in what sectors did it occur and why his Government, that of the contract with the planet, did not avoid it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures it will take to curb climate change.
Which businesses will be affected, what citizens' habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will we be forced to make, what economic consequences will this cause.
That is, who will sacrifice themselves and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has been and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Up to the hundredth of the gasoline suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to him electorally so dangerous to Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
That is to say, it is a question of saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with slogans devoid of any real consequence.
With impactful phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for electoral campaigns who does not speak, who does not denounce and who does not demand, embellishes meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that it is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not claim that we travel by bicycle or refresh ourselves with the fan.
Mayor and Chief of Totana Local Police Arrested for Alleged Urban Corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the chief of the local police, the secretary of the City Council and a hotel contractor suspected of possible urban crimes, informed today sources of the investigation.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and taken to the Town Hall, where at the moment many agents have gathered, who have also presented themselves to the function of municipal councillor of Urban Planning and the municipal company of management of Industrial Land and Housing.
These three judgments are in addition to the six judgments made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people have not been arrested but they are accused of the judicial investigation, which the Court No. 1 of Totana is investigating.
The first six detainees have now been disposed of in court.
According to the sources, the previous municipal councillor of Totana and currently an autonomous parliamentarian of the PP party, Juan Morales, is under investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancée of the former city councilor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A., lawyer and entrepreneur from Vigo (Galicia), were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, an agency of the Nuaria Group, through which the bribes were allegedly made.
The investigation is the responsibility of the Urban Crimes Unit of the Central Operative Unit (UCO) of the Gendarmerie, whose officers, in addition to arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies linked to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a poultry products company very well known in the region, who may have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that have been requalified and its project would involve doubling the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is made up of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with real estate development; Conycase, which manages Vigo's car parks on Coruña Street, Venezuela Street and Fernando el Católico Square; Hogartel, which handles direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with yesterday's commentary in Finland's most important newspaper (admittedly at the top of PISA information above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that it appeared there, curiously, the review of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the Philosophy course has challenged public opinion as a consequence of the tragedy of the school of Jokela.
The culprit of the dead, a baccalaureate student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Advisor in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and he affirmed that studying Nietzsche is not indisputable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools.

A colleague passes the information on the introduction into the Penal Code of offences on Internet downloads:
Has. Downloading a song would be an offence punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft from a cds shop with a value of less than 400 euros is considered only as a fault (Article 623.1).
B. Theft from a shop worth up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than the penalty for downloading (a section 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in compact disc trafficking.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and trafficking in CDS would involve a sentence of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without authors' permission is punishable more than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Finally, if my colleague is right, then someone is exaggerating.

My GP told me about one of his articles on strange research entitled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
That is, the feelings generated by workers' monthly pay depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was carried out using tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the neurocognition images group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed."
The researchers observed that when both people guessed they were receiving the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one of them received double, activation was greater.
I don't know if that conclusion required that much science.
The Balkan Prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been ruthlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years from the prosecution of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague.
Her term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died - ex-general Ratko Mladic and former Serbobosnio leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are in this list from which the documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, ' Carla's list ' (2006, not screened exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a crime thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York who pursues fugitive criminals and pressures the governments involved to narrow the circle.
Which insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the event of possible losses, involves a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, gender, age of the driver's license, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or the use made of it, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
Y es que, escoger el seguro de automóvil adecuado es incluso más difícil que elegir el modelo de vehículo.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance, is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise takes the form of an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in exchange becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of the driver's license, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the rating to be paid.
It is for this reason that people over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these people have a lower claims rate due to their caution.
Similarly, using censuses, companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and therefore the probability of having an accident.
By increasing the frequency the probabilities increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
This is why the driver must study the situation carefully to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
Here we will set out the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers him a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face various disadvantages when contracting with insurance at an affordable price, such as the lack of driving experience and the age of the driver's license.
Although the ideal way to be well insured is an all-risk insurance, other more economical options exist.
The most far-sighted drivers can opt for all-risk insurance with a deductible, so that they get the coverage of an all-risk insurance but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the claim that the customer pays will be established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," says Luis Noguera, the head of First Europa, an online insurance mediator in Spain.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A word of advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid losses as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, which may reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the base rate owned by the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
"Bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it can afford to increase the bonuses, "clarifies Noguera.
Beyond the age of 25 it becomes easier for drivers when signing a contract with insurance, since the claims rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
It is for this reason that it is preferable to choose an all-risk insurance with deductible.
"Normally young people cannot benefit from the experience gained beforehand after an accident," says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once past the "fear of the novice".
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is preferable for him to negotiate insurance at all risks, as long as his economic situation allows it.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be the people with the lowest claims ratio, because the mark-ups will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be an all-risk insurance with deductible (which can be 300 euros), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
"They have a more relaxed driving style and they have more purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchises," Noguera said.
For retirees an all-risk insurance with deductible is preferable (being this one of 150 euros), or an extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the event of possible losses, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is why it is fundamental to properly study the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
Celtic will be looking to win a point in Milan to reach the knockout stages
AC Milan and Celtic Glasgow face off next Tuesday at San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closure of the Champions League, since it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to qualify.
The Italians have ten points and they have already qualified in the fifth round thanks to a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow have nine points, but they still need another point to ensure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who have six, and who host Benfica who have four,  does not pass in front of him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as AC Milan are scheduled to play the Club World Cup semi-finals in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place for the final on 16th December.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the draw at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most expected result, although both teams will try to emerge victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow know that by winning they would remain first and ensure a better cross in the knockout stages.
A defeat for Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to qualify if Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but it will not be able to computer only on that since with nine points the game goes to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scots, who are hopeful of reaching the knockout stages for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten in the last edition by a goal from Kaka during extra time (1-0).
Pending the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only go to Shakhtar, in case Celtic lose, to qualify for the knockout stages to be able to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that Benfica, although they are last and without the possibility of continuing the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls kicked off in Vancouver (Canada), in front of about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group disbanded in 2000.
Posh Spice (Victoria Beckham), Scary Spice (Melanie Brown), Baby Spice (Emma Bunton), Sporty Spice (Melanie Chisholm) and Ginger Spice (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their show at Vancouver's GM Place Stadium that the band's reunion was "brilliant".
Around 20,000 people sold out tickets to attend the concert, which was the subject of a video in which is told the story of the band that was all the rage in the late 1990s.
The meeting and the world tour coincided with the release of a new album that covered their main hits as well as two new songs, ' Headlines ' and ' Voodoo ', which EMI released in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls took to the stage showing the bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice' had given them, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the audience that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had forbidden him a few days before.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham remarked that the British footballer "hasn't seen our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show".
"Sporty Spice", who left the band in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and who caused the dissolution of the group two years later, also expressed his nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that people's feeling changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said of the meeting of the group she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have gotten better and we like each other a lot."
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last showed off in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of baby sitters was waiting for them.
They had five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid they will be exhibited on December 23.
The new gas deal between Russia and Ukraine is sounding the alarm.
A dispute over the price of gas is brewing between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk of repercussions on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are conveyed by pipelines, and every pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev has announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two caused a decrease in supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia's monopoly company supplying the gas, tried in vain to reach an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom said it would raise its prices to Ukraine as planned as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50 percent more for the supply of gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said this would mean a 40 percent increase in the costs of imports from Gazprom for Ukraine.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas passes," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters news agency.
"Fluctuations in gas costs would probably be related to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine"
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused in January 2006 the interruption of Gazprom's supplies to Ukraine.
This led to a drop in exports to Western Europe, thereby increasing prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Department of Health needs to improve checks on its non-EU employees to check whether they have criminal precedents, the monitoring committee said.
The warning from the Reviewer-General, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the June attack at Glasgow airport.
Mr Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Department of Health has no precise data on the number of overseas people it employs.
Still, his report highlighted other decisive checks, properly performed on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The Auditor General carried out checks on non-Community staff following the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28, an Iraqi-born doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after driving his jeep into the gates of the main terminal.
He was one of three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October on suspicion of involvement in various car explosion attempts across the UK.
The Department of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff to ensure the validity of their qualifications, experience and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Department of Health uses Scottish Disclosure to carry out criminal precedent checks, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside of Great Britain.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor General's report now states that committees are required to confront criminal precedents with the Control Office, thus allowing employers to undertake checks on various countries.
"Although we discovered that some personnel information was verified, this is not done every time," the report said.
Mr Black said the Scottish Department of Health carries out most of the pre-employment checks it would do itself, but he also added: "Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on certain overseas staff is available to the health service.
Mr Peter Terry, chairman of BMA Scotland, said it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify employees who might commit future terrorist acts.
He said: "The report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently being carried out are working well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can add any added value."
The Scottish health authorities reported employing 1161 people from overseas, most of whom were doctors and nurses.
But the Reviewer General stressed that these figures certainly need to be revised upwards, partly because of problems in identifying staff members with permanent contracts, who may or may not choose to remain in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current control procedures of the health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are fully adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and system of pre-employment checks for overseas health service staff.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to do this work in the wake of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.
She added that the Scottish Government, allied with the health committees, would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report due to be published next month, and would commit to ensuring better enforcement of the recently updated pre-employment checks valid for all employees, including those from overseas.

Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named in honor of star Harris, protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have given people like me access to cinema," he said.
"I've been pretty lucky to meet Richard Harris twice."

Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it had arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells plotting an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on clerics and armed forces.
State television of the world's largest oil exporter, said one of the missile smugglers' cells.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have staged a campaign against the US-allied monarchy since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in Orientale Province, the TV news said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 troops to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006 on the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper, citing a statement by the interior minister, said 18 of those arrested belong to a cell headed by a "missile launch expert" who has infiltrated the country.
The militants are said to have planned to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
22 of the detainees appear to have plotted the murder of clerics and armed forces.
The government has urged clerics to do more against the Saudis in Iraq, to join al-Qaeda militants fighting against Allied Forces and the US-allied Shiite Muslim government, considered heretical according to the Saudi Sunny's hard line.
Al Qaeda militants believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clerics have collaborated with the authorities to support the policies of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militants, encouraged by calls against the pro-Western Saudi government by Osama Bin Laden, a Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader, have targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Significant efforts have been made by the armed forces during these five years. last months," the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
Among the detainees are 16 members of Medina organized into a "media cell" aimed at promoting "takfiri thought," the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports the use of violence against infidel and apostate Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 people are accused of subsidizing the activists.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of Earth.
Scientists yesterday said that Venus has certainly been a pleasant planet to live in.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are virtually the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus may have had Earth-like conditions, and may even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with a slower rotation led Venus to a whole different kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a temperature surface warm enough to melt lead.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the probe of the European Space Agency, which studied the planet for a year, offers a sad vision of the potential future of the Earth due to catastrophic changes in the climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, Professor Fred Taylor, a professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, said: "We are beginning to understand why Venus' climate is so different from Earth's, although the planets themselves are virtually similar.
"Our new data allow us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, perhaps even with a habitable surface."
Enriched uranium sequestered by police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was kidnapped by Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer said three people have been arrested and the material is currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the merchandise would be worth $1 million (£480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he was not up to the task as a presidential candidate, to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates have finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who have recorded their questions, submit them to the candidates.
On Wednesday night, November 28, none of the questions asked were as ridiculous as the one from another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked Democrats for their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers largely reflected the conditions of the Republican Party, candidate in the next election.
We do not know on what criteria, the producers of CNN, which sponsored the debate, chose the clips of You Tube to show to the aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest dealing with a single theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strongest topics for Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to phone when they heard pleasant things: The board noted increases in approval when candidates spoke rudely.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between National Front leader Rudy Giuliani and Romney, who is leading the important snap elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his tenure as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing illegal immigrants in his home.
Both fighters became particularly fierce when asked if they would be willing to promote "amnesia" (offering illegals regular status and the opportunity to become citizens).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, have managed to delve deeper into this topic.
Neither of them has the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps thanks to the fact that they began to fight immigration before and more incisively than the others.
In general, the candidates, at least regarding immigration, have the same opinions: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This topic, combined with concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys made in China, or many other fears about the outside world, favor Republicans to forget, or minimize the divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other topics were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the campaign for gun control.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked if the candidates believed in its entirety the content of the Bible.
This has led Mr. Giuliani to dare to declare the Bible his favorite book, even if he is not sure he believes the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
One did not expect to see Mike Huckabee, – in pole position in Iowa in a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism – declare that the death penalty is painful although necessary.
When it was insisted whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus is too fancy to run for office.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious grant searches conducted by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistles during Wednesday's debate.
These two emerged from nothing, thanks to the fact that the two proteges of the party could not agree on who is the best known and more traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party early and convincingly with a message of success about American greatness, bringing leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour's pains
Gordon Brown has discovered a new hole into which to sink; Even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, this one is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no extra marital toe sucked.
But now a revelation attests that a rich businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), which the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have done without.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister backtracked on his election plan, foolishly insulting British intelligence proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped instead to deliver a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democrat leader, said that the terrifying Mr Brown has transformed himself from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The takeover of Northern Rock, a troubled bank on the verge of crack cocaine, demonstrated a flaw in guidelines and poor judgment in emergencies.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have provoked a coalition of industry groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million pieces of personal data by the tax authorities revealed an incredible administrative blunder.
A trio of retired generals have launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: they have proclaimed that being defence minister is for them, a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of shady donations on the part of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's general secretary (and his former vigilance chief) forced them to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading for the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and don't trust them, but usually leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a Prime Minister cannot improve things, or even govern for long, when he risks suspension: the public administration no longer works; ministers' offices take stock; the press looks for bad stories; And the government becomes on the defensive and without any more objectives.
In a sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his superior lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are linked to Mr Brown's decisions when he was Chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair's woes, such as the lengthy investigation into party funds "cash for members of the House of Lords", voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation facing Mr. Brown is not as tragic as it seems.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as Tory party members would have us believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, though painful, may be to realize Mr. Brown's long-standing Stalinist tendencies in favor of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal over political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very peculiar figure, who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of big political funders are clear, and they exist for good reason: The public has a right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs but did not know it was illegal, will therefore have to be questioned, as will Jon Mendlesohn, the head of grant collections who spoke about the questionable donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: There is no indication that he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival in government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half.
He was quick to condemn his party's legislative flaw, but he did not draw attention to the fact that decision-making power rests on something he knows well, using a committee of inquiry on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been flouted, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chair for the independent committee of the Standards of Public Life, without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the finances of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to work with the Tories, which could lead it to abandon its special financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter like Mr. Brown.
But he would have to face some partisan facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage in the election; He has two years to win back voters, and the only way to win over is to demonstrate impeccable integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see fanned fins, swirling around.
Now that the U.S. housing market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion spreads from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fee and insolvency rates, which measure the shares of the balance sheet that are not or are recoverable more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in consumer credit, partly because of weak cardholders.
Still, it's too early to panic.
Costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% in the third quarter is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in laws in 2005 in the United States, regarding personal bankruptcy caused a precipitous drop in bankruptcy records, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; The number of archives (and therefore insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers must pay.
And confidence in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicted that issuance volume for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct infection links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their debt loads now that fair mortgages are gone.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of cash rather than the value of wealth, and so falling property prices have not necessarily led to a change in borrowers' credibility.
They could even bring benefits to issuers of credit securities.
Consumer premiums for paying mortgages fall if properties cost less than the value of the loan; As a result, credit card debt would become a priority to repay everything.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such stress conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter recurrent limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a quick rally in equities.
"We're not going to wake up one morning and revalue all the borrowing," said Gary Perlin, head of Capital One.
If a financial catastrophe of the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a significant decline.
If lower house prices and a contraction in the credit market push America into recession, the industry will certainly face a macabre future.
Pay close attention to the dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty to Enron.
The three British bankers who were to testify about their roles in a fraud committed by the previous chief financial officer of Enron, Mr. Andrew Fastow, have changed their statements, pleading guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had initially declared themselves innocent of the seven charges of alleged collusive fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to enrich himself in spite of their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing presided over by U.S. Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., they all pleaded guilty to fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland's PLC group, have become famous across Britain because of the two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, their case is still an outstanding question for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 made it clear to Fastow that he was the subject of the government's investigation into the Enron debacle.
The charges against the bankers, dubbed the "Natwest Three" claim to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right-hand man, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped it rig bankruptcy proceedings.
In early 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as zero, but in fact the three Britons already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the subsidiary's bank interest for £1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 as interest for this company.
According to the accuse, Fastow falsely told Enron that the energy company was willing to pay Greenwich NatWest $20 million for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth that $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers got $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endured a six-year incarceration in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcerated for 3 years and one month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three Britons were released on bail of $1 million each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, previously the seventh largest national company, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting rigging, could no longer hide its billions in debt or even offer its bogus speculations as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of layoffs, more than $60 billion in lost market value and more than $2 billion in loss for pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the company's collapse.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
Charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other offenses were unsuccessful because of his death from a heart attack last year.
Neither under nor outside Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"Even if no one really needs that many seats because it's more of a family aircraft or for the president of a company."
Firer was at Gulfstream's booth last Friday at the Millionaires' Fair, a four-day consumer incentive held in a huge exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their booths, hoping to spark the interest of the new rich Russians for their varied products, ranging from mahogany yachts to diamond-filled cars like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was voting a bright orange Porsche, displayed next to his stand.
"It's a nice car, but nothing like our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
"Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, like Dallas"
"We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialistic." said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar in the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University."
Like the Saudis in the 70s, the Japanese in the 90s, the Russians are emerging as the world's biggest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another location in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxury goods to markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, two-thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are worth $670 billion overall, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists from the Center for Economic and Financial Research.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a representative of London jeweler Davis Morris.
She participated in the show for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, Le Groupe Bijoutier de Soho.
"The women are all well prepared and the men are worth a fortune."
Walking around the living room on Sunday evening, the two real estate agents put on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 say they are like their customers, millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who grabbed her haute couture dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The show seems to be aimed primarily at the nouveau riche, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to queue in traffic to come to a huge warehouse where Cadillac Escalades, platinum penknives, Mövenpick ice cream, custom pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears are displayed.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands," said Gijrath, sitting proudly at the Royal Dutch porcelain factory stand Delf, in front of a handmade Raimbrant wall painting on blue tiles.
"It is certain that Russians are more interested in bling bling"
Indeed, the sellers said here that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years is too much by Russian standards) have already gone from bright logos to some kind of limited edition brand that could not sell at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, either millionaires, millionaires' emissaries or tourists, roam the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of silk, cashmere, and cotton mattresses inlaid with gold thread.
On the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also said he sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would sell three bracelet-like cars for Rolls-Royce Phantoms at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it encrusted with Swarovski crystals to look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires," Karapetian said.
He will certainly keep it in his garage that already contains 30 or 40 vehicles."
Even though many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the rising property prices here.
"If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more than you might think"
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the booth of Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company erected four booths representing British phone booths, filled with masses of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 counterfeit tickets for the Millionaire fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw masses of banknotes, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or pocketing a few million.
"You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," Karyev said.
Unlicensed surgeon suspected of homicide in New Jersey
It was Thanksgiving Eve when Ronald Livingston looked out the bay window of Just a Little Healthier and watched an ambulance that had just stopped at the gates of the White Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
and then another.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop," Mr Livingston, a restaurant manager, said Wednesday.
That's when I realized someone had died.
Authorities would later learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if the cause of death was due to an act performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, whom police have not yet identified, residing at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined the cause of Miss Arroyo's death, but they are confidently awaiting the results of toxicology tests which, unfortunately, will take time, but which should solve this mysterious death that has saddened the high ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been Assistant to Police Director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hard-working and tenacious," McCarthy said of Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday. »
"She was like a pit bull"
"She would have done everything to protect me"
Mr McCarthy said Ms Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that she leaves two sons aged 14 and 11, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokeswoman for Union County prosecutor's office, Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died because of unauthorized surgery.
"That's a possibility to consider."
"The investigation is ongoing."
Authorities said they arrived at her home around 3 p.m.
and finding Miss arroyo on the sofa.
She was pronounced dead.
A little more than a week has passed since then, and authorities have said little about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not confirm whether Ms. Castro was questioned by authorities.
Investigators are trying to figure out if part of the house was being used as a doctor's office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Miss Castro's home where a wilted rose bush lies in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barked at the back.
A blue can called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in cooking and for perfumes, lay in a shed, next to a door that leads to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung on the sides.
McCarthy said that since arriving in Newark 25 years ago at the NYPD Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this,'" he said.
"She was there when I arrived, and still there when I left.
'It was embarrassing'
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will lower rates related to the turmoil of the world stock market.
Stocks soared on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm credit conditions, later cutting interest rates promoted by the soothing statements of the vice president of the US central bank.
Stock markets are exploding in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, said those who decide must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in turbulent financial markets.
In an apparent effort to reassure irritable markets in light of these new credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulence has in part "reversed some improvements in market functioning in late September and October.
Should this harsh turbulence persist, it would increase the likelihood of further rigidity in financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into US markets, and that further interest rate cuts could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped calm Wall Street with even worse news about the US economy, such as the biggest drop in real estate sales for the month of October.
The repercussions of this financial tumult were accentuated following the statement of Bear Stearns, investment bank, announcing that it will lay off 650 people, that is, 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to the losing bets of mortgages.
Only 20 positions are planned in London where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of the Dow Jones rose by 331 points, or 2.55% concluding at 13,289.40 while the largest index, S&P 500, took 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index gained 165.5 points or 2.7% concluding at 6306.2 adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
Germany's Dax index rose 2.6% and France's CAC40 rose 2.3%.
Earlier, the re-emergence of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted by the strong demand for an auction of tri-monthly funds issued by the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at the heavy rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and inject further funds into London's financial markets causing credit stresses, meant that the tri-monthly borrowing rates "Libor" British banks, caused their highest growth since last September, at 6.59% following a sharp rise since November 12.
England are facing a call for judgment over criticism from Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be England's No. 6 drummer in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in such a broad context as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of the coaches who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, in making his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the chief executive officer of England, is starting to fill out the application forms to become a national coach,  at least part time.
Whoever fails to win bib No. 6 will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and so is sport.
It is never easy to destroy what allows one man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck more than for lack of skill.
It is not only in cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is the right time to bring out Bopara?
Is this fair in relation to Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, who to choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; Both, new professionals with good professional qualifications, should be promoted: but there is room for only one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless he is given at least one chance?
Numbers matter in decisions, but also in opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must capture the eye of the captain, at the same time he must take the door and a batsman must be lucky to touch the cricketer for a day.
But capturing the eyes of selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself in great shape and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class gates over 33 laps to earn one spot.
Chris Tremlett has only taken 29 at the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer again.
Whether it will be Shah or Bopara playing at the Asgiriya Stadium, it is only a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well in the first, with five gates and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the primary cricketer of the Test, despite the fact that his double hundred scored against Australia in Australia may still be underestimated.
Likelihood predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and favor Shah's greater experiment against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start at the Test of 88 in Mumbai, 32 first-class cents against six for Bopara, who at 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at launch.
But Shah made only ten rounds in his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test at Lord, his Middlesex playing hometown, and that, the immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan again in form, claimed his place for the next match, seems to have afflicted his obvious impulses in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joie de vivre.
Nothing scares him on a cricket pitch and he exaggerated when he recently crashed on a 4x4 during a presentation by Volkswagen, sponsor of England.
He reported only minor injuries, was shocked, even if the first thing he did was take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was watching him from afar, to ask him if "he saw that?"
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his shooting pace allows him to make services that suit him, and that he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe this is the true art of selection?
I would be propitious to give Bopara a chance, which is not to say that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, it will be him who plays this weekend.
The buses take people back to work, and to fight against al Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, pouring out these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others hoping the city has returned to normalcy.
Some have returned to fight against activists who have kept them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival from Damascus of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned on their own.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdas," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now."
"They say the Mahdi army no longer commits crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of church activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who have forced his men to move away for the time being.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and the regime prevents Iraqis from working.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him to inform him that the US-backed militia had driven Al Qaeda out of the west of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he incited citizens to rebel against al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me they had set up an anti-al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm going back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have been attracted by the growing lull in the capital since U.S. troops arrived, and at the sight of continued training of well-armed "groups of involved citizens" collaborating with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhood.
But still others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decline of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, expressed everyone's suspicion about visas for exiles, Prime Minister Shia Nouri al-Maliki, reportedly asking the Syrian government to limit to force people to return home.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
"We had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," Sunni said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left."
The decrease in violence can be partly explained by the fact that Sunnis have been driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are lower.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees could again increase sectarian tensions and bring back fighting.
Small Saarland, good training.
The smallest federated state leads in vocational training, and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Saarland, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I exliquated yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Saar, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-mockery, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the Saarland training system, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher education institutions cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Saarbrücken in 1948 by the French.
Until now, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or even triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high proportion of 15.6 per cent of international students.
Saarland also leads the country's children to higher than average schools - many of them without a diploma from the Gymnasium.
"In Saarland, we benefit from the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, training expert at IW.
More than one in five young people obtain their qualification from a vocational school, so Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are therefore relatively well developed.
In terms of the number of inhabitants, the dual curriculum panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
This is why the Saar Ministry of Education has obliged higher education institutions to carry out a marketing campaign in engineering science subjects.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government has introduced comparison tests throughout the federal state.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of creche is duty-free - a model that other federated states are also copying in the meantime.
Only future comparison studies can show whether pupils' performance is improving sustainably.
In PISA studies in 2003, the proportion of at-risk students was reduced from 29 to 20 per cent.
Overall, however, the Saar has not improved as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians are doing better.
And much to the dismay of the Saarland, foreign language skills are not measured by PISA studies – otherwise you could earn points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbor is compulsory in high schools - even if the Saarland are not French.
Chávez adjusts the watches
In Venezuela, watches will soon be ticking differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will raise the clock by half an hour in the South American country.
Chavez has meanwhile become a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela communicated, due to a new law, watches will be set to less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country gets a time zone that does not exist in any other state in the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position among other things by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones into peak hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighboring country, Colombia, because of a hostage case.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would have no relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't, already only because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is hastening a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil-rich country will have to vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, he would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate for negotiations on the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "spat in the face" of Venezuela with this decision, Chávez criticized Sunday.
In Spain also Chávez is in everyone's mouth.
A new mobile phone ringtone is all the rage in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (why don't you shut up) is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded on the internet.
It was delivered by the King of Spain Juan Carlos who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was annoyed by the constant questioning of left-wing populists and told him to shut up.
A wage cut threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, according to one forecast, a real loss in salary is threatening German employees this year.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect a real reduction in their pay slips in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault lies with the weak development of wages, the increase in value-added tax and the rise in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research told the Bild newspaper.
New charges could also arise in terms of unemployment insurance for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung newspaper that the planned 3.3 percent reduction in unemployment insurance for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, in the words of the SPD politician.
It was announced on Tuesday that soaring food and hydrocarbon prices had pushed the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices were up 3.0 per cent year over year.
Venus is Earth's infernal twin.
Despite its atmosphere hostile to life, Venus looks more like Earth than previously believed: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and swirls of wind at the poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lightning bolts on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" today proved this - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: lightning on Venus bursts at a height of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California at Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous theory of cyprin, lightning would have made life appear on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If there was life, it must have been at a very ancient date in history," says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there should be hardly any living things on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be Earth's infernal twin, but it's still a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and dimensions, was struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ESA mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important milestone in the Venusian search, since no probe had been on its way to explore this planet since the nineties.
In the researchers' opinion, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several articles in "Nature" do not only highlight the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the similarities with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more numerous than assumed at first glance.
Thus, the researchers found, in addition to the wind vortices already known at the North Pole, a whirlwind of clouds at the South Pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the Earth's hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet known as the evening or morning star revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much more slowly on itself: a Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, bears little reminiscent of Earth, scientists speculate that the two planets formed under similar conditions.
Of both, water accumulated and remained on Earth as oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has fixed itself on Earth as carbonate, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he was criticising the SPD because of the attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's appearance and summons the grand coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We must not present to the outside world a nation divided on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed sympathy for Chancellor Angela Merkel's (CDU) welcome of the Dalai Lama in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for differences between cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a significant balance in foreign policy, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against accusations that she would organize a new policy of China.
The German chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional one-China policy.
"China knows it too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly voiced his dissatisfaction with the Dalai Lama's hosting and had been attacked for it outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained in particular about the CDU's "forward policy" in foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama's welcome to the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese government has not only removed German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to information from Der Spiegel, has also frozen the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is now demanding German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledge that hosting the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refuses to allow European politicians to receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official duties, supported Wen Jiabao's position.
The Dalai Lama's words and deeds would show that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also includes other present-day provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fights with police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Every effort must be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not erupt in the streets through violence, demanded the German Minister of the Interior.
Barricades burning, thugs shooting at the police with hunting rifles: after the serious riots of young people in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not also form its way in our country and defuses itself in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the "Neue Presse" published in Hanover.
Not all young people would be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federated states and the municipalities were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
It would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, this is already showing its first successes."
But it would be too early for an end of alert.
Schäuble points out at the same time that in the German suburbs there are no sociological problems either from the point of view of urban planning as in France.
In the northern Paris agglomerations, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings burned.
Greater integration efforts on the part of the German government were demanded by the President of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Given the riots in France, Kolat warned of "imitation effects."
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat points out that the quota of unemployed among young people under 25 with an immigrant background is said to be higher than average.
Above all, more training places should be provided.
Kolat insisted: "We need to give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish Communities added, however, that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young people with an immigrant background do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged, "But we still have to be careful."
Young people should be given the opportunity to participate in work and training as soon as possible.
Meanwhile, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter flew over the area with searchlights.
Authorities in office reported three arrests as well as a few burned cars and garbage cans.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces has ensured calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the troubles overflowed in Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two youths lost their lives on Sunday.
According to initial information from the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of the youths.
In Angela Merkel's empire.
The Chancellor's utopian entry into the scene shows that the coalition is done with substance - and that there is nothing more to expect from her.
In which country does this chancellor live?
After her distressing speech in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country that should, in the end, be governed by it.
The reproach of focusing too much on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel with a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It's provincial, she said, and only showed that she doesn't want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, it made it clear to everyone how accurate this reproach was.
There was no concrete interest or feeling for the country's problems to feel.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a weightless politician who flees into foreign policy and even there remains in the rough edge.
For example, climate protection: in this respect, it welcomes again and again the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how the climate objectives will have to be achieved in our country.
Even, the praise of oneself - having so little modesty, the leader of the CDU would have refused it again two years ago.
Now it clings to ready-made formulas, that growth would affect people.
In this way it destroys its image as a pragmatist, who solves problems instead of beautifying the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic political problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
He has a few minor sentences left for this.
In this matter is revealing the number of times she makes slips of the tongue when it comes to family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to pronounce a half-precise sentence.
She staggers in uncharted territory, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the YouTube debate of Republican presidential candidates, the two frontrunners Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle — and must now fear an underdog candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already erupting on the first subject.
He would have made New York a "refuge for illegals," reproaches Mitt Romney to his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
The latter against his side by heavy reproaches: "I would say that his own house was a haven for illegals," replies Giuliani and accuses the former governor of Massachusetts of having employed undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are on the attack: since the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that internet users have sent via Youtube are little more than blowers.
"It is with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power," says John McCain to his candidate Ron Paul who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney, too, is being vigorously lectured by Vietnam veterans when he refuses to condemn as torture so-called "waterboarding," a method of interrogation that simulates drowning.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign now go beyond the war in Iraq and the debates on torture can be seen in the reactions of the common room in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Whether conservative values are praised or future tax hikes are rejected, applause pours into the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favorites reveal.
"I made a mistake at that time," Romney says contrite and apologizes to the base and television audiences for still being a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, goes through a noose when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigned in civilian clothes for the first time.
A day after his retirement as army chief, Pakistani powerman Musharraf was sworn in as president.
Thus eight years of domination by the army ended.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for another five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf has vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday he handed over his position as head of the armed forces to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bowed to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power in a bloodless coup, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil status.
By removing the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf declared on November 3.
Already shortly after his inauguration, Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfill another demand of the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf held after the state of emergency was declared with lawyers from his ranks, last week rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of Krautrock are back.
The supergroups of Germany of the seventies are playing again: the three members of the group Harmonia have once again taken their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return were released recordings of their great hit "Live 1974".
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening bill.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
He is flanked to the left by Michael Rother, a 57-year-old with a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends over his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including even a Beat.
And sometimes it inadvertently adds up to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves too much.
The fact that the band Harmonia is playing again has ensured some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted polls reveal that, certainly, the name reasons in the collective memory of pop, but in no way so durably for this group to be so painfully missed for 32 years.
But why shouldn't German also have the right to celebrate its living legends of the seventies?
Especially since what is deceptively called "Krautrock" has always been more popular in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize in 2003 to the survivors of the Cologne band Can for their work, we saw in the room the questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! In the eulogy, astonishment had no limits.
Later, during concerts, Michael Rother would jump on the Red Hot Chili Peppers stage like an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration into the unknown is the one and only.
The memory is therefore already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and during this period, the power of impact that was felt was much lower than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We first played in the cellars below the Berlin stage.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly worked out in Kraftwerk and eventually made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, which at the time was perhaps the most radical German band.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile in the forests of Weserbergland.
There, in an old Weser farmhouse, a 16th century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Kommune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the manner of Spitzweg.
Supposedly in the trash bin was a pennant of the Harmonia Ottenstein choir and also a name for art.
Many kept Harmonia away from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next "De Luxe".
Because as serene and modest as the music sounded, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvesting of dead wood alone was not used for self-searching.
The CD "Live 1974" that has just been released was recorded during a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of nearly 50 heads, as someone thinks he remembers.
Rother expressed at that time the wish to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
This was an immoral demand for Roedelius and Moebius.
The band announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and ensured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster revived in the eighties and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe Griessem's album Live to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland has set itself the goal of nurturing Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been unearthed on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the paperback "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire fluctuation band of Krautrock's influence would be identified with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's phrase hovers in the room amid the singular sounds: "The only real music, you listen to the future".
There are photos that show the producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white photos of tools wired in bazaar are used to form the legend.
In front, the three veterans are once again busy improvisation.
But no more by gluing microphones to the organ and drums, to draw incredible sounds to the instruments thanks to the instruments with effects built yourself.
Today, electronic music resembles electronic music.
The three as great technical falters.
Even the choir of the house will not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It's never about rock.
The roots have been sought less in the blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the flight of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever shouts "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia too is no longer irritated by this anymore.
But what is most self-evident will be covered meticulously on the stage.
Where does the music begin and where does it end?
It can hit someone's nerves (?) or grant fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Deadly Peace", two films once again address the Balkan war.
But both are not convincing.
Either the projects rely too much on action and senseless exchanges of fire or, on the contrary, they are too tearful.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, it is precisely there, in the most gloomy hinterland of the Bosnian war, that the actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had finally lost sight of the most handsome man of the eighties, because far too many nice roles and fusils in films with feelings for women and far too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism delighted him with the desire to show off.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument for watching "The Hunting Party" anyway - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why do today's movies have to be as long and confusing as locomotive drivers' collective agreements?)
He delivers a magnificent representation full of winks: at heart, his character as a war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if fate and the film industry were not so benevolent: a man who has his best moments in a long time behind him, but who, even as a ruined monument to his decline,  has, however, kept visible remnants of its former charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Deadly Peace", which also releases this week, the endless series of failed films on the Balkan war.
From "Murderous Peace" we can quickly make the trial: the film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovar snipers, in whom one of the two still quickly falls in love.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not for once presented as the only causes of all evil, this film as flat as a TV movie is lost far too quickly in the action and the senseless exchanges of fire.
It remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, we can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why in the end there has never been a really good film about the Balkan war.
The story of the three American war reporters, who condition themselves to track the high war criminal "the fox", could perhaps have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go in small teams into the forest, to accomplish something the military cannot do and for both males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is simply not allowed to be the deserted cynic with a heart, as he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute to him a romantic affair with a Bosnian woman who was later murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitively bad, when the reporter, in the space of the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, manages to get NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters of the world have not succeeded in five years: catch the war criminal and leave him for a just revenge to the Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that we should refer the matter to the International Court in The Hague for crimes against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and he suspects that the Americans and the French (here they must exceptionally agree) do not conduct the hunt intensively enough because of secret political agreements.
But the well-intentioned and the villain are so similar this time that a famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
The one speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compassionate, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how tiring it is to be wicked."
Movies such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but they insinuate how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been good films about South Africa before.
Which is worth every time: when a star hangs out on a crisis hotspot or minefield, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits aller Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
Regardless, decades have always passed before Hollywood could make a good Holocaust movie with "Schindler's List."
Some films still need to mature - those that today are worth classic works about Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were by no means unanimously celebrated in their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we also know today simply too much about the conflicts of the world, where each hecatomb arrives live on two screens at the same time at home,
And it robs the writers of the lack of scruples they need to tell great stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The dictator" actually became as good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you shouldn't want to be good when you want to make good flims.
Perhaps we need to have the sarcastic and distanced artistic gaze of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionnaire de Lemprière" and the Balkan war, he replied: "It's only because some things never change."
"Big cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be murdered in horrifying ways, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust reaps criticism for the cancellation of the Olympiad.
The mayor's retreat from Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has come up against fierce criticism in politics and economics.
Many want to continue fighting for the Games by the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the assessment of chances.
The senior director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday described an abandonment as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project has deployed as many motivating forces in the city as the idea of the Olympiad.
"Without this objective, the political-sporting momentum could not have been maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new starting point for it in the longer term, "which takes as a starting point another modified agenda".
Mayor Ole von Beust on Wednesday stuck to his previous statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on a bid for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Sports Federation at the beginning of December, regarding Munich's bid for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us that, in the time frame we had planned until 2028 until then, we will have no chance."
But the dream is not definitively a thing of the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
From this the impression would be given that Hamburg no longer wants to bid for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity, burying the projects already now," HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the candidacy would also contradict the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the hosting in full assembly of the German Federation of Higher Sports Schools.
There, Von Beust reportedly described Hamburg's bid for the 2015 Universiade as "not a substitute" for the Hamburg Olympics.
The Federation of Higher Sports Schools had first nominated Hamburg as a candidate city in the past weeks.
The mayor's SPD faction criticised the Senate for not using this precious time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of Petit Grasbrook was rejected by the Senate for years because it played the Olympiad card and ruled out the construction of housing," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for a plan for Petit Grasbrook to be integrated into the Olympiad and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have relied exclusively on the "Event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics would have aroused great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, broke up against Leipzig.
These are not Warhols' coffers.
The one who connects the concepts Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or what if?
Right now, wooden crates made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol's list of works.
Many of the ninety "Stockholm Type" Brillo-Boxes listed there are counterfeiters.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned a few months ago the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968, the internal research of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm today leads to a disenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the museum Pontus Hulten donated in 1995 to the Moderna Museet,  are copies - as well as much of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which circulate on the international art market.
Ancient history is entangled, a disconcerting sequence of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of the "Brillo" powdered soap cartons.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 presented - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to have some Brillo wooden crates produced in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time speak today of about fifteen wooden boxes that at the time would have entered the history of art and auctions, as original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Wahrol authorized, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached more than $100,000 in auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later claimed that about a hundred wooden crates had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would then have ceded to him.
In truth, Hultén's 105 crates were produced in Malmö only in 1990, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By then, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined three others from private Swedish collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968, alongside the museum's six Brillo-Boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminate panels were first printed and sanded, then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The texture of the copies, which date from the year 1990, reveals on the contrary that the paint was directly applied without a base layer on the laminate panels, using a paint roller - moreover it is not an oil paint, but an acrylic.
"These crates have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from Andy Warhol's official list of Brillo-Boxes," suggests Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six crates in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
Already in July the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the "heavy accusations" that will be raised in the case of boxes of soap powder.
But since then, there has been an inexorable silence.
Rebel Soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers are giving up, the same ones who had holed up in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the president for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel that he could not answer for any bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to power had stormed the hotel with tear gas shortly before.
The two dozen soldiers had been holed up in the building for hours.
About half of them were standing in court on Wednesday because of a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly slip away with about 30 supporters.
The military police, who were normally supposed to monitor them, had apparently deserted in his favour and joined his mutiny.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Troops loyal to the government cordoned off the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Councilor Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers' action.
"People have had enough," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
Gen. Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the elite Scout Rangers unit, said other army units wanted to join the march soon.
Critics of the regime had called for a large demonstration against the president on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
Manila's financial district had already been the scene of an attempted mutiny by about 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection broke down nearly 24 hours later when the army refused to join.
Since 1986 there have already been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet secured a more than 20 percent stake in telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as communicated by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of the registered capital would be held.
We had already speculated before on a takeover.
The option would remain open to further increase the stake in Versatel.
With this step we seek to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet has communicated.
Just before, speculation had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf-based network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institute would hold the money only for a third part, it is said on the market.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a nearly 10 percent stake in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares worth €106.4 million on the stock exchange.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, the companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL and mobile phone products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesperson said.
The two companies founded the joint venture MSP in order to absorb the competitor Freenet.
For now, the two companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not make use of their right to endorse an additional 18.49 percent in Freenet, United Internet said Thursday.
The two companies would, however, leave all options open, especially to increase the stake in Freenet SA, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet over a strategic partnership ended in mid-October.
The poker still difficult to predict on Freenet that has been going on for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile customers and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions at the end of the third quarter.
The holding company of United Internet and Drillisch previously held a direct interest in Freenet of 6.01 percent.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will contribute about four percent more.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
