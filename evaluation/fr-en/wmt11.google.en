What will happen? CSSD doesn&#39;t know Voldemort or pastry shop in Prague.
The newly elected CSSD mayors of the capital will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand each other at the level of the municipal council with their old and new colleagues from the ODS.
The daily Actualne.cz &quot;tested&quot; the new members of the city council belonging to CSSD, whether they know the slang that was born in the last years at the town hall, when they were the partners of the current coalition who ruled in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the political cream of Prague set in motion during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is with surprise that it was discovered that the newly elected do not understand very well the known terms.
Or so they say.
&quot;Who is Valdemort&quot;.
&quot;I really do not know&quot;.
“I am a youngster in Prague politics, reacted Lukas Kaucky, the elected official for culture, to the test of the “godfather” vocabulary.
And as for the political veteran, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example the meaning of &quot;golf hole&quot;.
&quot;It is the only expression among those that you propose to me that I use&quot;
Otherwise, I don&#39;t use slang.
From the vocabulary, the expressions of which the daily Aktualne.cz published in June this year before the pre-election congress of the ODS, the editorial staff chose 6 examples, in priority those which are connected with the town hall of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of &quot;Voldemort&quot;, &quot;the biggest golf hole in Prague&quot;, go to the pastry shop&quot;, &quot;blackjack&quot;, &quot;betrayal of the capital&quot; and &quot;entole&quot;.
Three of the elected agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who is to lead education in Prague in the future - first promised an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek flatly refused the test.
&quot;I don&#39;t care at all about these things and how the representatives of citizen democracy have fun: I will not give my opinion.&quot;
&quot;I am currently dealing with how we will understand each other within the framework of our programs&quot;, he reacted.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would apparently not recognize in the caption above, that it is about the influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the ex-mayor Roman Bem.
&quot;Voldemort&quot; says nothing to Kaucky and the only phrase he guessed in the test is &quot;the biggest golf hole in Prague&quot;.
&quot;It&#39;s about the Blanka tunnel&quot; says Kaucky and immediately adds: &quot;But I know it from the newspapers&quot;.
&quot;I&#39;m going to have to pay for a language course,&quot; he jokes.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the chosen one for the environment, know that the golf hole is Blanko&#39;s tunnel.
Both Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks in the sense of &quot;going to the pastry shop&quot;.
“It is, I think, going to a company,” Plachy is ready to guess that this is the headquarters of Janousek&#39;s companies.
On the same tone Brezina reminds that he draws his knowledge rather from newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the test takers there is no lexicon of slang in social democracy.
&quot;I took advice with colleagues and it appears that we really don&#39;t have anything of this type.&quot;
&quot;We rather say names to each other sometimes we use abbreviations and symbols,&quot; said Peter Hlinsky, Chairman of the Social Democratic Party, which Party members call Hulda.
&quot;They called me Briza at school but I don&#39;t know if my colleagues call me that, admits Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The daily Actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Grandpa for the members of the Party or else the less friendly Old man, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by the scams during the sponsorship of the party, is nicknamed &quot;the little toy &quot;.
Nicknames are also the only ones that Social Democrats admit to using inside the party.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda very much, but the daily Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
&quot;Doctor of Laws with batons&quot; apparently recalls that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title of Doctor of Laws JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of &quot;witches&quot;, published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
They are rather part of the older generation, cannot work for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes a &quot;witch&quot; is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
&quot;Man very rarely has this destiny&quot;.
“Young women are also not judged to be healthy because they participate in labor and give birth to children,” says a sister who looks after in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special establishment. of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government decided to intervene against this unusual &quot;social measure&quot;.
He has published a pamphlet which should help limit the witch hunt.
The case has a &quot;hiccup&quot;.
&quot;More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,&quot; the Die Standard daily warned of the downside of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighboring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with kerosene they had sprayed on her.
It was the BBC server that transmitted this information.
Criminals claim it was the evil eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual anointings ignited on contact with the woman.
The oil allegedly flared up when the team wanted to &quot;drive out the evil spirit&quot; from the woman.
The insulation of &quot;witches&quot; is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: &quot;The eaters of human spirits have always represented a danger&quot;, he said.
As Burkina Faso strives to curb the witch hunt, The Gambia as recently as last year even saw the President himself take part.
&quot;The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide hunt for the witches who, it seems, participated in his death and endeavored by black magic to kill the President as well.&quot;
&quot;Shamans from nearby Guinea came to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of policemen and the personal guard of the President, men and women chosen at random from villages in The Gambia&quot;, indicated in a message the organization &quot;Amnesty International.
On the farm the imprisoned people had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects which also caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive it.
Due to international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
The tenant from Bakal: The stoves are heating up, he signed a higher rent.
A towering elderly man walked out the door of the customer center of the RPG Byty company of &quot;coal baron&quot; Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his own, that of his daughter and his son who is serving a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 apartment of the second category 4100 crowns.
&quot;And there is no hot water and the heating runs on solid fuel,&quot; the man with signing authority points to his son&#39;s new contract.
“But I signed anyway,” he explains, half angry and half resigned.
Citizens&#39; Association of Apartments BytyOKD.cz, which has described the new rental conditions as &#39;immoral and indecent&#39;, advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published explaining the method to follow to claim.
But the man reacts to this with a wave of his hand.
&quot;One says that, the other says something else&quot; frowning.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what awaits most apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to personally visit the &quot;laboratory&quot;.
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and it is already full on Tuesdays at 09 o&#39;clock in the morning.
Right next to the door stands a guard from a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, &quot;rent 2011&quot;, is lit on the touch screen.
One press and a paper with a number comes out of the device.
You don&#39;t have time to read your number &quot;157&quot; when your number is already starting to light up on the big screen under the roof of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second it&#39;s your turn.
After a short while, an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rents don&#39;t seem to concern the people in the waiting room.
The majority of people came to deal with common problems like everywhere - request for repairs, events concerning insurance and others.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 apartments in RPG&#39;s portfolio have been receiving letters with new rental contracts in their mailboxes since around mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
the special counter for new rents has been open to the public since 18 November.
&quot;It&#39;s been working for nearly a week, so it&#39;s still being tested,&quot; replies, after a moment&#39;s hesitation, the employee behind the counter when the customer introduces himself as a journalist.
The deragulation and the former apartments of Bakal miners are a very sensitive local subject.
Deputy Speaker of Parliament and a native of the Ostrava region Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats reported on this quite forcefully before the elections and it now fills the local newspapers.
&quot;20 years later, I want a new floor&quot;.
&quot;They didn&#39;t even change a damn board in the toilets, the man mentioned relieves himself in the introduction.
However, it is mostly, according to the employees, retirees who come to be sure that they will receive a discount on the new price of rent if they sign now as promised by RPG in a special offer.
It is a rebate of half the amount of the rent that the other tenants who will have signed their new contract before December 15 will receive.
But the &quot;deregulation&quot; counter on Havirovaska Street is really not overwhelmed with questions.
&quot;Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for the rent,&quot; said the employee at the counter.
And yet RPG offers both on its website and in the windows individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If the two parties do not agree on the rent, an independent court will make the decision.
&quot;These are not threats but only to inform on the unique and legitimate way to act legally,&quot; says RPG on its website.
“No one will go to court here,” thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty, and the man in the street outside the customer center proves her right.
&quot;I have 13,000 crowns for retirement and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don&#39;t have enough to go to court,&quot; he said.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
&quot;We will see&quot;.
&quot;Mr. Zaoralek in the media is asking that no one sign and so people are waiting,&quot; she says.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and the increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
&quot;And, moreover, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund&quot;, recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that it is precisely negligence housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with rents to invest in apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the Havirosvka Street waiting room, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
&#39;The rent increase in 2011 is 15 per cent and concerns no fewer than 31,200 apartments, or more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments&#39;.
“And it will always be at most 7.50 Czech crowns per m² per month,” the screen reads.
The 38 per cent increase concerns only 400 apartments in RPG&#39;s portfolio.
&quot;In these cases, it is an increase of a really very low sum of 19.66 Czech crowns per m²&quot;, adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a drastic but gradual increase over 4-8 years.
She adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (see the graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the rent increase agreement have priority.
The kindergarten is also part of the offices, including the architects.
the Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
Nobody could have expected that it also houses a mini kindergarten with all the right things - colored walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch employees can go there. design.
The project-architectural company Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, imagined his mini company kindergarten from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building.
It employs around 90 people, mostly of childbearing age, and it was important to her that female architects and project managers be able to return to work quickly.
Along with reduced-time work contracts, kindergarten is a bonus offered to its employees by the Arch company. Design. as part of its social program.
Builders and architects thus have the possibility of combining demanding work with care for children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design.themselves who imagined this nursery school and with the support of the management they were able to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.
The mini kindergarten is financed by means of the European Social Fund through the operational program of human resources and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to funding allocations (up to 2.8 mil.de Czech crowns). They were able to buy equipment and devices and after two years provide qualified personnel and start-up.
After using the funding grant (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and it was the company Economy rating which helped to apply for the grant.
Care for the children is provided by qualified staff, all day long a nurse and a kindergarten teacher take care of the children. children can go to kindergarten without any age limit, but most of them are over three years old.
As it is a &quot;mini kindergarten&quot; there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who replace each other.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all the employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although it is individual care and education, the mini kindergarten curriculum is comparable to that for preschool education.
The children don&#39;t just play there, but quality education is also provided - from the beginning to the preparation for the school benches, English is taught.
The classroom is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that the children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can control their child at any time and not have the stress of being late to pick up the children from a school far from the parents&#39; place of work.
Parents therefore use their work time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty is created between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design. has thus registered among the companies which offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and which are friendly towards the family and through this program reinforces the HR marketing.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look inside Gaudi&#39;s interiors.
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase resembles the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies resemble the mouths of open fish.
This is how the house Casa Battlo in Barcelona by the architect Antoni Gaudi looks like.
Due to its organic shapes, the house has earned the nickname Bone House from the locals.
Organic shapes, wild colours, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaics, facade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present curves, this is all that is typical for Antoni Gaudi&#39;s Art Nouveau.
The front facade of the house unfolds its dreamy lines, pleasant colors and textures that recall nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation one sees the geometry, the rhythm and the order thought out with precision.
At night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brilliant colors is enhanced.
The coiling and twisting of forms also appears in the interiors with equal measure.
The wood copies in waves the window frames, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the peephole and the slats.
The Battlo house which stands in the Eixample district in the Passeig de Gracia shopping street at number. 43, was born from the construction of a house in 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, initially insisted on demolishing the old building and building a brand new one but quickly accepted Gaudi&#39;s idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-unit house was not thought up by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that the decorations for a representative apartment of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade were born.
For the façade, other artists and designers also worked.
The joint work for the Casa Battlo house plans began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi&#39;s Casa Mila and Park Guell in which there are other works by Gaudi.
Locals dubbed the hot house right after it was finished because of its organic shapes &quot;the Bone House&quot;.
Others, with regard to the specific mechanism of opening the windows, have called it &quot;the house that yawns&quot;.
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint George the patron saint of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the construction contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi designed a unique central heating system for the house, with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
Their 45 degree inclination seems odd.
During the creation Gaudi completely disregarded the building guidelines of that time and did not allow himself to be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the building permit, knowing, of course, that the data given on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the finishing the city council was horrified and asked for changes.
It did not please, for example, the members of the municipal council that the pillars of the building encroached on the public sidewalk.
There was never any modification, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call from the city Josep Battlo requested (and obtained satisfaction) the authorization to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room, and on the third a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase which leads to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were canceled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of linking spaces.
The common part can be completely connected by opening the doors of the lounges and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit the private space for more intimate conversations.
The house with Gaudi&#39;s reconstruction received besides new facades a non-traditional roof and two more floors.
Gaudi&#39;s play with light is also impressive, with the blue and white glazed tiles with which the inner courtyard is decorated and with the skylights.
The two-color game gives maximum light to all floors of the house.
It was enough simply to bet on the principle that the white reflects more than the dark which on the contrary absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house which was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous designer.
They continued the tours as they found it to be a lucrative business and they expanded the scope of tours to common areas and the attic including the roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders get 20 percent off.
The sum is nevertheless above the price of entry in the other constructions of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you need to quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and completely visit the house.
How to choose a mattress and a box spring: women have different criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for sleeping, so the mattress and the box spring provide a real basis for a good bed.
They must of course complement each other harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are decisive: the weight, the height, the age, the state of health as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and box spring will be placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example in the country house where one does not sleep continuously latex mattresses are not suitable because they &quot;warm up&quot; slowly.
They also weigh more than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to turn them over frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain humidity. Mold can also form there.
Habit is also a determining factor in the choice.
Anyone who spends most of their time abroad, where very thick mattresses with a softening layer are frequently used, will hardly feel comfortable on a low, hard surface.
&quot;That&#39;s how all the hockey players coming back from the NHL complain that they can&#39;t sleep there.&quot;
&quot;For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam.&quot;
&quot;Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder who therefore poorly assume &quot;information&quot; from the joints and the skin&quot;, explains Sylva Adamczikova who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That&#39;s why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hokeyists as well as other customers.
“Today everything is going well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico, for example, have suitable mattresses.
You don&#39;t have to be an NHL guy to enjoy lazy foam.
This &quot;miracle&quot; simply works.
It optimizes its rigidity and its shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won&#39;t turn around in the night like after a tough game.
You just sleep better.
The lazy foam also works as a protection against pressure ulcers.
For the choice of mattress according to your height, add the length of the feet, which is approximately 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or a total of 180 cm.
For single beds, singles for example, it is recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
It is convenient when visiting.
&#39;However there is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when lying on your back you should rest your hands comfortably with your elbows slightly bent. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Bourreliers-mattresses and decorators who has devoted herself for several years to the issue of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and teaches it in specialized schools.
For a double bed everyone needs their own box spring and mattress, so be careful when buying to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only have to mount the bed base at different heights and this is not possible on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, from this count for the shape and ventilation layer at least three centimeters.
&quot;To the touch or while sitting on the mattress you should not feel the springs&quot;, warns Héléna Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a specific type of box spring.
The box spring bed, when the mattress and the box spring are united like Siamese twins, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses ventilate very badly; it should not be washed, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night we normally perspire from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years the mattress begins to resemble a large (and clogged) sieve.
For this, specialists refuse to advertise a 25-year lifespan for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But everything to his but.
And for that, a piece of advice from the sellers: for a 120/140cm mattress, forgo hygiene or washing for the mattress cover, but rather add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash. .
And although nowadays it is common to manufacture covers with zipper for the whole set, that is, after opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine this is very important!) otherwise the manipulation for the large models (and for one person) becomes when they are removed a fight between a lightweight and a heavyweight in a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a box spring?
Never!
Maximum for a bed intended for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are none) with ventilation holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with bag springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an ventilation layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of such a bed.
For single position slatted bases with 14/18 slats, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are the ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more slats, 28 and above, where the slats are doubled in the lower part of the kidneys and it is thus possible to regulate their stiffness.
For mattresses with several positions, do not take a spring mattress because it does not respond to changes in position.
Besides adjusting the stiffness of the slats, a so-called shoulder cradle can also be installed.
This is a special connection of the slats which makes it possible to put pressure or even to tilt the slat so that the shoulder of the sleeper &quot;integrates&quot; well.
For men who have &quot;shoulders as wide as their backs&quot; this is really a big thing.
This thing is already being considered by mattress manufacturers, who for &quot;males&quot; have begun to use a softening zone in the shoulder area.
But they also think about women - again they offer them a softer surface on the hips.
For the more difficult customer there are wing or platelet bases with so-called multi-force suspension.
The pressure spreads to more points and decreases the tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated with air) on good mattresses and box springs, the &quot;plus&quot; disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow should support the head, and its points should reach only the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm which Scandinavians for example prefer.
When lying on your side, the pillow should level (with the shoulder cradle of the box spring or the softened area in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first ones made from straw and grass.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also towards organic mattresses.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is made, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all well-known manufacturers use soybeans.
&quot;The qualifier Bio for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products&quot;, explains Petr vasicek of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coverings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop scents of the forest or lavender.
There are differences between man and woman.
While the birch plant extract for the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, &quot;cools&quot; the man, the covers &quot;heat&quot; the women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore hotter for the weaker sex.
Current favourites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disrupted cell structure therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different stiffnesses of cold foams results in polyzone mattresses that know precisely where the head, lower back and feet are.
You will pay for a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those that are characterized by their health parameters have less TVA and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex took first place.
Saving for the mattress and box spring is not easy.
One can from time to time have within the framework of special actions on behalf of the manufacturers or the producers two mattresses for the price of only one.
Like for example the company Magniflex which offers Duofreeze mattresses with Memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
You can obviously take the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and great thickness was started with Tempur material at a &quot;cosmic&quot; pace.
It started out as material for NASA because astronauts started out with enormous load factors.
Tempur softens in the heat and hardens, on the contrary, in the cold.
It therefore adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure to it.
It is therefore ideal against bad sleep and for increased comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot cushions that relieve the legs and the venous system.
Czech manufacturers use, for example, EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or similar.
Devices to track people are increasingly requested by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child leads more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars, can just as well be used to trace the movement of people and help with certain cases such as that of little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a matchbox but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka moved many people and they began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
&quot;We are trying to tell everyone that this is not espionage but just another way to decrease the likelihood of another tragedy,&quot; says Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of tracing devices on the Czech market.
&quot;I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of someone who is not aware, but I have not yet encountered such cases. &quot;.
&quot;The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons,&quot; adds Pilin.
According to him, children should always know what &quot;the box&quot; is used for and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bockova draws attention that if the child does not want to wear such a thing, he will get rid of it.
&#39;And even the little ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something on purpose when they don&#39;t want to be under control&#39;.
&quot;Cellphones, which can shut themselves off like these tracking devices, have already caused parents to have long waits,&quot; Bockova says.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of an attack is very questionable.
&quot;If it is a prepared abduction, the perpetrator will do everything so that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him&quot;.
“Currently, it is the telephone”.
“As soon as the tracing devices are developed, they (the criminals) will look for them too because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign”.
&quot;In such cases the criminals will always be ahead of the police&quot;, says the psychologist.
She admits all the same that such devices can help during an unprepared aggression by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracing services for both cars and people, says having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an attack. .
&quot;The device can be configured in such a way that it is in regular transmission after a determined period&quot;.
&quot;In the event that the device is destroyed, there is still the last position of the person concerned&quot;.
&quot;The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately reports the position of the person who has slipped and ends up in a lying position without moving,&quot; says Cech.
According to him, so-called smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system can offer a comparable service after formatting it with special software.
The problem with current tracing systems is that it is either a device similar to those worn as a pendant the size of a matchbox or to the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina from Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being conducted to make devices that look like common digital watches.
&quot;This will have the advantage that the would-be attacker will not be able to recognize the tracking device.&quot;
“Or he will realize after a while, which will have given the police a little more time,” he adds.
Whether the tracking device is developed as a bracelet or a pendant, it will still use the same technology as for tracking cars.
It is a combination of systems for acquiring a position by means of GPS (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a function of a mobile phone which alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating cords that they could go around the Czech Republic with them. But she can only last two years.
The army purchased 445 km of cord used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defense had purchased 224 km.
The army therefore has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the strings is two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonating cords from the limited company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The general staff gave as reason for the purchase of a huge quantity of detonating cords to MF DNES that the soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations to be kept made by the pyrotechnicians of the army, whom MF DNES contacted, it appears that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or cleaning staff should have an exercise every year at explosives.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defense and Vlastimil Picek, Commander of the Army are no exception.
Only to argue the army&#39;s annual consumption of 60 km of detonating cord.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army reserves could sustain it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it were true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals at most 2 m of detonating cord is enough, as the experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - with also the consumption of special units and engineers - reserves for the mentioned 225 years.
Yet the soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that shooting sessions are limited due to the need for money.
About the lack of underwear we do not talk about it.
&quot;And I don&#39;t mind if they buy such a large quantity of detonating cord from us&quot;.
&quot;And it&#39;s their decision and they really know what they&#39;re doing.&quot;
&quot;For us the army is a good customer that we try as traders to please&quot;, says the commercial director of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argues the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of detonating cords by the fact that the army will have these &quot;ammunitions&quot; in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, reports only four years of service life for detonating cords and police and military pyrotechnicians only two years.
“If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it can even go up to four years”, says one of them who does not want his name to be published in view of the criticism of the army.
Once the service life has passed, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The ministry&#39;s other argument is a quantity discount for 445 km of detonating cord.
&quot;They cost us 60 per cent less than last year&#39;s supply of 245 km,&quot; said spokesman Pejsek, who is interpreting the opinion of defense ministry buyers.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating cords of the pyrotechnicians of the police who neutralize the munitions of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always order only the necessary amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their useful life.
This was established for safety reasons for pyrotechnicians and in addition to being able to obtain more flexible types of detonating cords that are more modern and more reliable.
the ministry of defense has big problems today for the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the strong Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, heading for the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: to neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating cords that it buys today &quot;on the cheap&quot;.
Until today I take advantage of contacts that I obtained thanks to the competitions.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun for the place of winner of the competition for the best individual entrepreneur.
The winner of the Best Individual Entrepreneur competition for the past year was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His journey to success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that Libérec lacked a quality hosting site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments that was half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a third-year graduate student, it was a brave move.
&quot;The ratio between quality and price of accommodation in our region made me want to do something&quot;, says Lucas Pytloun.
He began to rent the first rebuilt apartment to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building which he transformed into a boarding house with 54 beds.
Since then, his action as an entrepreneur has allowed him to open in Libérec 4 boarding houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of these was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year another of the same quality arrived.
&quot;We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we have sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the franchise of Pytloun hotels have come forward&quot;, the number 1 of entrepreneurs last year.
“And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel, the victory in the competition for the entrepreneur of the year served well, adds Pytloun with gratitude.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Libérec and its surroundings.
&quot;People recognized me in the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very pleasant,&quot; he recalls.
He recommends participation in this competition to anyone who is striving to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he still uses his contacts and knowledge that he could not have obtained any other way.
&quot;With those I met through the competition I began to maintain regular business relations.
According to him, the fame linked to success had an impact on the employees as well.
And he&#39;s got about 70.
&quot;I see in them above all the loyalty and the pride of having committed themselves to something that has been generally recognized&quot;.
&quot;It is by far not the only result of my personal work, but the result of good work by all of us together.
&quot;Only my name is pushed forward&quot;, says Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the winner&#39;s sense of purpose Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to collect the prize from Slovansky dum for first place in the Firm of the Year competition organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the Farmet company.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which he transformed a tool shop in Ceska Skalice into a company with a turnover of 100 million crowns.
&#39;I can say that the award has not only encouraged me, my co-workers, and increased our self-confidence to fight the competition,&#39; says the winner of last year&#39;s competition today.
At the beginning of the Farmet company history there was the desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered to the father of Karel Zdrasky to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of the property by the communists, he did not hesitate for long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with some comrades in the entourage of his father for the manufacture of plastic bathtubs.
Not long after they started specializing in vegetable oil presses.
It has become after eighteen years the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company became known even to the non-specialized public after the success achieved in the competition through the media.
&quot;Not only did our customers start to really get to know the Farmet brand better, but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were collaborating with a company that had the greatest success in their home country&quot;, says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year did not pass at Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The valuation of the company had been made based on the economic results of 2008 and partly of 2009.
And precisely in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machinery.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their purchases of new equipment and technologies.
&quot;We obviously did not escape this situation&quot;.
“Turnovers fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even lay off workers,” explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures have to be taken.
But they handled the situation correctly and kept profitable results even if they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However at Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
&quot;We have built with the endowments a training and research center, have strengthened the presentation of the company in international fairs-exhibitions and won the main awards at national exhibitions&quot;, says Zdarsky.
Everything leads us to think that the crisis is behind them.
Business figures are going up and with them the number of employees as well.
&quot;To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere&quot;, says Karel Zdarsky.
The survey that removes senseless regulations.
Investigating the Absurdity of the Year is for the fourth time part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations have been removed.
The inglorious winner of this year&#39;s Absurdity of the Year survey was the requirement to bring documents to offices that civil servants can obtain on-line.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the social affairs administration asked for a paper extract from the commercial register, whereas the civil servant can obtain it with two clicks of the mouse.
that changes thanks to the survey.
“The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require the commercial register extract for insurance payment checks,” said Jana Buranova, spokesperson for the Czech Social Insurance Administration ( CSSZ).
Bringing out all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs have to fulfill in the Czech Republic and removing the absurd ones is the meaning of this Absurdity of the Year contest.
This survey is again this year for the fourth time part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3000 voters showed up, it is at least 4000 this year who brought their vote.
And it is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations which only slow down the company, and this, more and more.
&quot;We are perhaps among the number of documents to be filled out for tax declarations in the first places in the world,&quot; says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the whole world the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of conditions for business, which is 8 places higher than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first set up in 2006 and continues every year under the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense each year from April to the end of September, the last deadline before the competition closes.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organizer of the competition chooses seven candidates for the “antiprix” and lets the public vote during the month of October on the site www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that receives the most votes is declared the winner.
Until the last survey last year, it is a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees which have lost their sense of existence.
The remarks are sent by the contractors but also the professional unions and the professors.
Among the &quot;finalists&quot; of the competition, therefore among the nominees, is for example the obligation that maintenance vehicles of motorways and expressways pay tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees, repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of the seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The proclamation of the contest, which always begins at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening in which personalities from political and public life regularly take part.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, President of the Czech Chamber of Commerce, witnessed the highlight of the competition.
&#39;Economic prosperity cannot work when the State puts a stump in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this my objective is to remove, each year, at least three dozen paragraphs which today only complicate the company &quot; , said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to suppress absurd decrees is not a dud.
In 2007, what people did not like was the obligation for entrepreneurs to declare three days before to the office for the sole proprietorship in the place where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This requirement was removed with the amendment of the Sole Proprietorship Act.
The second most popular obligation in 2007, which was to declare to the Labor Office a service trip for a foreign employee over 30 days, was abolished with the text of the law on the so-called green card.
And everything is ok until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their practice, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year - the requirement to have a fridge was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Ecological, humanitarian, training or sports projects are evaluated.
New to this year&#39;s Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has been running for 5 years already, is the category called Responsible Firm of the Year 2010.
The objective of this competition is reasonable and fair corporate support.
&quot;We want to support companies that monitor the impact of their business on the environment and carry out a socially responsible activity&quot;, indicates Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, the firm Vodaphone, which is the guarantor and promoter of this contest, as in the case of the contest for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this sub-category of the contest of the firm of the year 2010, organized by the firm Vodaphone, registered the companies which do not have success with only one long-term objective for the company.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article should be published.
Although the purpose of their business is different from each other, their support and forecasting activity can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
For one of the cases, it concerns people with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole of the Czech Republic is, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, which for 17 years has been the main contributor to the endowment fund that sponsors disabled children.
Another example of taking care of employees with health problems is the Old Paper Factory in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 per cent of them and which, for this reason, has obtained the title of the firm Responsible for Central Bohemian region and placed third in the region in the Firm of the Year competition organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it was MiRyz Soft, a financial company, which won for having introduced flexible working hours and even reduced them to 35 hours per week on average, without, proportionally, a reduction in salary.
The jury awarded it the title also because it buys primarily from Czech manufacturers, supports local activity in the immediate vicinity and is concerned about the environment.
&quot;We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business activity and administration have the least impact on the environment,&quot; says Miluse Ryznarova, the company&#39;s executive director.
the responsible IT company Enlogit of the Usti region also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up an ergonomic chair and keyboard for each laptop, encourages them to work from home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
&quot;We also support the foundation The Man in the Shadows which helps the local Roma community&quot;, says Ondrej Suchy the representative of the company.
At the very last rank, also for its activities, is a washing and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the pension insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
&quot;In our society we contribute to food, transport, skill development and recreation&quot;, says Joseph Strapac of the construction company bruntal Czasch, winner for the Moravia-Silesia region.
Were automatically registered in the Responsible company category, all the regional finalists for the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition, who had answered the questionnaires attached to the document for registration and had returned it to the organizer before August 15th.
The incorrectly completed or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
&quot;If the representatives of the competing firms did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the Responsible firm but were not disqualified from the &quot;main&quot; competition the Firm of the year of Vodaphone&quot;.
&quot;Independent entries are not possible as this is a sub-category of the main Firm of the Year competition&quot;, explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison&amp;Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police made arrests during a public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen, anti-corruption police have been making arrests in recent days.
Detectives handcuffed local entrepreneur and real estate trader Lubos. G.
The latter had endeavored to manipulate a public call for tenders for the settlement of a claim for restitution in such a way that the land offered was obtained by a specific candidate.
He was to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
&quot;At this time I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for insider trading in a public tender and competition.&quot; declared for the newspaper Pravo the chief of the Prosecutor&#39;s office of Plzen Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is prohibited to provide more explanations because the investigation is in hand.
The police released the 46-year-old entrepreneur after 24 hours.
To know how he could influence a public competition, one can only speculate given the so little official information.
To a question from Pravo, Land Fund spokeswoman Lubomira Cerna said that the police had actually made an arrest in Plzen at a separate workplace and this during the public competition.
&quot;It was a client and in no way an employee,&quot; she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has the real name &quot;Call to propose rights for the transfer of land according to the Land Law&quot; and is set up when several candidates who are beneficiaries of rights appear.
“These people are offering, as part of the appeal, a higher value of their restitution rights which must be settled before the value of the land is announced”.
&quot;According to the rights offered, a classification of buyers is put in place and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who offered the highest rights&quot;, explained the spokesperson for the Fund.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information concerning the people who had registered for the call and since he himself is also a beneficiary because having bought a large number of rights to restitutions, he had proposed candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And he probably cashed in by withdrawing.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts well above the standards at the FdT (Land Fund).
It figured in the case of the ex-head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for having edited land for which the decision to set up a construction had already been edited.
It was precisely Lubos G., for example, who had obtained land intended for the construction of public communications, specifically on the site where the access road to the industrial zone of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it risked jeopardizing the construction by blocking the land.
Households will pay an additional one hundred crowns monthly for housing.
Households will have to pay extra from January not only for all types of energy but also for water and sewerage, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
Families will therefore have to draw from their wallets up to a hundred crowns monthly more from January than they do now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas almost 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more. dear.
The increase in electricity should be around 100 crowns annually more for apartment households than at present.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices given the significant development to encourage the manufacture of renewable energies, in particular photovoltaic batteries.
The gas increases moderately but of course when people need it the most for heating and therefore have the greatest consumption.
We can therefore also count a hundred crowns more.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the larger municipalities that are planning the price increase.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 crowns more per month, families in Libérec will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague is preparing a 9 percent increase for water and sewerage in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rents do not change Praguers will pay an extra 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest in comparison to the whole country.
In North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewerage increases by 7.4 percent.
Rent prices will increase, for example, significantly in the 450,000 apartments for rent from January, ie at the end of the regulation.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns almost 2,500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided on an increase of up to 100 percent.
Those who disagree with the new rent increase will be taken to court by the company.
The regulated rents people pay in nearly 300,000 apartments could rise next year by 10 percent.
Czech children get drunk on rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts slowly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whiskey are stolen from parents.
These are the drinks that most often bring those who get drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in hospital for a recurrence are no exception.
This results from the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to admissions in children&#39;s departments of hospitals.
&quot;Beers or wines are out of fashion because it takes time to get drunk.&quot;
“The trend is really towards hard liquor,” said Pravo Ludek Pelikan, head of the children&#39;s department at Horovice hospital in central Bohemia.
&quot;When they manage to steal a daddy&#39;s bottle from the cupboard, it&#39;s sometimes whisky, but it&#39;s fernet and vodka that prevail.&quot;
&quot;Vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not smell it&quot;, explains the Head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesperson for the Motol hospital, also agrees with him.
&quot;In general, it&#39;s rum or fernet&quot;.
&quot;It is the fashionable alcohol today, especially in elementary schools&quot;.
“In some cases it was slivovice that they brought from home,” Jurinova added.
According to Department Head Pélikan, seeing drunken children between the ages of thirteen and fourteen on hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice last year, he was in Motol where he practiced for ten years precisely in pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren from the wider surroundings completely drunk.
&quot;A young girl was hospitalized like this four times
&quot;She began her career at twelve years old when she was brought in with 3.5 per thousand of alcohol in her blood plus a mixture with ecstasy&quot;, described the doctor in this particularly important case.
&quot;She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Center at a party&quot;.
&quot;What is interesting is that it did not appear strange to the mother that her daughter was absent for 48 hours,&quot; said the Director of the Department, astonished.
It is precisely the disinterestedness of the parents or their extraordinary tolerance in the face of the fact that their offspring are addicted to drink which are the main cause of the development of alcoholism in children.
According to specialists, however, we are not talking about dependency, in its strict sense, for children.
“Under the term alcoholic we mean a chronic alcohol dependence lasting several years with all the phenomena that result from it but which are not found in children”.
&quot;Among those who use alcohol repeatedly, it is more a question of a significantly unfavorable socio-family background&quot;, explained the Head of Department Pélikan.
According to spokeswoman Jurinova, about forty drunken children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with severe poisoning requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are taken home after emergency treatment by parents or by the police are not counted.
Besides the cases of children who sit down and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pélikan there are three seasonal waves to be reckoned with: Witches&#39; Day, New Year&#39;s Eve and the end of the school year. .
&quot;Either they drink out of spite after bad results or, on the contrary, they celebrate the start of the holidays&quot;.
“Of course I experienced on the day of the witches an admission of 7 drunken children at once”, underlined Pélikan.
The drunk child who spent the night in the hospital in detoxification under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned home and suffers the next day from a &quot;hangover&quot;.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated with an infusion of glucose and nutrients the body needs.
&quot;They are better off for that since they spend a great evening then a sweet awakening and nothing hurts them&quot;.
“They are only surprised at where they are,” adds Pélikan, knowing that from time to time it spoils the good mood of patients, at least with the bill to pay for their care.
Transport by ambulance and hospitalization on an intensive care bed can cost up to tens of thousands of crowns.
&quot;From time to time, I applied this as a means of education by counting to these children how much their drunkenness cost and that they could spend the whole summer in seasonal work to reimburse a single evening&quot;, added Pélikan.
However, according to him, the health insurance companies in their management in regression, which should recover from the parents the expenses related to the care, do not treat the cases of drunken children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L-159 planes of the five in all, against which the Ministry of Defense exchanged Casa C-295M transport planes, took off on Tuesday for Seville in Spain, where the Casa-EADS aircraft manufacturer is based.
This is the first time that devices of this type have become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
They have, however, been abroad as part of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seater versions of the L-159T1 which have been in service with the Czech army until now and which were airworthy.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seat versions of the L-159.
These are currently stationed at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the firm Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure of the planes from Vodochody is currently unknown.
&#39;The single-seat L-159 aircraft planned for the exchange were taken from long-stored aircraft without causing additional burdens or investments for the Ministry of Defence&#39;.
&quot;The L-159 T1 two-seaters were exchanged in the state&quot;, declared for Pravo Pejsek.
He added that the army will not be without two-seaters since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused L-159 single-seaters into two two-seaters.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, with the second scheduled for delivery later this year.
According to Pejsek EADS is committed to introducing the planes into the equipment of certain Alliance countries.
&quot;In the contract it is clearly indicated that the one taking the L-159 planes into account is EADS and that they will be used to train pilots from NATO member countries&quot;.
“It is therefore the business of whoever is considering to determine how to achieve this,” Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa plane and the purchase of three other planes for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defense did not issue a call for tenders and contacted EADS directly.
the direction of the defense then argued that the exchange ensures a future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army has bought 72 aircraft from Aéro Vodochody and is only using 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will likely have legal implications.
the European Commission has nevertheless lodged a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defense with the European Court of Justice because the planes should have been chosen within the framework of a call for tenders on a European scale and in no case by contacting directly a manufacturer.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last of which should arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
Index finger longer than ring finger is a sign of low cancer risk
Men whose index finger is longer than their ring finger are at a lower risk of getting prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
It may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
&quot;Our findings show that relative finger length serves as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, particularly for men before age 60,&quot; said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for cancer research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should get tested for prostate cancer, especially when combined with genetic risk or other aggravating factors like family health history, Eeles added.
During the period of 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Great Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had their right hand index finger shorter than their ring finger.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
In the case of those who had the index longer than the ring finger, however, the risk fell to 33 percent, for men under 60 the reduction in risk reached 87 percent.
The length ratio of the two cited fingers - formed during the prenatal period - in particular indicates different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the womb.
A less testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it is precisely testosterone that helps in the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is aware of this study but does not seem to him that the relationship between length fingers and cancer is &quot;fully proven&quot;.
The Czech Republic is covered in snow, the D1 and D5 highways are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow this Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks, there is mostly compact snow, the clearers have worked all night in many places.
The D5 highway is closed in the morning between the 89th and the 93rd kilometer in the direction of Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 highway in Brno in the direction of Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (UAMK) told the news
At the 91st kilometer a truck was damaged, at the 93rd two heavy goods vehicles collided, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
Problems are also on the D1 highway at the 185th kilometer in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there
Drivers should exit just after Brno at kilometer 190 or go via Brno and then enter at kilometer 182 at Kyvalka.
A line of cars of several kilometers has formed at this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, the thermometers show - 7 degrees Celsius.
Lines of cars are created for example in Prosek, Sterboholska street is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams are running late, for example on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o&#39;clock in the morning the Prague crisis staff must still meet.
The railways and the airport are also experiencing problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to cancel 7 rapids connections due to snow.
The lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travelers should check the current situation.
Ruzyne airport has been closed since 11:00 a.m. Wednesday night until 5:00 a.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already drivable but with extra vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impassable, on the road to Brno there are beginning to be squalls of snow in places and on the road to Blansko chains are mandatory to pass certain communication routes in higher places. .
The Vyskov region was among the most affected places.
Until now the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them it may be necessary to send snow plows and snow blowers.
We cannot currently estimate when they will be rollable.
On the road to Hodonin, caution is required in the White Carpathian region.
On the roads which are, with regard to the protection of nature, maintained only by the sprinkling of inert products, there is all the same a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warns CTK.
In the Czech Republic, between two to 10 centimeters of snow fell; it fell the most in northern Bohemia, often with up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snow cover is gradually disappearing in the Czech Republic.
The Americans have a new &quot;smart weapon&quot;
The US military has sent a new &quot;smart&quot; weapon to Afghanistan, known only by the code name XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and &quot;will change the game&quot; in their favor.
The new weapon is like a super accurate cannon
Its projectiles are guided by laser with an accuracy of a few meters.
The special 25mm caliber ammunition developed for this rifle and containing high explosive, actually works like small grenades.
Munitions can be programmed in such a way that they will explode on contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who is hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
He is also not protected from above and when a lethal rain of steel shards falls on him, it can put him out of action as well.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use &quot;smart&quot; technology.
“The soldier essentially uses it in such a way that he finds the target, shoots a laser beam at it which determines the distance, thus obtains a precise aiming point, according to which he corrects his sight and pulls the trigger.
&quot;Let&#39;s say you aimed at 543 yards&quot;.
&quot;When you pull the trigger, the weapon loads and fires at a distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 meters, said Audette.
400 offshore jobs
The Fujitsu group relocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer their workplace to Astro Park, which is currently located in the office building at Place Mareinbader in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the giant specializing in the manufacture and maintenance of computers claimed on Wednesday, next year in July the workplace of 400 men and women, located until now on the Marienbader square in the city of Bad Homburg , will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, the group should group together 100 other jobs still scattered so far in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive. In addition, the open-plan offices of Astro Park are better suited to the way employees work.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
Managing Director Bernd Wagner said: &quot;Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location for us with a remarkable infrastructure.&quot;
He says that the connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
The head of economic affairs for the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again a &quot;global player&quot; had been won over in this way.
It is an &quot;extraordinary profession of faith relating to the location&quot;.
Fujitsu suits the city and its location is an important boost for Niederrad.
The Mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu&#39;s decision.
The management informed the municipality of this intention very early on.
“It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company,” Mr. Korwisi said.
However, the friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer vis-a-vis the owner of the building of the Place Marienbader.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a question of preventing such an exceptional place from remaining unoccupied for a long time.
&quot;I hope the owner and lessor of the building will be cooperative.&quot;
Ten years ago, the building in Place de l&#39;Hôtel de Ville, hitherto used by the Fujitsu company and the neighboring &quot;small vertical&quot;, as well as the rest of the buildings in Place Marienbad, were part of the project controversial construction of the spa.
The result of a joint project by the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and the Town Hall. This aroused numerous criticisms, not only because of the impressive layout of the surfaces which formerly served partly as a car park, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment rating and advisory firm, Feri, the maker of computers for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, a computer maker at the time still associated with Siemens, moved in in buildings.
In 2006, the German group specialized in Frankfurt Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the real estate fund Morgan Stanley. A year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Group, headquartered in Tokyo, considers itself to be the third largest supplier of computer products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to companies and also provides essential services.
Its branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has many more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, moves from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad. Other affiliates on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, houses, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of the electronics and electrical engineering industry.
Expulsion from the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is having more and more difficulty.
Internet service provider Amazon has expelled the site specializing in revealing confidential documents from its servers.
This attitude may hide political pressures suffered after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
Wikileaks founder Mr. Assange is apparently staying in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is being attacked with increasing force.
The group of cyber-activists &quot;Wikileaks&quot; no longer has access to its server previously hosted in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is likely to be staying in Britain, according to newspaper reports.
&quot;Wikileaks excluded from Amazon server.&quot;
“Freedom of expression in the land of the free”, said Wednesday (local time) the cyber-activists behind the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Shortly before, the cyber-company, Amazon, had deleted the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the release of the secret diplomatic notes, the cyber activists resorted to Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to reach the greatest number of accesses to the documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: &quot;Great, our dollars are now being spent looking after people in Europe.&quot;
When free speech is a problem for Amazon, &quot;they should stop selling books.&quot;
CNN, citing Mr. Liebermann&#39;s office, reported that Amazon banned Wikileaks from using its servers after an investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman&#39;s aides.
The chairman of the Senate Committee for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against it, reported the British newspaper, &quot;The Guardian&quot;.
&quot;I wish Amazon had taken this action sooner given Wikileaks&#39; previous releases of classified information,&quot; the senator said.
At the same time, Mr. Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
&quot;Wikileaks acts in an illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous manner. In doing so, it endangers our national security and endangers the lives of people all over the world,&quot; according to a statement from the independent senators.
&quot;No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to disseminate the contents of the stolen documents.&quot;
Wikileaks founder Mr Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol&#39;s wanted list.
According to information released by the London newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot;, the 39-year-old Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has constantly called the proceedings brought against him by Sweden an intrigue orchestrated by his detractors.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats have been made against the site.
&quot;Calls have even been made for the murder of Julian Assange.&quot;
This is why Assange particularly fears for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson was obviously reacting to statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that those responsible for the revelations made by Wikileaks be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Prime Minister Stephen Harper&#39;s adviser said on television, obviously ironically, that Mr. Assange should &quot;be killed&quot; and that Mr. Obama could &quot;use a Drone&quot;.
Meanwhile, a controversy erupted between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for US President Barack Obama, called it &quot;ridiculous and absurd&quot; that Mr Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and revealed very recently, to engage in espionage activities.
&quot;I&#39;m not sure why we have to care about the opinion of an individual website owner,&quot; says Gibbs.
&quot;Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website.&quot;
The US government is now completely testing the protection of its databases.
According to a statement from the White House, Mr. Russell Travers, deputy director of the Counterterrorism Center, has been made responsible for combating the leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for implementing &quot;the necessary structural reforms&quot; made essential after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House is also keen to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the US government has announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if ever they are threatened by the Wikileaks revelations.
“We have made every effort to contact them,” State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
&quot;We are ready to protect them if necessary.&quot;
Ice University
At the &quot;Gelato University&quot; in Bologna, ice cream confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day introductory course organized for future glaciers was a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where does all the ice come from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The ice cream maker, that is to say in German the somewhat old-fashioned ice cream confectioner, makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making.
The ice cream maker removes the ice cream from the refrigerated display using a spatula, places it in the waffle and then begins to sell it.
To find out, one does not need to go to Anzola dell&#39;Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream cannot avoid &quot;Gelato-University&quot; from the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of the ice cream makers founded the ice cream university in 2003 so that the ice cream produced by its machines meets high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day introductory course organized for future glaciers was a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice cream are also offered and extend over several days. Similarly, practical sessions are organized in the private ice cream shop.
In the midst of a midlife crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply venture to fulfill their burning desire on smooth ice.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia via Hungary.
Jacky, an art education teacher from California, is keen on the Slow Food movement. In the future, he wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke from Berlin is a business management consultant and after a few years she wants to get something special out of this nerve-wracking job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housekeeper came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Master ice cream maker Luciano Ferrari first explains to participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice cream.
Not only the good flavor is decisive, but also the silky softness and the right consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during training the icing on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, of the south: &quot;Italian gelato is simply the best: and then it still retains a hell of a dose of romanticism.&quot;
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees using an electronic program, then cools immediately to four degrees.
He then opens a tap installed on the machine: a pasteurized basic white cream emerges, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately assailed with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can we give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano cautions against being misled by the spirit of the times.
Anyone who only speaks of ice cream &quot;made from natural ingredients&quot; may have used stabilizers despite this: most often a natural product, for example guar seed flour obtained from the guar bean.
It is obviously possible to make ice cream without using stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will not bite anything but ice pellets.
Some modifications of the basic mass are permitted.
It becomes more exciting with the aromas.
The master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that one acquires in the fruit or confectionery section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powder and pastes.
&quot;Vendors will all try to pass you dozens of flavored ingredients.&quot;
&quot;However, you should just give it a try.&quot;
Either in fruit sorbet recipes with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs, becomes a yellow cream and constitutes, when cocoa powder is added, the base of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now all course participants must switch to using the ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other ingredients natural.
The different kinds of fruit ice cream are also subjected to the same experiment.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purees: From a taste point of view, this is not absolutely better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily have the taste of nuts, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
The hugely popular kiwi ice cream is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
&quot;Only a balanced mixture properly enhances the taste of an ice cream,&quot; says Luciano.
Making ice cream is an exercise in calculation: if peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
Extra sugar is needed for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents a device with which he determines the sugar content of different types of fruit (winemakers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, tables make calculations easier.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires as much physical intervention as in the past.
It&#39;s not just the basic mace auto-making machine that helps.
There is also a device in which the available ice mixture is simultaneously beaten to make it creamy and brought back to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automations, slight breakdowns are not excluded.
Brazilian Gustavo smears head to toe in mashed fruit and splashes on his fellow students when control of the colossal mixing bowl slips away from him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that &quot;an incident like this is likely to happen in every lesson: it&#39;s only a matter of time.&quot;
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry experimenting with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has infiltrated the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the group of experts Testbiotech which is considered an independent institute for the evaluation of the consequences of biotechnology.
&quot;It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well informed,&quot; said Mr. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech, in Munich on Wednesday.
There are reports that the chairman of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts are under contract with the lobby group Ilsi.
The latter is financed by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr Kuiper was a key contributor to the development of EFSA&#39;s test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a situation of conflict of interest, according to the criticisms made by Mr .Then.
The prescriptions drawn up correspond textually, by paragraph, to the position taken by the pressure group Ilsi and thus bear the mark of the industry which, basically, would be controlled by the authorities based in Parma in Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech has reported a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking Efsa official recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta without conditions or without a transitional period. In doing so, She changed sides.
A short time ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the authority of the European Union in charge of control and the industrial lobby, which aroused the suspicions of both the German Federal Environment Agency and MEPs.
However, Efsa does not admit the existence of any conflict of interest.
One opinion states that all reliable data, including industry data, is used as long as it is of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of EFSA are not prohibited from making contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) based in the United States.
This organization sees itself as a neutral forum bringing together experts who belong, among other things, to science, industry and politics in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the pay of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disagree with the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any feeding trials in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
&quot;We want to know what are, for example, the implications of genetically modified maize in the field,&quot; says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only the isolated proteins and not the whole genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results to be obtained.
&quot;If you don&#39;t look for risks, then how can you find them?&quot; asks Mr. Then accusingly.
This is also the point of view of Ms. Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientist has been carrying out research in the field of genetics since 1994 and currently works at the Polytechnic University of Zurich.
In this region as well as in the United States, and now also in Europe, industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
This is why there are hardly any researchers who are not linked to companies.
In the opinion of the companies, the critical studies would not be published.
Ms Hilbeck says &quot;industry controls safety research&quot;.
The trace of stone
Uli Gsell got some, in total about 400 kilos.
Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart station with her tube on her back.
There was a protest.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had come and started demolishing a large part of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Several thousand people demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart&#39;s main station into an underground station that will cost several billion.
Much of the wing was in ruins when protests led to a halt to construction work.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (shelly limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse cobblestone poorly constructed between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
He got hold of some fragments.
&quot;These stones are relics.&quot;
&quot;They must not disappear.&quot;
He enthusiastically declares: &quot;a modest and cheap rock, simple and earthly.&quot;
He claims that while cutting it with a saw, he smelled the smell of cigarette smoke.
He does not yet know what he will do with this fragment.
Rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
the traces of the Stuttgart stones lead to a former French army ammunition depot in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition that took place in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappeared in the landfill,” he says in his office located in a hut, which was once a guardhouse.
He says he was subjected to insults and threats when in September the newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for whole days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it does, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
About 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took away one of the stone parallelepipeds weighing an average of 80 kilos, the value of which is between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir in the hope of also returning it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full truck loads.
About half is still piled up in the forest, the rest long since sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, individuals.
They came from everywhere and took everything that could fit in the trunk and the trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long since turned into &quot;Mäuerle&quot; or limitations of grass beds.
&quot;By the way, this stone is nothing special,&quot; said Mr. Rongen.
&quot;were it not for this political component.&quot;
He gets into his all-terrain car, drives around his vast 20-hectare empire.
He studied law, which he abandoned. Later, he set out to study biology before later becoming interested in computers and eventually becoming a quarryman.
And a lover of stones.
It stores 40,000 tons.
He amassed his treasures all over Germany.
HE affirms that he is the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He restrains himself.
Artfully sculpted sandstones are laid on the snow.
&quot;They were once part of the Marienbrücke bridge in Dresden&quot;.
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he says enthusiastically.
&quot;My favorite stone.&quot;
He takes the path that climbs through the forest.
He points to a pile: Red sandstone, previously part of Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
&quot;Nice travertine.&quot;
The parallelepiped was once part of the stand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, the Cannstatt travertine from the police headquarters, the reddish granite from the Saint Blasien cathedral, the tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what efforts, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that stones were once carved by hand and moved with simple hoists and ox-drawn carts, he becomes quite reverent.
&quot;It would be a scandal if such a heritage were torn to pieces.&quot;
He did not become rich, much less extremely wealthy.
But this quarry now employs 14 people. In addition, stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener have settled in the forest.
&quot;We work hard, but it&#39;s rewarding,&quot; says the waste recycler.
Soon, he must go to Cologne.
There too, there are stones to be saved.
Talent struggle to conquer high potentials
The counter is very busy.
16 students scramble to buy salmon rolls, tomato sauce and blancmange.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and car manufacturer Volkswagen invited design and mechanical engineering students to a workshop.
As part of a kind of ideas competition, they have to talk about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, by the way, get to know the Volkswagen firm.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go hand to hand in the competition to unearth the best brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most gifted graduates as much as possible in the lecture halls before the latter arrive on the job market and are courted by the others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we try to identify exceptional talents within the framework of practical projects and to retain them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the automotive group coaxes talent.
A young lady from the personnel department shares pens, sweets and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the calendar of professional internships and student jobs for young talents; she shows them the paths to access the group compound.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are reciprocal advantages for both parties: &quot;Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience.&quot;
&quot;As for the Volkswagen Group, it can get to know the students, take a closer look at the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into play as a collaborator.&quot;
According to Mr. saddle, Such cooperation is unusual.
What is new is the offensive with which we seek to attract students.
“In the past, the emphasis was more on the professional project,” says Mr. Selle.
The fight for the conquest of new graduates will become much more bitter.
In many sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting through a myriad of candidates.
But they must praise their reliability and above all court the highly qualified workforce.
It is above all graduates from engineering courses who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant in October.
And according to the forecasts of the VDI, the vacuum relating to the posts of engineer will increase still further.
Roman Dykta is hunting for talent on behalf of KPMG, an audit, accounting and consulting firm.
It organizes expensive events aimed at recruiting talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of paper rally where competitors have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel the United States in this way.
Participants can also visit KPMG subsidiaries and get to know the company.
Who is to participate is decided in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the crème de la crème of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used for the quest for high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
&quot;We want to stand out from the crowd thanks to cruise racing.&quot;
&quot;For us, a simple cruise was too little&quot;
For the talent hunter that is Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
&quot;Until today, we have kept in touch with all the people who took part in a similar action last year.&quot;
&quot;Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to send their inquiries to our company soon.&quot; he says.
Apart from the direct cajoling carried out on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises proceed in a completely traditional manner by participating in professional fairs where they engage in the hunt for brains.
&quot;We try to reach graduates by attending trade shows.&quot;
“For example, at the solar technology fair,” says Ms. Sitha Stübe, human resources director at Solarworld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This Bonn-based company employs approximately 1,500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe is aware of the issue of succession.
Currently, 35 vacancies are advertised on the company&#39;s website.
&quot;Right now it&#39;s very difficult to fill vacancies.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s expensive and time-consuming,&quot; he says.
Another way to make contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
&quot;The professors indicate that the student has the possibility of carrying out professional internships or writing his end-of-study project with us.&quot;
Expensive advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise itself by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
“Often a large group cannot do this,” says Ms. Stübe, personnel manager.
Money has long ceased to play the main role in job hunting.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute constitutes an annual honor roll of German employers.
To this end, it asks employees about their level of satisfaction with their work and its context while looking at the framework conditions of employees.
Personnel manager Ms. Stübe hopes that this placement will help to enhance the company&#39;s image among job seekers.
“I think candidates mostly rely on external assessments when it comes to a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means above all taking internal measures.
“The best way for an employer to make itself attractive is to go through its own employees,” he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, ie the creation of the image of the employer within its own workforce.
&quot;Satisfied employees make the best messengers.&quot;
When you treat your employees well and they identify with the company, they alone advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
&quot;It&#39;s like playing in an orchestra,&quot; says Kriegler.
Obama puts a stop to new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, a state in the southeastern United States, for years to come.
The Washington government issued a ban An equivalent ban and, thus, permanently canceled its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited for the time being.
Home Secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement on Wednesday.
It is the explosion, in April, of the drilling platform &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; which is at the origin of this strict ban. This must remain in force for at least the next five years.
Faced with this accident which cost the lives of eleven employees and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and from this sector of activity, had indicated that he was willing to authorize further drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents of this solution thus want to reduce the dependence of the United States vis-à-vis foreign countries for the supply of oil.
The question of who bears the responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the golf course has not, to date, been definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing multi-billion compensation claims, is at the center of the charges.
A commission of inquiry created by Obama must present its conclusions in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the drilling freeze imposed after the rig explosion.
Following this decision, various oil groups immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter control measures and stricter security instructions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another disaster.
The competent control authority, which has discredited itself after numerous accusations of corruption, is currently undergoing in-depth reforms.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced the would eliminate the lucrative tax loopholes of gas and oil groups.
Industry players are now publicly warning that the inflow into the gulf would be significantly lower than it has been hitherto.
&quot;The government&#39;s objective is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector&quot; according to the result of a current survey carried out in the sector by the audit firm BDO, before the ban on drilling pronounced Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: &quot;Nobody knows what will change exactly with the regulations.&quot;
Investments in new support projects have been postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoni country is dry
Water flowing in rivers is oily brown; it gives off a smell similar to that which exists in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of liters of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live on theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
&quot;Don&#39;t run out,&quot; the environmental activist told reporters to calm them down: &quot;Today you still have enough oil mud in front of the duckweed.&quot;
The 37-year-old Nigerian attempted to photograph a youngster who was chest-deep in muddy water, as well as the greasy streak surrounding him: This scene looks almost beautiful in the burst of water the color of the &#39;Rainbow.
You can&#39;t see that the basement is full of brown slicks of crude oil.
On the bank of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom says that she once collected bucketfuls of shrimp here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil gushed out of a pipeline that had exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen living in the small neighboring town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach fish-filled waters: The Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The full extent of the devastation is obvious when walking through the mangrove swamps crossed by waterways.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat slices through crappy brown water. Anyone who sticks their hand in it pulls it out all covered in oil.
The small roots of the mangrove emerge from the ground like licorice sticks. The isolated palm trees sadly let their palms hang down.
We look in vain for flocks of birds, as we usually encounter in wetlands: As soon as the outboard motor stops, a ghostly silence falls on this paradise of yesteryear that looks like a resort. -service by the smell it gives off.
&quot;What is happening here is a war against the environment&quot;, declares Mr. Celestine Akpobari with a sad air: &quot;Our life is characterized by a permanent danger as far as health is concerned.&quot;
The comparison of wars is done.
The region where the Ogoni live has been a beleaguered battlefield for decades: Over 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. this was executed later. In 1993, the Shell group had to interrupt its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the return to the Ogoni country is forbidden to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 drilling wells and 7000 kilometers of pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are unexploited, because the situation there is too unstable for this oil group.
Every few hundred meters steel trestles rise up in the water like bizarre sculptures: The heads of boreholes are very affectionately called &quot;Christmas trees&quot;.
They are up to 50 years old, most are corroded to the mark.
Akpobari believes that a drill head of this nature occasionally breaks into pieces as a constant stream of crude oil flows through the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion liters have poured into the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that which flowed into the sea during the accident of the supertanker &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Who should bear the responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell group, the sabotage and siphoning of oil pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution. Environmentalists, on the other hand, consider drill-head explosions and punctured oil pipelines to be the main causes.
In 2008, the American researcher Richard Steiner criticized the Shell group for applying safety standards in Nigeria that are essentially less strict than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of pipe failures is &quot;even much higher than elsewhere&quot;.
Some forms emerge from the mangroves in a place that, seen from a distance, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of grease and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with grease up to their necks.
A fire flickers under one of the many barrels which sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered aimlessly on the site must be spotted: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours, explains team leader Michael.
At first, gasoline enters a container through pipes, then, at the end of the pipe, drops of kerosene fall and finally diesel is obtained.
This is how Michael and his four co-workers produce four 300 liter drums of Diesel daily: “It brings us 34,000 Naira”, about 22 dollars.
The people of the Delta are taking advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil-producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a lower price than the ridiculously low price of just 40 Euro cents per liter of Diesel: Because they acquire their raw material for free.
this is offered by the &quot;protectors&quot; who pierce the network of oil pipelines everywhere through the country of the Ogoni. According to experts, the country loses in this way at least 16 million liters of crude oil in the entire Niger Delta.
Only a small and insignificant part of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally purified: Organized crime networks, which also include politicians and high-ranking military members, load the lion&#39;s share into tankers and sell it off on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate over whether to attribute the environmental catastrophe or rather the subversive activities to the population or the lax mode of production as purely academic.
&quot;If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of the lives of fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no theft and illegal refineries.&quot;
But, in the meantime, the relations of the Ogoni, especially vis-à-vis Shell, had deteriorated so much that there was no longer any question of withdrawal from the group. &quot;maybe operators with other nationalities, such as Chinese, will prove better.&quot;
So, Michael gets nervous.
&quot;It&#39;s high time you cleared out,&quot; announces the robust oil worker.
&quot;Soldiers can spawn at any time.&quot;
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribes.
Even the soldiers, especially from the north of the country, intend to take advantage of the raw material like all Nigerians.
&quot;In every way, this damn thing has brought our country down to earth,&quot; Akpori said.
Investigators find construction flaws in A380 engines
The A380 obviously suffers from a major safety problem.
While examining an aircraft that made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction flaw that could lead to &quot;catastrophic reactor failure.&quot;
The airline Qantas now wants to file a complaint against the manufacturer of the reactor.
At the beginning of November, the passengers of the Airbus belonging to the company Quantas had obviously had more luck up to now: During the investigation which it carried out, the Australian authority in charge of aviation safety noted that the reactors of some A380 aircraft presented a serious safety problem, and it warns of a possible manufacturing defect.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leaks at the connection of the oil pipe, it is indicated in a position paper published this Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have led to a &quot;catastrophic failure of the reactors&quot;.
The engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce and fitted to 20 aircraft of the A380 series are concerned.
The Quantas Airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4, is one of them.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the English engine manufacturer.
She filed a legal complaint in an Australian federal court headquartered in Sydney. This gives him the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas director Alan Joyce said his company would seek damages in connection with the incident that occurred in early November.
Parts broke off and the airfoil was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it was the oil ignition that caused the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors now need to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that other safety-related tests will be carried out on the superjumbos which are also equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety issue is considered significant enough to notify all affected parties.
After the emergency landing of its plane, the airline company Quantas grounded its entire fleet of A380s for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily grounded three of its eleven A380s.
The company Lufthansa replaced, as a precautionary measure, the engine of an A380.
The double-decker aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
The snowfall throughout the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany all covered in white: In one night, snow fell over almost the entire country.
Chaos reigns on all the roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Germany is shivering in winter: In freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic was covered in snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimeters in places.
Traffic is heavily restricted on several highways and on many roads.
On the A7 in Flensburg, the winter service personnel worked permanently, but they could not cope with the snow which continued to accumulate.
In addition, strong gusts swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects tidal waves to occur on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels of up to 1.2 m at the above normal.
Snow piles on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the bad weather warning center Meteomedia has announced the purple warning level has been announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, this is the highest level.
In places, 30 centimeters of fresh snow fell, which the strong, cool winds dispersed.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there overnight.
Even in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities announced serious disturbances on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind led to a traffic interruption and caused traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall affected the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious disruptions to rail traffic have occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, fallen trees on the railway tracks, destroyed catenaries or needles.
In Saxony, interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers on the train with blankets, food and drink.
Snow winds swept the roads.
The snowfall led to numerous flight cancellations at major airports in Germany.
According to a spokesperson for Standard and Flight Information, a few cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A Fraport spokesperson says 40 flights have already been canceled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service provides permanent service there.
It is true that passengers stuck at the airport are no longer numerous, despite this barely 400 beds are available to them.
Accidents occurred Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the layers of snow on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: Even here, a truck was hit at a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car rolled over on slippery pavement in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce good news: The snow will certainly always be soft and powdery, but it will swirl in the event of light gusts.
But, the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by strong and fast winds.
However, it is very cold, down to minus 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
The Deutsche Bank seeks to part with its emblem: According to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could bring in up to 500 million Euros.
The Deutsche Bank has just embellished the headquarters of the group: The twin towers located in the Business District have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers had to return to their former place of duty.
From now on, the financial group is clearly seeking to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper “Financial Times Deutschland” writes, citing a spokesperson.
This spokesperson did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said &quot;we are checking whether it is more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or to sell them, and to put them up for rent again later&quot;.
This is how Germany&#39;s largest financial institution already gave up its headquarters shortly afterwards.
It was only in the middle of 2007 that the bank had acquired the twin towers for an amount of 272 million Euros from equity holders. She then rehabilitated them.
The transformations aimed at energy optimization have swallowed up, according to certain indications, around 200 million euros.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector of activity estimate the value of the towers, renamed in the meantime &quot;Green Towers&quot;, at around 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesperson, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund belonging to the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the miners who perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people spared a thought for the buried miners who were pronounced dead following several explosions at a mine.
We had not yet been able to bring up the bodies because the security situation of the damaged well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors aged between 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been inserted into the stricken well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and the subsequent explosions, no rescue team was able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that the miners had no chance of surviving.
So far the bodies could not be reassembled.
Today, relatives and friends organized a party in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a bright sun in Greymouth in the south of the New Zealand island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 buried miners, we installed 29 tables on which we could see the names, helmets and lamps.
Photos and personal effects, including clothes and surfboards, also had their place.
The flags were lowered in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told attendees of the memorial party that New Zealand had hoped the miners would come to the surface.
&quot;But they never came home.&quot;
Mr Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in the pits says he cannot come to terms with his son&#39;s death until he sees his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Miners of South African and British origin were also buried in the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescue workers have begun to put out a fire inside New Zealand&#39;s South Island coal mine.
Police Commissioner Gary Knowles told reporters that when masses of explosive gas are moved, the scorching temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the film Splatter an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the ancient genre with his film, &quot;Walhalla Rising&quot;, a fighter&#39;s epic.
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have in mind when shooting &quot;Walhalla Rising&quot;?
A one-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his executioner and, with almost supernatural strength, eliminates his adversaries one after the other. This seems ideal for young male viewers looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal methods of assassination. When he is in a bad mood, he tears out the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to be dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the movie, the one-eyed man doesn&#39;t say a word about his real name. Even the other characters let out, at most, at the turn of a sentence or two, a few horrifying cries of agony.
Otherwise, we say nothing and feast in the impossibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland which formed the backdrop to the world of the Vikings some thousand years ago.
This would be ideal for more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent tracking shots.
When a film aims at several target groups, it is unfortunate that these are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been considered, since the release of &#39;Pusher,&#39; his fierce and stylish drug smuggler trilogy, a sort of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more humor to the mainstream. dominant or introduce a little less brutality to arthouse cinema.
Most art cinema sympathizers must be horrified by the brain spreading all around and the intestines.
Action-movie fans die of boredom when the one-eyed man embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity in the stillness and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to be silent.
It&#39;s no wonder then that &quot;Walhalla Rising&quot; found no film distributors in Germany and only exists in DVD format.
It&#39;s mostly because of the gorgeous images of misery that have earned some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, every once in a while, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It&#39;s not about dialogue in this film, nor about coherent action, it&#39;s all about atmosphere, a fever dream transformed into a film.
The viewer cannot escape it.
Refn barely grants her a moment of relaxation and slowly slits her throat with chilling imagery and a mournful soundtrack, but mostly with an elusive hatred that wells up from the characters&#39; hearts.
Only a blond young boy, who faithfully stands beside the one-eyed man, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
More than anything, the one-eyed hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any moment to fight enemies and tentative allies by transforming into a warrior, may be an envoy of the devil himself. .
It represents rotting, but perhaps also, just for those who are rotten anyway.
&quot;Walhalla Rising&quot; is an enigmatic film that we can hate or admire, which aims to annoy, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications concerning a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, even less to submit to the agency&#39;s controls.
On the night of September 5-6, 2007, around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the largest city located nearby is 30 kilometers away: it is Dair as-Sur.
His name appears in the IAEA documents, because it is about the reactor that Syria built it seems with the help of North Korea in a parallelepiped of stone, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of current electric.
According to a briefing from the United States intelligence services, the CIA, dated at the end of April 2008, the current reactor, known by the name of the nearby locality, el-Kibar, would be well suited to produce plutonium, which would make it possible to manufacture atomic weapons.
However, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a teaser video featuring blurry satellite images.
Through the computer-aided animation, she indicated the probable location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the plant which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, even the interior of it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be commissioned, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombardment, we have barely more information than at the time, and even, with time, the mystery thickens more and more.
Former President of the United States George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before this attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor at el-Kibar, but had few clues showing this. country was developing &quot;an active nuclear weapons program&quot;.
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a &quot;presumed reactor&quot;, even if they consider the CIA&#39;s presentation &quot;plausible&quot;.
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how he makes sure he&#39;s dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior United Nations diplomat gave only a terse answer in the summer, saying the IAEA had &quot;sufficient documents to To ask questions&quot;.
The Syrians certainly hurriedly removed the rubble of the &quot;unused military building&quot; and methodically leveled the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former chief inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of man-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received from a Member State satellite images from commercial providers showing the moment immediately following the attack. it seems that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, possibly Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always ensured that it had never carried out a secret atomic program and that it had not built a reactor.
Damascus maintains that the uranium found at the site comes from the weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after the analysis of the particles, calling it implausible.
Since that time, Damascus refuses any discussion on this subject, just like on the subject of satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow the controllers to carry out a second inspection on the site of el-Kibar and refuses access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel maintains a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently declared: &quot;We will never comment on this&quot;.
This is how the investigation into this affair has been dragging on since June 2008 without reaching a result and that it &quot;is turning more and more into a serious problem of credibility for the Agency&quot;, as recognizes a high-ranking Western diplomat in service at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna, ultimately it is a serious violation of the treaty for the prohibition of nuclear weapons.
The IAEA considers that to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the three other installations which must have &quot;a functional relationship&quot; with the alleged reactor.
So far, inspectors have not indicated which facilities are involved here, nor what their function is or what they are suspected of containing.
According to information published by the newspaper &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot;, they are known within the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also from the name of the neighboring towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington has identified these localities and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf which is most likely one of the suspect objects.
It is possible that it is in a military base or directly next to it; this is exactly the reason why Syria refuses access to the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians fear that the inspection group are in fact spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA in order to spy on military installations.
In fact, it was information provided by American secret agents that caught the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles shuttled between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped in order to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could &quot;be used for the production of the fuel&quot;.
It would have &quot;no indications concerning sensitive activities&quot;, such as the enrichment and the reprocessing of uranium; processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are, if need be, plausible hypotheses concerning the following fundamental questions: where should the uranium have come from and where would the plutonium necessary for the manufacture of the bomb have subsequently been separated?
It is not known whether the rubble, which could hide traces of great value, was stored in the three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks loaded with earth are gone, no one will have information about where the rubble is stored.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometers from el-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, examined in 1998 for see if it can be suitable for storing radioactive waste.
By recently analyzing photos taken by satellite on behalf of the famous magazine Jane&#39;s Intelligence Review, the former inspector of the IAEA, Mr. Robert Kelley established a link between them and the reactor in question.
Satellite photos, however, show that Syria undertook earthworks at the three suspected sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to these locations.
It&#39;s possible that it was a coincidence, but it didn&#39;t help dispel the suspicions.
In fact, it is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for the inspections to be carried out there. This plan was to allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only the time invested shows what great interest the inspectors have in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus also shrugged off this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported for this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the US ambassador who has been talking for a few months about what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means available to the Atomic Agency to implement its controls.
The director of the IAEA, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has certainly already spoken of &quot;an option to which I am open in the future&quot;, but he still hesitates.
This means involves an enormous risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the Board of Governors of the IAEA and a good number of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation escalate.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who gives food for thought: &quot;Would it be good, if in the end they find nothing&quot;
Love in Wartime
It&#39;s been bad since Angelina Jolie made her summer directorial debut.
She wrote the script herself: it&#39;s a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Nothing more is known about this story, but it is enough to cause unease.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian tormentor during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women&#39;s federations immediately protested. In response, some filming sequences planned in Sarajevo were moved at the last minute to Hungary.
In the meantime, the film is being shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase protests are still continuing in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war sent correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet the &#39;actress. Jolie is herself a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.
She is not a diplomat. A few weeks ago, she proposed to these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
&quot;The meeting must be held in Bosnia,&quot; said Hasecic.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie&#39;s script says enough about her attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic&#39;s organization subsequently recommended that the United Nations High Commission remove Angelina Jolie as Goodwill Ambassador.
But, by the way, what sort of script did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of his script, granted after some hesitation a filming permit in Sarajevo, but it is not known why it did not then come despite this authorization.
The young author assures herself that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that it is by making a lot of efforts that she became aware of the Yugoslav conflict. She maintains that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of war and give the opportunity to all stakeholders to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It&#39;s quite different: The lovers knew each other long before the war started. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
Which is still a big difference with the version &quot;a rape victim falls in love with her executioner&quot;.
That Jolie&#39;s film began long before the war, of course.
The pressure exerted on her, as Jolie puts it, is &quot;unfair and based on erroneous information&quot;.
From now on, only the fanatics of Hollywood can bring him peace: By putting this scenario illegally in the Net, like many others before.
Let&#39;s shoot!
Tonight, all is well again with the Irish.
no trace of dismay.
This is why the home team excessively dominates the visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans scream with joy against a background of loud music, they stamp their feet.
Baileyu-Pub in Cork, Southern Ireland vibrates as players throw and successfully knock table tennis balls from a distance of three meters into the opposing team&#39;s beer cups.
This bizarre spectacle is called &quot;beer pong&quot;. The winner pockets 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to attend the beer pong world championship in January in Las Vegas.
Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really do not go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the boring question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas does not figure in his plans. In January, he will conduct job interviews in New Zealand.
&quot;However, I have a strange feeling,&quot; he says.
&quot;Homeland is so far away and I don&#39;t have a job there.&quot;
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, &quot;in less than two, she landed her desired job as an event project manager, maybe a good sign&quot; says the young man smiling.
Due to the bleak outlook at home, two of Tanner&#39;s three sisters tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, his brother Colin now works as an IT consultant in London.
Young people go: The situation of most families living on the island resembles that of the tanners.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even foresee a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts come true, it will be a wave of emigration comparable to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish have enjoyed great ease, grief now takes over.
However, the economic crisis is particularly affecting young, well-educated Irish people, who have so far only known moments of happiness.
Job loss and social degradation seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone had a job, there is excess money.
But, in the meantime, three out of ten people under the age of thirty are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper publishes many letters to the readers written by young emigrants, who complain: &quot;In Ireland, everything is adrift.&quot;
&quot;There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever has the opportunity leaves and so does our country for a whole generation.&quot;
&quot;The last to leave turns off the light.&quot;
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students&#39; Union, sees a bleaker future because the government is just window dressing and offering young people no prospects.
&quot;They are cutting minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,&quot; said the 20-year-old student.
She sees how her comrades cling from one unpaid internship to another.
She says her biggest worry is to emigrate herself in four years.
&quot;It&#39;s a sad and depressing thought.&quot;
However men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this theme positively.
McLarnon organizes the &quot;WorkingAbroadExpo&quot; exhibition which offers full support on the subject of &quot;working abroad&quot;.
&quot;But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for newcomers to the profession to take the first steps up the ladder of the professional hierarchy,&quot; says the manager.
His website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a hassle, but it also guarantees freedom and fun.
For six months, Seán O&#39;Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing left for the 29-year-old engineer to do in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction industry in Germany.
A fashion house is just emerging from the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other projects Hannover or Berlin.
In the meantime, O&#39;Donovan only rarely visits his native country, because he takes part in an additional job, in order to be able to finish repaying the loan taken out to build his house in his native country.
“The situation is already a bit crazy,” he says, crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
&quot;I am earning money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I hardly live anymore.&quot;
He bursts into an embarrassed laugh as he crosses the cold rooms.
The small house is in a residential area with manicured front gardens, expensive brand name cars are parked on the driveways.
Four years ago, O&#39;Donovan bought the house together with his sister for 380,000 Euros, financed 100 percent by credit.
&quot;Those were crazy times, no doubt the money was easy,&quot; he says.
Is he afraid of seeing everything crumble because of credit?
O&#39;Donovan thinks for a moment, pours more hot tea, and says, &quot;I have no children to support and I am young; even everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch.&quot;
The building engineer doesn&#39;t like the lamentations he often hears lately.
&quot;No one should go hungry, our situation is still not as dramatic as what we once experienced here on the island,&quot; he says.
&quot;Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe that&#39;s what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
&quot;He was back after seven years there and life in Ireland just went on.&quot;
This idea pleases Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and discover how life is elsewhere.
In his track record, he already has a few years of work in London. That&#39;s why life must not be so easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is one more thing that has been worrying him a lot these last few days: the party to be organized on the occasion of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He fears that it could turn into a farewell party.
&quot;Only, not a lot of emotions,&quot; he said, taking a long sip of beer.
&quot;A farewell, it still seems worrying.&quot;
&quot;Let&#39;s call it a goodbye party, all relaxed, with a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games.&quot;
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a bigger concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro survey taken from 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
As the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it tracks changes in attitude in the region.
Two related things emerge from the results of this year&#39;s survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is Latin America&#39;s fairly sunny mood.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the Pacific Rim of South America (see Table 1).
For example in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a low of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also rose in Mexico, where the economy has rebounded after suffering a sharp drop in output last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are staunch Democrats, pushing down the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region said they were satisfied with the way their country&#39;s democracy worked in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a strong increase on the 25% in 2001 (graph 3)
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country&#39;s parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but up sharply compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
A decade ago, economic problems in Latin America shook support for democracy.
If this held up during the global financial crisis, it is certainly because many of the countries of America suffered only a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a social safety net helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty rose only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year, to 32%.)
But the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see graph 4).
Brazil&#39;s strong economic performance and the popularity of its incumbent president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and violent crime has increased.
It was only the second time since the poll began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important issue for their country (see Table 5 ).
About 31% say they or someone close to them has been the victim of a crime in the past year; nevertheless, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
Stronger economic performance is reflected in rising support for private enterprise and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, up from 56% in 2007 ( see graph 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela feel this way (and 80% support private enterprise); even if their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the biggest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (up from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% from last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A sullied vote
No one expected to have a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the stricken and fearful country.
We presented ballot boxes and a new ballot, ballots scattered in the gutters, ransacked polling stations and intimidation
Polling stations opened late at night.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced by the January earthquake, wandered the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them ended up giving up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several presumed frontrunners, denounced the fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior United Nations official in Haiti, considers the event &quot;a pretty good election in many ways.&quot;
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously that they &quot;did not believe that these irregularities, however serious, had necessarily invalidated the process&quot;.
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared void.
But there may be problems if Mr. Celestin, who has little or no discernible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority to have reached the second round or reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, it was feared the turnout would be.
As it happens, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so due to the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, necessary to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in rebuilding Haiti.
And so, it&#39;s clear, the Haitians are doing it themselves.
tiptoe to the center
Weeks after being suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, President of Argentina, enjoyed a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rating by 20 points, to more than 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could hinge on whether the visibly grieving Ms Fernández chooses whether or not to abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, on this subject, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had a history of crafting budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the extra income at will.
Ms. Fernández&#39;s government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation descended into disarray following the death of Mr Kirchner from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement rallied behind Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian punched one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
&quot;I&#39;m not going to argue,&quot; the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president even greater leeway to spend at will.
The economy is largely overheating: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and union wage demands see the figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, has made growth and poverty reduction a priority, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, he harassed the private sector and purged INDEC, the statistical office, which falsified official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been boosted by high world prices for Argentina&#39;s agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded the boost to growth following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
This may be why Ms. Fernández shows signs of wanting to restore Argentina&#39;s financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year, the government struck a deal with bondholders who had refused an earlier forced debt restructuring that Argentina failed to meet in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve surveillance by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the economy minister, announced that the Fund would provide &quot;technical assistance&quot; to design a new national consumer price index; which looks like a prelude to the cleanup of INDEC.
It is unclear whether Ms Fernández wants to stay in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer by her side.
If she does, she needs to gain support from the middle class, among whom Kirchnerism is highly advocated.
By the time the Argentinians return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have ebbed.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to quietly repudiate many of her husband&#39;s policies.
Half a hurray for China
Taiwanese voters are moving toward some sort of closer union with the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters turned out on Nov. 27, or 70 percent of those eligible, to elect mayors and councilors in five city districts, in what is seen as a broad assessment by the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma has himself become a surrogate for feelings on the mainland, having forged ground-breaking business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the biggest revamp of relations with China proper since 1949. .
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just barely.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party won three of the five mayoralties, he failed to win a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which leaned toward full independence for Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all votes for the 45% KMT.
If this had been a presidential poll, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party&#39;s vote share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in the municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main subjects of Taiwan&#39;s elections, including rowdy campaign trucks and mass rally flags with dancing girls in minimal attire.
A mandatory mystery assassination attempt was also carried out.
Sean Lien, son of KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan, conducted an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, wounding him and killing a bystander.
Oddly, it has not been determined whether the shooter wanted to harm Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Either way, says Tsai Ing-wen, the DPP leader, the murder had consequences for the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest election winner was China.
It was striking how absent the mainland issue itself was.
Instead, candidates jousted with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threat from China.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its ties to the Beijing government.
But this time around, the DPP also refrained from stirring up anti-China sentiment.
It is the response to a new realization that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan&#39;s economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation on whether his China policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue providing trade facilities, in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan back home.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Certainly, she would also like to see political integration; but let&#39;s start at the beginning.
Better wait for that after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, it was in bad shape: its former boss, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur in favor of explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under Ms Tsai&#39;s leadership, and the PDP is doing everything it can to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been hailed as a DPP candidate for president, like Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that it too can engage with Beijing.
Ms Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, on the condition that their talks could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party presents a &quot;trustworthy alternative&quot; to Mr. Ma&#39;s hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement released from his cell, he said DPP candidates would have performed better had they insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen&#39;s intervention, the DPP will find it difficult to choose between its potential candidates.
The KMT needs to do some self-reflection.
Mr. Ma&#39;s ratings have been weak; despite dizzying economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says his cabinet as well as its local branches will be reshuffled.
The DPP&#39;s strong results suggest that Taiwan&#39;s support for the rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, &quot;the point of no return has already passed.&quot;
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise shortlisted in the &#39;best new artist&#39; category
Perform at the request of a president, and people are bound to take notice.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer hand-picked by President Obama to perform at his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, scored one of the surprises at this year&#39;s Grammy Awards with a high-profile nomination in the category of &quot;best new artist&quot;.
Considering Spalding has been a very well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album &#39;Esperanza&#39;, the nomination remains a bit of a mystery but is consistent with Grammy rules that an artist should not release more than three albums before recording; which &quot;establishes the public identity of this artist.&quot;
His ambitious 2010 album &quot;Chamber Music Society&quot; certainly marked a step forward, and given his mildly engaging vocal style, deft hand of pop and funk, and Latin influences, it&#39;s possible to draw at least one Dotted line to Spalding compared to the runaway success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters when considering jazz productions in that category in recent years.
Elsewhere, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio&#39;s &quot;Historicity&quot; in the &quot;instrumental album&quot; category, a jaunt on an invigorating thrill from a recording that was an overriding favorite last year.
Among these Iyers, &quot;Moody 4B&quot; by veteran saxophonist James Moody and &quot;Positootly&quot; by keyboardist John Beasley will notably be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a hoarse-voiced New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO&#39;s &quot;Treme,&quot; was honored in the contemporary jazz category; which also leans strongly towards a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Steampunk-acquainted savage Darcy James Argue&#39;s Secret Society earned some well-deserved accolades in the large ensemble category; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album &quot;Pathways&quot; of his octet&#39;s live was a fine example of this bass player&#39;s democratic hand as a group leader.
Grammy nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards feature a mix of landscapes from musicians and songwriters around the world.
Leading the nominations were Michael Daugherty&#39;s &#39;Deus Ex Machina&#39;, for piano and orchestra, with five &#39;yes&#39;; and &quot;Dreamhouse&quot; by Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three &quot;yes&quot;.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, &quot;Los Angeles&quot;, a work which was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and which opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman&#39;s Madolin Concerto is also up for an award.
Classical nominations are split across 13 categories covering orchestral, operatic, choral and solo recordings.
A category for Classical Producer of the Year features five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classical album are Bruckner&#39;s Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty&#39;s &quot;Deus Ex Machina&quot; and &quot;Metropolis Symphony&quot; from the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; &quot;Dreamhouse&quot; by Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; &quot;Sacrificium - the art of the Castrati&quot; featuring various artists; and Verdi&#39;s &quot;Requiem&quot; from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg&#39;s &quot;Lulu&quot; from the Royal Opera House Orchestra; Adolf Hasse&#39;s &quot;Marc Antonio e Cleopatra&quot; from Ars Lyrica Houston; &quot;Love from afar&quot; by Kaija Saariaho from the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; “The Enchanted Wanderer” by Rodion Shchedrin from the Mariinsky Theater Orchestra and Chorus; and &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; by Arthur Sullivan from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers who are up for Grammy Awards for Contemporary Composition include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for &quot;Deus Ex Machina&quot;, Hans Werner Henze for &quot;Appassionatamente Plus&quot;, Magnus Lindberg for &quot;Graffiti&quot; and Shchedrin for &quot; The Wanderer Enchanted&quot;.
Pärt&#39;s Symphony No. 4 had its premiere at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is nicknamed &quot;Los Angeles&quot; and is dedicated to the ex-oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman&#39;s &quot;Mandolin Concerto&quot; was nominated for its solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he wrote the 15-minute work especially for mandolin player Avi Avital, who performed the concerto with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
&quot;I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a lot of scales and rhythms from North Africa,&quot; Dorman said in a phone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of works by Stravinsky.
Instrumental soloists nominated include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only vocalist-soloist nominees; here they are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the Classical Mixes category, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording &quot;Roots: My Life, My Song&quot;
Temecula Mosque project wins planning commission approval.
A proposed mosque in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often impassioned public testimony.
Critics have attacked the project claiming that it promotes both terrorism and traffic jams.
But commissioners ruled late Wednesday that the new religious center complied with local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
&quot;A lot of good people came out to support him: Christians, Jews, Baha&#39;is, you name it,&quot; said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
&quot;I&#39;m proud of that, as an American citizen.&quot;
&quot;It shows that justice prevails.&quot;
&quot;The opposition is really minimal,&quot; he added.
&quot;They just have really loud voices.&quot;
&quot;We have good people in this valley.&quot;
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with people speaking out for or against the center most of the time, with speaking time roughly evenly distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper&#39;s website.
“There is no more America,” wrote one commenter.
&quot;This is another Planet of the Apes with Miss Liberty dead in the sand.&quot;
&quot;America has fallen.&quot;
Planned Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, site of the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush spoke out against violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of about 135 families co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years, but she wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse she rented on shared property with a building systems manufacturer. water filtration.
The new 24,943 square foot mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and stand 43 feet tall.
It would occupy a 4.32 hectare site on Nicolas Road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
An arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, widens the field for finding new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although the researchers discovered the unusual bacterium here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
&quot;This organism has a double capacity.&quot;
&quot;It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s why it&#39;s very special, even if it&#39;s far from a truly &#39;alien&#39; life form,&quot; commented Paul Davies CW of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in Thursday&#39;s online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But the researchers found that the bacteria, discovered in Mono Lake, California, is able to continue growing after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
&quot;One wonders what&#39;s still possible,&quot; said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important when it comes to the search for life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, Anbar says.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not release details of the find, generated widespread speculation on the internet that the report may leak the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It was not the case.
The discovery &quot;shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms might be able to use other elements to drive biochemistry and that the &#39;standard&#39; set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, may not be fixed,&quot; commented Charles Cockell, Professor at the Institute for Planetary and Space Science Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the search party.
&quot;This work is novel because it shows the substitution of one element for another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure,&quot; Cockell added.
It was no accidental discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, she speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances might be able to substitute one for the other.
&quot;Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus.&quot;
&quot;As a result, organisms have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately.&quot;
&quot;But arsenic is different enough that it doesn&#39;t work exactly like phosphorus; it gets inside and kind of erases the work of our biochemical machinery,&quot; Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows best on phosphorus but the fact that it can live on arsenic instead raises the possibility that an arsenic-using life form may occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing has ever shown that it could work.
Arsenic was more common early in Earth&#39;s existence, she says; thus, researchers have speculated that early life forms might have used it.
This suggests that there could be other ways life formed, not just the way life on Earth was formed in the beginning,&quot; said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe&#39;s research team. -Simon.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
Last two stolen show dogs found in Compton
The other two of four show dogs stolen from outside a motel in Bellflower have been found, Los Angeles County Sheriffs announced Thursday.
The four show dogs - two Akitas and two Welsh Pembroke Corgis - went missing on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van they had spent the night in outside a Bellflower Motel 6, the authorities said. authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late Wednesday evening, Los Angeles County Sheriff&#39;s Department spokesman Steve Whitmore told reporters.
&quot;The good news is that the dogs are doing well,&quot; says Whitmore.
&quot;They are in good shape.&quot;
&quot;They have been returned to their rightful owners.&quot;
Whitmore declined to say specifically where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood and under what circumstances they were found.
&quot;An investigation is underway.&quot;
&quot;We don&#39;t want to say it,&quot; Whitmore said.
&quot;We follow orders.&quot;
The dogs&#39; owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached for comment on Thursday.
They were reunited Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey.
Sheriff&#39;s deputies located the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were safe and sound, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional shows this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were missing until their discovery on Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend for the Long Beach &quot;AKC/Eukanuba&quot; National Championship, where they were planning to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events scheduled in the days leading up to the &quot;AKC/Eukanuba&quot; show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple&#39;s nearly month-long dog show tour.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, right next to their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany spaniel - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the thicker-furred corgis in the van where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a bit, so the dogs could get some fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van stolen at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, fitted with an implanted microchip to identify them.
It is unclear if an award was given on Thursday.
Lion ready to blush again, MGM restructuring awaits final green light from court
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York on Thursday formally praised the &quot;pre-packaged&quot; plan by creditors that about $5 billion in debt would be wiped out; paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and distributing movies and TV shows.
With Thursday&#39;s ruling that the plan meets the requirements of the US bankruptcy code, there are no legal hurdles left for MGM to get back on its feet under the tutelage of Entertainment Spyglass founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become general managers of what will be a lean studio.
Staff will be reduced to around 320 from 400 initially.
MGM will not truly emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase completes a $500 million credit facility, intended to fund MGM&#39;s new operations and productions.
It is currently being licensed by the investment bank, which is running into $75 million itself, and is expected to be funded around mid-December.
The studio&#39;s restructuring process began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis &amp; Co. was engaged to advise management on how to place its finances given that it could not afford to pay interest. amounting to 300 million dollars per year.
In August, chief executive Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron CEO and turnaround expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Donuts.
Moelis and Cooper&#39;s attempts to resolve MGM&#39;s financial difficulties and satisfy the studio&#39;s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the additional $2 billion that creditors were seeking.
In the spring of this year, it all had to be redone as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan which, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October. .
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the following weeks, the Moelis and Cooper companies receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis &amp; Co., which has already obtained $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper companies, which have raised $375,000 a month for their company leadership services, will receive a &quot;success bonus&quot; of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to revive production at MGM, which released only one film this year, and put together an annual slate of seven or eight films to be released starting in 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on &quot;the Hobbit&quot;, with Warner Bros.
The studio must take out a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to finance its part in these two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM&#39;s debt, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies did not lead to an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget in balance
Although the leading contender for this year&#39;s most wonderful toy is the iPad, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft&#39;s video game system Kinect, both can make a big dent in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five $99 BMX bikes, and a Kinect set costs the same as 10 classic bead jump ropes, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy vendors — Wal-Mart, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, and BJ&#39;s Wholesale Club — to see what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
Clearly Moore&#39;s Law has evolved, this year&#39;s tech toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same, if not a little less, compared to last year.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most well-known of these, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offerings.
And button battery toys are on the rise, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, unless otherwise noted.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for ages 3 and up) are guinea pig-sized plush toys that sing a note when you squeeze them on their stomachs.
One press equals one note, and a second press composes a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Warning: once you start pressing, you can&#39;t stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for ages 2 and up) is the best choice.
Drawing inspiration from technology from last year&#39;s Elmo Live, the 14-inch animatronic doll takes turns playing games like Simon Says and can do the moon dance thanks to her innovative articulated legs with locking wheels.
Kids who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you&#39;re a kid from the 80s, you&#39;ll remember Alphie, one of the first computer-based educational toys.
He&#39;s back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for ages 3 and up), with a backpack full of quiz cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with self-correction and a valve workbook.
If you&#39;re wary of your child holding your smartphone, here are three standalone alternatives.
VTech&#39;s Mobigo ($60, ages 3-8) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, though games don&#39;t educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for ages 3-12), this is the first major revision to the Leapster range, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
The Fisher-Price iXL ($90, ages 3 to 7) uses an iTunes-like system to deliver games and e-books and has an SD card slot that lets you display photos of family.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for ages 8 and up) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a matchbox, each with its own LED screen.
The objective is to form words by placing the blocks in a line before time runs out, ideal for an impromptu spelling bee.
More and more, toys have some sort of online connection.
Based on their presence in toy stores alone, the two biggest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a Club Penguin pet online, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2&quot; Mix &#39;N Match Figure Pack, $5, for ages 6-12) which includes a piece marked with a a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child receives enough Club Penguin store credit for two items of their choice.
It can be roller skates or a Puffle toy pet.
Slightly larger than the bristle at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, ages 5 and up) is the latest button-battery-powered micro-bot.
The faux critter moves quickly across 12 vibrating silicone batters in random directions.
It&#39;s fun to make a block maze to see if she can find her way through.
She is also solid.
Ours withstood a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage in the mouth of our dog.
Bringing a Softer Side to Policing in China
Tang Shenbin paced a city square like an urban sergeant in training, sternly inspecting his nerve charges, quietly issuing commands with military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan – towering officials of public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and penchant for violence – to convey a certain impression to a set of spectators.
&quot;Stand straight!&quot;
&quot;Be sharp!&quot;
Show them, he said, &quot;what pretty girls look like!&quot;
Four girls barely past their teens in white gloves, dressed in identical olive-colored jackets and pants, stood frozen at attention.
Four pairs of black high-heeled shoes, lined up with a ruler.
Four neat hats perched perfectly atop hair tied with a blue and white striped bow.
“I personally think they look average,” Mr. Tang said dismissively.
&quot;The models are pretty.&quot;
More than one government has tried to spruce up the image of China&#39;s urban inspectors.
One city required all new hires to have a college degree.
Guangdong province swapped the grey-green of the uniforms for a supposedly more engaging blue.
Wuhan, central China, has replaced looking down with the hard way:: In 2009, a report said 50 officers surrounded an out-of-control snack cart with glares, firmly for half an hour, until the peddler packs up his things and leaves.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, chose to do a big image operation.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its urban street police with 13 women, specially chosen for their looks, build and young age.
The idea is to give the rough-hewn font a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might struggle to draw attention to this underground urban brigade of China.
And for good reason, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce municipal ordinances by imposing fines or other administrative penalties.
But Chinese media portray the news from a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei province inspectors beat an observer to death after he used his cell phone to film them breaking up a protest at a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and posted online, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without emitting blood.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon peddler was left with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A violence-infused video game, available for download online, shows trained Chinese inspectors assaulting street vendors.
&quot;Chengguan has marked the government,&quot; China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after yet another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for a &quot;real thorough cleaning.&quot;
Skeptics say the approach is a long way off.
After the district advertised in October for eight new female recruits, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News questioned whether the women had real jobs or were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district announcement required female applicants, ages 18 to 22, to have a good figure and &quot;all five facial features in the correct order.&quot;
They should be taller than average, 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
Retirement at age 26 is compulsory.
Officers said the work was too physically demanding for women over 25.
&quot;It&#39;s their image that&#39;s important,&quot; a certain district officer told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
&quot;First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are suitable; these are height, weight, facial features, etc.&quot;
Then come temperament and &quot;inner qualities.&quot;
Chengguan women are like flower vases, he said, adding, &quot;Besides being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the city&#39;s district management office, disagrees with this description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job postings for both genders.
Such is the case of the requirement relating to the order of facial features.
Whether that means beautiful is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, disabled or disfigured people should not apply.
&quot;We can&#39;t let a lame person or a hunchback come to serve here,&quot; Zheng said.
&quot;He wouldn&#39;t give a good image.&quot;
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has dappled cheeks with a finely curved mouth.
She doesn&#39;t consider highlighting her appearance to be sexist, she said.
&quot;Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?&quot; she asked wryly.
Xu Yang, her 21-year-old dimpled colleague, said, &quot;Our job is to present the image of the city.&quot;
They don&#39;t object to term limits, they said, because they harbor greater career ambitions than simply chasing vendors down the alleys where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team battles a dozen fast-moving street vendors on foot or on bicycle, trying to sell as many buns or bowls of tofu as possible before fleeing.
&quot;Master Wang, you must leave.&quot;
&quot;We&#39;ve already told you many times!&quot; , Ms. Xu said as a vendor fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle cart bicycle.
Officers describe their duties as monotonous rather than strenuous.
&quot;It&#39;s pretty much the same every day,&quot; said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing after work.
&quot;Great routine.&quot;
One of the reasons is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate property from sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to shield them from sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rioted after false rumors spread that chengguan officers had killed a vendor.
In one night, more than a dozen police and chengguan officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from placid Baoguang Square, where female officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as their regulations dictate.
The owner of the motorcycle was crying foul.
A 15-minute standoff ensued before the grim-faced officers elbowed their way to their vehicle and sped off with the motorbike and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men&#39;s team, stayed behind, his white badge turned over to hide his name.
Like the female officers, the coordinators - men aged 40 or over - play purely a supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not formed to maintain a waxed image.
&quot;Sometimes we fight verbally.&quot;
&quot;Sometimes we fight physically,&quot; Mr. Li said matter-of-factly.
&quot;Most of the time it&#39;s the public who start.&quot;
Prosecutors won&#39;t charge Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have dropped criminal charges against Sen. John Ensign, stemming from a case related to a former campaign aide and his efforts to secure lobbying work for the woman&#39;s husband, the senator&#39;s lawyers announced on Wednesday.
The ruling ends the most serious legal threat facing Mr Ensign, the Republican from Nevada who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate from 2012 until the scandal surrounding his case hit the headlines nationals last year and harming his career.
Mr Ensign&#39;s office said it was &quot;very pleased&quot; with the decision, the result of a year-long investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate ethics committee.
Lawyers for Mr Ensign said the Justice Department had &#39;advised that Senator Ensign is no longer under investigation and does not intend to pursue any charges against him in that case.&quot;
The Department of Justice declined to comment on this.
The announcement came as something of a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department who believe there is significant evidence that Mr. Ensign conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in The New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a job as lucrative lobbying to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, over the senator&#39;s affair with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as Treasurer in an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then advocated for them after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; according to documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been an aide to Mr. Ensign, he was barred by law for a year from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual deal between Mr Ensign and Mr Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appears to contradict the so-called revolving door ban on lobbying.
From the evidence that has been made public, &quot;there appears to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to breach and material breach of the Revolving Door Act,&quot; said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney. who specializes in defending clients from investigation by the government.
Although the department&#39;s judge declined to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared wary of political prosecution after a number of High-level setbacks by its public integrity section, including the decision last year to drop charges against former senator Ted Stevens on charges of misconduct.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the Citizens&#39; Executive Director for Accountability and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
&quot;This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don&#39;t apply to them&quot;, she added.
Paul Coggins, lead attorney for Mr Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department attorney on Monday and followed up the next day, telling him the department was not looking no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign&#39;s legal team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed in a statement Wednesday, &quot;acted within the law.&quot;
Mr. Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he had made to the prosecution.
&quot;I&#39;m not comfortable going into detail about my discussions with the Justice Department except to say that we believe they made the right decision,&quot; he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to drop an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign&#39;s parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada company that has long backed the senator, is one firm Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work for.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company onboarded Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign&#39;s chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that &#39;pounding&#39; the Home Office on a disputed issue.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and he asked the Secretary of Transportation to schedule a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr. Hampton to do some lobbying.
When news of the affair surfaced last year, Mr Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth-ranked Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to seek a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department&#39;s lead and put end of his investigation.
Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing her hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire&#39;s call will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were typing away in the rows of the courtroom.
They were sending reports of gruesome testimonials every minute via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said there were more than 140,000 posts about the rape case trial and the children tied to their beds in a house that was burned down.
On Thursday, the widely watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of murdering three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to come to an official end where the judge would impose the death sentence, voted on by the jury .
But Mr. Hayes&#39; lawyers have already filed material in court that outlines appeal arguments, likely to occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reporting of the trial - together with journalists&#39; widespread and extensive use of Twitter - has created a &quot;circus atmosphere&quot;, a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary detail that the jury was badly influenced by the passions of the public.
The demand could prompt appeals judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
“I experienced it during this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the courtrooms undermines the human rights to a fair trial”, said Thomas J. Ullmann, attorney for Mr. Hayes, chief counsel.
State Superior Court trial judge Jon C. Bleue laconically dismissed the claims in the ruling issued last week, saying the media was &quot;carefully controlled&quot; and there was no evidence according to which the jury would have been driven by passion.
But that doesn&#39;t seem to be the last word on the matter.
Appeals courts have recognized for decades that media coverage of high-profile cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 judgment, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in its decision that there was a &quot;carnival atmosphere at the trial&quot; because of the media.
The crime is believed by some to have been the inspiration for the TV show and movie &quot;The Fugitive&quot;.
Some lawyers said the appellate courts seized to review Mr Hayes&#39;s conviction half a century later may be puzzling given the argument that new rules may be needed to deal with the halls&#39; means of communication. audience, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard&#39;s case.
&quot;There&#39;s a general reason to be concerned about the impact of new media&quot; in high-profile trials, said John J. Donohue III, a Stanford Law School professor who has studied the death penalty. died in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily enforced.
Professor Donohue says some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could allow for fairer trials.
The Twitter case is just one of many described by Mr. Hayes&#39; lawyers, likely to be discussed for years; which delays the execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr Hayes was allegedly harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them grisly photos of crime scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and will argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical in front of prosecutors, and that he improperly pushed for a verdict by taking the unusual step of having the jury deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors were not sequestered.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial might be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a challenge to the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and was being discussed on the campaign trail by gubernatorial and U.S. Senate candidates.
They maintained that the computer media kept fanning the flames of emotion in the case.
“The daily scramble of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the courthouse,” the attorneys wrote, “was unlike anything seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even in nationwide.&quot;
Their emphasis on coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In interviews, some reporters said the claim that instant news was more inflammatory than slower-delivered releases was a Luddist view that would impoverish court policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said appeals courts are often drawn to arguments that social and technological changes require courts to adapt.
Lawyers for Mr. Hayes insist on this claim.
In their filing, they make a reference to the 1966 Supreme Court decision which overturned Dr Sheppard&#39;s conviction due to media coverage of the trial and they specified that they would cite the need for new rules for new media. .
“This case,” they wrote, “represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century.”
Can civility bridge the divides?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a modicum of civility erupted in Washington this week.
Is this a harbinger of true bipartisan cooperation forward or an illusory moment before the rapid return to partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday&#39;s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no breakthrough on the big issues that need to be addressed during the &quot;lame duck&quot; session.
But clearly there was at least a polite discussion of the differences between the two sides as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points. Supporter point scoring blank.
Wednesday&#39;s open meeting of the President&#39;s Deficit Committee was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain among members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect transcending the ideological divide; but which, however, still divides the members.
It&#39;s barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two sides are now in a period of mutual trial and testing for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to gauge the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
That&#39;s why Tuesday&#39;s meeting and subsequent comments from attendees exposed minimal demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it&#39;s taxes, expenses, health care or rights, the two parties remain miles apart.
Yet the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
&quot;There&#39;s no doubt things have changed in tone,&quot; said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now with the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
&quot;It&#39;s inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse partisan passions and then they fade.
It&#39;s good.&quot;
On some issues, including those on the agenda for the &quot;lame duck&quot; session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
The Bush tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of it, permanently or temporarily.
Likewise, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, if only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, while denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday&#39;s meeting at the White House, more optimism hangs over a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the &quot;lame duck&quot;, with the ratification of the &quot;New START&quot; pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the &quot;lame duck&quot; session will not necessarily lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
“Once the things that need to be done are done, the psychology in the short term will go back to one of confrontations,” he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
&quot;I consider most of what happens between now and 2012 pre-show or shadow-boxing to the main event of 2012,&quot; he said.
The reasons for this are closely linked to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present at the tea party who helped create it.
But Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know they must try to live up to their promises to cut public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first reactions to the deficit committee&#39;s recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, raising the retirement age and cutting spending. .
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the toughest jobs in Washington and have, they say, pushed the deficit issue onto the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the 18-member commission to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have struggled to reach that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the chosen ones of the group; suggesting that on tax issues, at least today, there is little incentive or willingness to compromise.
Galston foresees two phases in the fighting between the White House and congressional Republicans.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and health care; only to be followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
Public opinion.
There is ample evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as in 1995, then both sides will watch the public reaction carefully.
Whoever will be judged at a loss will have to change course and find compromises.
But that would be an optimistic view nonetheless.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there appears to be a greater ideological divide between Obama and congressional Republicans than there was. then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as just a prelude to a more consequential election in 2012.
Given that reality, the civility on display this week might be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take a lot more effort from both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked US documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a &quot;Kleptocracy&quot; and funnels some of the bribes and protection money it collects to the Kremlin, the U.S. embassy said. United in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service carry out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of the bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the &quot;power vertical&quot; - takes its share as the money trickles up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written when Yury Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there have been few signs of the cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Baturina, who owns a leading construction company, have consistently denied corruption charges over the years; and he won several libel suits on these charges.
In September, he told a Russian TV channel the following when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: &quot;It&#39;s crazy, it&#39;s trash, it&#39;s rubbish .&quot;
Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information stated in an embassy report; and it is unheard of to conceive that it would be up to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The Moscow city government&#39;s direct link to crime led some people to call it &#39;dysfunctional&#39; and to argue that the government operated more like a kleptocracy than a government,&quot; according to the embassy note. .
&quot;Criminal elements enjoy a &#39;krysha&#39; (a term used in the criminal/mafia world which literally means &#39;roof&#39; or protection) which passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor&#39;s office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
&quot;Analysts identify a three-tier structure in Moscow&#39;s criminal underworld.&quot;
&quot;Luzhkov is at the top.&quot;
&quot;The FSB, the MVD and the militias are on the second level.&quot;
&quot;Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.&quot;
&quot;It is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a void in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services.&quot;
The report says the FSB is brewing money from the biggest companies and the police are targeting the small ones.
One source, he said, &quot;explained that business owners in Moscow understood that it was better to get protection from the MVD and the FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only, they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law.”
&quot;This is the reason why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high.&quot;
The note points out that although the collection of money is extensive, the protection itself can be patchy; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business shut down under one pretext or another.
Medvedev spoke several times about the fight against corruption, but he admitted that little progress had been made.
The embassy note carries reports of men bringing suitcases, probably filled with cash, to the Kremlin.
&quot;In his fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats,&quot; said Gueorgui Satarov, director of the Moscow think tank Indem, in a recent interview.
&quot;But he is part of this bureaucracy.&quot;
&quot;He is not part of a political class because there is none in Russia.&quot;
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the costs of corruption would amount, across Russia as a whole, to more than 300 billion dollars a year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The disclosure of the US Embassy note, which was only made late yesterday evening, Moscow time, is sure to stir up discontent within the Russian government; although Luzhkov can be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow&#39;s failures, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin speculated that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fabrication and reacted angrily to the leaked remarks by US diplomats calling him Batman and linking Medvedev with Robin.
&quot;The problem is that it&#39;s about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country,&quot; he said.
&quot;But to be honest with you, we had no idea it would be done with such arrogance, pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics.&quot;
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a dimly lit classroom with decrepit, shoddy concrete walls, the principal of Anlong Veng Secondary School reminisced about the man who built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
&quot;Everyone here loves Ta Mok.&quot;
&quot;He was a good leader; and he cared about his people,&quot; said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as &quot;the butcher&quot; for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, longstanding loyalty to Anlong Veng is finally being challenged.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook there which, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, run jointly with the United Nations, handed down its first sentence against a former member of the Khmer Rouge, sentencing the former head of the notorious Tuol torture center to 35 years in prison. Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as &quot;Duch&quot;.
In the face of this development, anxiety has increased among former Khmer Rouge fighters in Anlong Veng; complicating reconciliation efforts and their desire to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
&quot;There are resentments and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything about it,&quot; said Chhang Youk, director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, an independent body that conducts research on the regime. .
&quot;For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil.&quot;
&quot;The situation is creating divisions within families.&quot;
During Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the United Pol Pot government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to Cambodia&#39;s border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurgency which lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrillas from their base in the western mountains of Cambodia and the jungle, Ta Mok prepared a follow-up at Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace accord led to the country&#39;s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the government, culminating in the capitulations of &#39;Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had stood up, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without their benefactors, most Khmer Rouge veterans sank into the squalor common to rural Cambodia; and many are those who remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officers have kept their local leadership positions in exchange for laying down their arms, these are unskilled farmers with low rank and record.
&quot;These people received very little follow-up after the surrender,&quot; said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
&quot;They are steeped in the regime&#39;s agrarian utopian ideology.&quot;
&quot;They were brought up in an environment where doing business is a foreign concept.&quot;
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
&quot;Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,&quot; he said.
&quot;Ta Mok feeds everyone.&quot;
But now life is hard because we have to support ourselves.&quot;
The ongoing Khmer Rouge tribunal has also caused concern here.
The court is expected early next year to start trying Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court&#39;s mandate is to try top leaders and those most responsible for the crimes but it did not say whether it would pursue beyond those four cases.
It would take more to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation has turned to 64-year-old Im Chaem, a former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province under Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Documentation Center of Cambodia that she oversaw the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of forced laborers are believed to have died.
Recently, on a scorching evening, Im Chaem was returning from work at the field near his wooden stilt house on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the parched grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his Khmer Rouge past.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
&quot;Cambodia is peaceful and stable,&quot; she said.
&quot;If there are more prosecutions, there will be war.&quot;
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court prosecuted multiple suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
&quot;Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,&quot; he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia needs to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang of the documentation centre.
“Reconciliation in Khmer terms is reconnecting the broken pieces,” he says.
&quot;We have to put these pieces together so that we can understand.&quot;
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, &quot;A History of Democratic Kampuchea, consisting of 75 pages.&quot;
He distributed it in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education&#39;s history textbooks, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the town&#39;s ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he returned home with the book to study.
&quot;My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court,&quot; he says.
&quot;They&#39;re suspicious because they don&#39;t know exactly how many people the court will prosecute.&quot;
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are starting to have an impact, he said.
Still, the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful appeal here.
High in the Dangrek Mountains, a path, overgrown with weeds and strewn with plastic bags, leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot&#39;s body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside mobile phone vendor, said she didn&#39;t know much about the man who was cremated there.
&quot;But it has a great spirit; and many locals go there to pray,&quot; she said.
It was Nuom Sothea&#39;s birthday and later that day she planned to walk to Pol Pot&#39;s final resting place where she would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in hopes of bringing good luck .
Belarus agrees to give up its weapons-grade uranium stockpile
The government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it would abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, an essential component for nuclear weapons; the move is part of a surprise victory for President Obama&#39;s campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide
The deal was disclosed in a joint statement issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The US government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But US officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
That paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to dispose of the remaining material of about 500 pounds, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the initiative of Obama; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was profitable to procure an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit in 2012.
&quot;I&#39;m really fascinated that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit Nuclear Security Summit.&quot;
“It proves to me that this process works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton called the deal &quot;a very significant, important step&quot; taken by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama&#39;s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said the nation would never give up its uranium.
&quot;We kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially weapons-grade uranium and low-enriched uranium,&quot; Lukashenko said at the time.
&quot;It&#39;s our product... We&#39;re not going to make dirty bombs, and we&#39;re not going to sell it to anyone.&quot;
&quot;We&#39;re going to use it for research purposes, that&#39;s all.&quot;
Belarus moved closer to the United States a few months ago; however, by expressing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material had been lightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia for storage and disposal, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The US government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus&#39; research facilities with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
&quot;Careful coordination and organization have been implemented with a view to building trust&quot;; leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official specializing in Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates by the James Martin Nonproliferation Center, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko&#39;s harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday&#39;s statement hinted at a potential revival.
&quot;While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remain essential to improving bilateral relations; and indispensable to the progress of the country and its citizens,&quot; she said.
The government has no objection to the CIA flights
The government had no objection to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the US ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents leaked (cables) by Wikileaks to the daily El País, which add that the then First Vice-President of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed to &quot;to be able to demonstrate that they exercised adequate vigilance on foreign planes crossing Spain&quot;.
In June 2006, after a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries of complicity in practices contrary to human rights, including Spain, a meeting took place between the former US ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernandez de la Vega.
The vice-president acknowledged that the Council&#39;s report &quot;caught Zapatero&#39;s government offside&quot; and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
&quot;De la Vega underlined that Spain has no objection regarding intelligence thefts over Spanish territory.&quot;
&quot;They just want to be informed&quot; to avoid being &quot;taken by surprise&quot;, says Aguirre in a cable.
The holder of the Ministry of External Affairs at that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive &quot;wanted to give this case the lowest profile possible, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges , the Government had a limited ability to influence&quot;.
In turn, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge&#39;s initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI ) and the Department of Defense on CIA flights.
“These reports contain no incriminating material, no sensitive information,” the Embassy explained after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States nevertheless showed its concern for the &quot;apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors&quot; more than for the declassified information from CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
&quot;This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to maneuver the case discreetly between Governments,&quot; regrets Aguirre.
In the month of March of 2007 during a lunch between the ambassador of the United States and the minister of Internal Affairs, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, this one commented to him that &quot;even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of his independence and will do what &#39;they consider adequate&#39;, he had instructed his staff to &#39;avoid inflammatory rhetorical comments, trying to lower the temperature&#39;.
The ambassador also expresses his concern for the action of the PP in this matter.
&quot;Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that Zapatero&#39;s government has condoned or deliberately ignored actions by the United States that could be construed as possible violations. of human rights, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States&quot;, she points out.
The parricide who confessed complained in the network of the &quot;overwhelm&quot; of being a mother
The girl spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: &quot;Galician-style terror&quot;
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is &quot;Muki&quot; in the network.
With this nickname that she uses as soon as she was little, communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; both from Noia, the village in La Coruña where she is from.
The posts are from 2008.
To hear them, you have to know his love life, which ABC builds with the help of testimonies from his parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had initiated a relationship in 1998 with industrialist Iván Túñez.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they broke up, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get the DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
With him, she cohabited for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the young girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the job market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But according to the content of his communications, we hear that their idyll has fractured, they have separated.
In March 2008 she is in Menorca, alone, and writes: &quot;Alberto is very strange and upset for the fact that I came to work there.&quot;
&quot;When I told him, it seemed like a good thing to him, but of course he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants. wanna&quot;.
And then she talks about a mobile message she had just received: &quot;I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send the child to you&quot;.
Ella complains: &quot;If he doesn&#39;t like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I&#39;ll take it when I get back,&quot; she alleges.
In May, she talks about going back to work in her village: &quot;This week I&#39;m leaving, but I&#39;ll only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to report to a job so as not to lose&quot;.
She explains that if all was well, she would have taken her eldest with her.
&quot;He will stay with the correct person, which is with me, and I will never leave him in my life with another person if that person is not my mother&quot;, questionable intention, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July, there is another post.
When she types it, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived at the island on the 1st of that month, and he was supposedly murdered on the 10th, is dead.
&quot;Caesar is happy on one side, but not on another.&quot;
&quot;On the one hand he is with me and he likes this place a little, but on the other hand he goes to school almost every day&quot;.
She talks about a trip to Majorca.
“He will go there (the child) for a few summer hours and that way I save a little money from the babysitter”.
On the 17th, greetings and complaints.
&quot;A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you will come.&quot;
&quot;Alberto says he emailed you some videos, you know, when he wants, he finds me, shit&quot;.
On the 30th, another: &quot;The child is fine, he is going during the summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Víctor, his current partner, there is one: &quot;He advances me money&quot;.
On the Internet she posts in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the now-blocked MySpace universe, where her name was &quot;Muki the Jail Liberator.&quot;
&quot;Terror à la Galician (epigraph)&quot;.
The last man who lived with her, Vigilante, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn&#39;t want to think that it was all over that she hadn&#39;t told him about the fact that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial penitentiary of Palma yesterday, coming from the center for judicial detainees in Menorca.
The official lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she does not remember how the facts happened, &quot;nor did she intend to harm the minor&quot;.
Before, she had confessed to drowning Cesar in the bathtub and putting his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
Popular Party members would gain 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the important increase in votes and deputies registered in the last autonomic elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the general elections because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation obtains in these comices normally doubles that which it receives in the Catalan ones.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the general elections of 2008, while in the autonomic elections of 2006, they had obtained 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC obtained 384,091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend, desired of a diversion of votes of the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, the analysts of this formation have calculated the fact that, if there would be general elections, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also gain four (it now has 10) and PSC would lose neither more nor less than 9 deputies (it has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP - it has three now - while ICV would keep one MP or gain one.
But if the electoral agenda is maintained, the next appointment would take place in May 2011 for the municipal elections, where the people can also be decisive for the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both the nationalists and the popular agree that PSC could lose the town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not obtain the majority either the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV .
Taking into account the republican debacle, it would not be fanciful that this formation loses its representation in the town hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain the 5% of the votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they governed with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign they met several times.
The popular ones have registered progress also in other important municipalities like Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
At present, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in as many localities as possible.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven detained in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian detained by agents of the General Information Commission of the Barcelona Police formed a jihadist cell which, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different Al Qaeda groups, including &quot;The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land&quot; (LTTE) and &quot;Laskar e Taiba&quot; (Let), the latter being the author of the attacks in Bombay which caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ascertaining the fact that with &quot;Operation Kampai&quot; the apparatus of falsification of Al Qaeda has &quot;been debilitated&quot; at an international level and &quot;by consequently, its operational capacity&quot;.
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to the groups that integrated the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its &quot; combatants&quot; can cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network kept operative in Europe, that is why in the investigations have participated, apart from the Thai services, other European police units, that is why in the territory of the European Union there could be in the following days strikes similar to the one recorded last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), another was carried out in Thailand, with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were the ones who directed from Bangkok the cell established in Spain and in other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole tourists&#39; passports that met the conditions set by the so-called &quot;World Islamic Front&quot;.
That is to say, the documents had to be in the names of young men aged between 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
Investigators point out that so far no detail has been found that connects the detainees in Catalonia with the bombing in Bombay, even though the author of this attack, &quot;Laskar e Taiba&quot;, was one of the groups receivers of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, a few thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia through a transfer agency which were &quot;invested&quot; to buy mobile cards which were used later by members of the &quot;commando&quot; who killed 106 people.
The police seized a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally explain to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as President of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and which boil down to giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignist adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to approach halfway through his mandate.
The president of the popular Catalans arrived at the appointment with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be liked, because the CiU candidate requires that at least one of the formations that the opposition will exercise abstains in the vote of the investiture.
On a possible agreement with the PP depend the future alliances that the nationalists wish to maintain in the Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are done in Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an investiture &quot;it would be necessary to eliminate all sovereigntist and separatist speeches&quot;, and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bet to make thin the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax applied to inheritances and donations.
Details of the negotiation on the investiture of Mas will take care of the part of PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised tough opposition -, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric says the deaths were not due to &quot;lack of measures&quot;
The owners of the center of Olot do not rule out the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
Those responsible for the geriatric La Caritat d&#39;Olot (Girona) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people of whom he was responsible in the meantime that he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself accompanied by the lawyer of the center, Joan Cañada and announced that &quot;the desire of La Caritat would be that of being able to exercise the accusation against the person responsible&quot; for the dead but &quot; legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural position of civil responsible persons&quot;.
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat for La Caritat now takes the form of significant compensation that the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from that day he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - because he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and the pathologies patients, the formality took place by telephone.
La Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that &quot;the lack of measures could not have been at any time the cause of what happened&quot;.
La Caritat&#39;s lawyer added that &quot;in this case there is only an indication of recklessness on the part of anyone other than the accused&quot;.
The person already baptized as the &quot;Angel of Death&quot; confessed to 11 murders the day before yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother .
In this case he caused her death by injecting her with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pellets.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control the access of the staff of the center to medicines.
The insulin injections and the cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes that the orderly, in his desire to relieve the suffering of the interns, used to kill them.
But the laboratory analyzes will clarify if Vila is not lying by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he has already confessed that he has done with the three women he killed in the interval 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of murders admitted, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way of killing after having successfully committed eight assassinations.
This is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to yesterday&#39;s threat from Trichet who warned that &quot;markets should not underestimate our ability to react&quot;.
Peripheral spreads closed strong and European bank stocks fell more than 5%.
However, we also shouldn&#39;t underestimate ECB&#39;s ability to err and the euro barely registered an increment, which is a concerned signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way that it is crashing, it is recovering, but driven by very speculative short position closings.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose the fear.
A month ago ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those remaining.
Bundesbank demanded the finalization of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary measures of term liquidity and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, let&#39;s hope that the current liquidity measures are extended &quot;at least until March&quot; and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond buying program and that we even give the signal to intensify it.
If they don&#39;t fulfill the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blindly to withdraw the liquidity measures, God help us!
Just like during their May meeting where they said they hadn&#39;t even considered buying bonds and they crashed the markets, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
BCE must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and on Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing another collapse in the market.
Yesterday the auction of one-year bills in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million at 5.28% compared to 750 million at 4.81% of the previous bid.
Even so, types in Portugal were down 30 basis points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet&#39;s words.
In Ireland the hole figures of Allied and Bank of Ireland have been published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potential and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumable in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a hotbed of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to release the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14 in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of Beethoven&#39;s hymn of joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity yesterday to present the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to the ears of investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double Trichet and ZP effect explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange suffered the 4.5%, double that of the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was quick and radical and we benefited from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond which will benefit from the Trichet Effect, so we hope this resolves with strong demand and helps dispel doubts about our ability to refinancing.
For Spain to ask for an Assistance Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we don&#39;t need, the Treasury has over 40,000 million in available liquidity, triple that of March, to very expensive types and they cut off access to the markets indefinitely.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar&#39;s wife, &quot;apart from being, appearing&quot;.
Courage, we can get out of this!
The president of Eulen will challenge the advice of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not cease in the open conflict within the bosom of the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will contest, because he considers it &quot;null by right&quot;, the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of the titular firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their litigation for the control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest business services holding for companies does not seem to be willing to give in to his dispute to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
He was expelled from his board of directors by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors at the shareholders&#39; meeting of January 18 this year, the challenge to which is registered in the Trade and Companies Register.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, has opened the box of thunders again within the Álvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the meeting is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism which guarantees the convening of the meeting.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as a &quot;desperate recourse of the plaintiffs his five sons to try, through a procedural quibble, clearly defrauding the Law and abusing the right , to validate and correct the radically null assembly on January 18&quot;, according to its official spokespersons.
This argumentation will be the basis for, once the meeting takes place, to be contested by considering that it is &quot;void of right&quot;.
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully to have the magistrate convene an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a patrimonial company and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group nevertheless requests the usufruct of 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue for the judge to decide after the hearing on the challenge application for which there is not yet a date reported.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software creates improvements on cars in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select world of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into account the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the triumph of Fernando Alonso&#39;s Ferrari.
Without diminishing the skill as a driver of the champion, the German Sebastien Vette, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 we speak of the legend of the &quot;secret weapon&quot; that the company multinational Siemens has put at the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives far removed from the high motoring competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computing instrument has been used to create assembly lines of manufacturing factories all over the world, energy stations, high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or the process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding defects and avoidable costs.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi planes or Nissan&#39;s most famous utility vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory has enabled Red Bull to create and execute &quot;in a few hours, almost in real time&quot;, the modifications, changes and improvements detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 teams had an average of 10 technicians on their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four vehicle upgrades each season.
The Red Bull team currently employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications to the cars.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull cars except the engine, which is Renault&#39;s exclusive responsibility.
We modify the materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements.
Changes can go from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limitation of this madness of technological perfection is the amount of 40 million dollars that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to create and produce its cars in a locality 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered &quot;top secret&quot;.
The staff for this duty numbers 580 people, including two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull&#39;s Formula 1 hero, arguably, is recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and whose notoriety is nil.
Factory technology director Steve Nevey says five years ago you could argue that R+D advances in racing cars brought 50% of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest. .
Today these percentages have changed and the technology represents the 85% of the success, while the pilots bring the 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by IT, because &quot;they are unpredictable gladiators&quot;.
HP will install in two years 20 own stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to set up in Spain over the next two years.
The company will count this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the redesigned store located on Barcelona&#39;s Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to set up 200 branded points of sale in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first open were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, that of Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, although she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM personal systems assured that the philosophy for setting up the stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and deals with the design of the exclusive furniture of the stores (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
In addition, HP covers facility staff training.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and pointed out that the exclusive network of shops claims to &quot;improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchasing, assistance, post-sales and even packaging &quot;.
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering worldwide pilot program that solves possible problems with HP computer equipment under warranty.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Holland).
&quot;So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days.&quot;
&quot;This system is designed especially for MSEs and users, because the big companies have already contracted technical assistance services&quot;, remarked Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on &#39;stealing&#39; a million customers from its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell&#39;s managing director, Jaime Guardiola, thinks that 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
Despite this, he foresees a collapse in interest margins, which we will try to partially offset with increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years, its task to accomplish.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit for the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
In 2011, the bank will launch a new master plan which will be valid for three years.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need to resort to public subsidies from FROB, is to gain a market rating by capturing one million new individual customers - 700,000 if we deduct those who can leave the bank- , its great task to accomplish, because until now this bank had spoiled SMEs and companies more than the individual client.
This year it captured 250,000 individual customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market rating for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the bet on productivity, or what is the same thing, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when presenting the results of the &#39;exercise.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, because the financial crisis has upset all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its master plan Optima, established four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for one more year.
Customers who fail savings banks will be his main target.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a &quot;difficult and transcendental&quot; year.
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit from the crisis in Spain &quot;will be slow&quot;.
In addition, in two or three years it will be &quot;very difficult to create jobs&quot;, which is fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the liability war - which penalizes margins - is shrinking, the price of the risk premiums that banks and credit unions pay for their issues to obtain liquidity are already shifting to the price of credit to compensate for the fall. margins.
“The liquidity and funding aspect is structural and will be a credit pressure factor.”
&quot;We haven&#39;t tightened the tap, but the differentials are higher,&quot; admitted Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías of November 22 and 27-.
He also admitted that the tendency of the banking sector now &quot;is to increase commissions&quot;, but &quot;there is a competitive framework&quot;.
Sabadell&#39;s master plan is based on organic growth although, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain &quot;larger dimensions will be requested.&quot;
“Everything will change next year,” he assured.
He affirms that the capital requirements &quot;are increasing enormously&quot; and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentions that the FROB can replace the market in the capture of funds in the case of new recapitalizations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the temporal closing of the markets, he diminished the importance of the fact that some bankers are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that one cannot issue, but contrary to what happened in June, one can obtain short-term financing through repos, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the caisses
CECA&#39;s managing director, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of savings bank mergers and insisted again on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is taking place.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that assured that they were not going to participate in this first phase and that they reserved themselves for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
&quot;I think most of the mergers have been done, we cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, they are adjustments.&quot;
&quot;Most of it has been carried out completely; it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation as well “, underlined the leader.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Managers and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration is being carried out &quot;at the greatest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way that &#39;it is being carried out within the deadlines that we have set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain,&#39; he emphasized.
&quot;The passage from 45 boxes with an average of 28,500 million in volume of assets to 17 with 75,500 million is a process without equal in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger for be Basel compliant,&quot; he said.
Olavarrieta admitted that &quot;there is a series of rather unhappy opinions on the slowness of the process&quot; which demonstrate &quot;a lack of seriousness and meaning&quot;, because &quot;what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we must meet the deadline before the end of the year&quot;.
The director general of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and &quot;probably&quot; in the world and he attributed to those who questioned it a &quot;lack of knowledge&quot;.
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, &quot;we can remain very calm&quot; with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has begun a &quot;very important&quot; process of concentration and &quot;is going to the greatest possible speed.
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector came out well from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin opted to stay in the euro, but it set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions provoked a dual government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private employment agencies or the abolition of the 426 euro aid for unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of the 49% of AENA, management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel regarding her responsibility to untie the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that Merkel&#39;s position is not an error in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, in Germany people are beginning to speculate on the three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, although now it seems like science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new conception of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macro-economic control, budgetary rigor, fines for countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has long been defined, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought we should do (fiscal austerity plans and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second blow to the Central European country was when Merkel hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From then on it was the object of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public and published opinion were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, asking for the reform of the treaties of the Union to make possible the rescue of a country and at the same time oblige the private lenders to support a part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although a little watered down, was approved and, in the following months, we should witness the process of reform of the Union that will make these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think it will cross.
And she tells us all that, even if now we have to take measures with which we may not really agree, from that date the old functioning of the euro would have ended .
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries which break the rules will be severely sanctioned, they may be forced to declare themselves insolvent and, in this case, the private sector will also bear part of the costs.
Germany signals to us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as that which presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be bad not to hear it.
It is not only a question of renewing the public deficit at 3% in 2013.
What is asked of us is much harder.
And what he must absolutely not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turmoil brings greater tranquility to us.
And that we know how to seize the opportunity we have been given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard it in this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday&#39;s meeting with big business and yesterday&#39;s announcement of the new measures) suggests that, despite criticism from Merkel, we paved the way for the thesis that we must put our house in order.
But the red line Germany has drawn is there, and they don&#39;t seem to be moving it.
And among the possibilities that we are considering, we cannot exclude that of abandoning a monetary zone that is too full of unserious countries.
And in this case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she warned us.
Sport and Fraud of the Law
Tricks similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the will to escape punishment.
The expulsion planned in principle by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has caused much ink to flow on the unsportsmanlike nature of such behavior and whether both players are expected to be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before ending the match (which their team already clearly won), the two players deliberately wasted time when they committed fouls to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will end up being leaders of their group, the two players will complete the regulatory sanction during the next match of the play-off against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cards to the next phase.
Eventually, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee sanctioned the team&#39;s coach, José Mourinho, with two matches and various economic sums to the players involved.
The invocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new, if not rather common practice in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, the unwritten but followed rules of the sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the related case is due to the fact that this had as protagonist a team from the entity of Real Madrid (which in its anthem displays nobility and honor and which in past occasions has condemned to a fine its players for similar acts) and the dramatization orchestrated, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds one more episode to his dilated history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate asks if this type of behavior not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of the sport, that is to say, if with these actions one commits a fraud of law; because, indeed, they are respectful actions with the sporting regulations, but seem to elude its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage they cause to sportsmanship.
One of the assets that includes the sportsmanship is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been put in danger, that is to say there has been no play violent.
Another of those benefits that are alluded to with correct play is to prevent the offending team from taking unfair advantage of the opposing team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not accommodate what is normally characterized as cheating o fraud of the law, since its violation of the rules has not been carried out. in secret to try to avoid the penalty, but their action precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty from the referee.
They were waiting and they gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is the type of advantage that offenders obtain from the intentional faults examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put the rival at a disadvantage and neither does one obtain an advantage in the same match, because obviously the result of the action supposes the fact of leaving their own team with fewer players.
And that&#39;s not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn&#39;t rely on those players.
Obviously the advantage consists in the fact that the players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action the players complete a penalty match and move on to the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cartons occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So that climbing the ladder is not so clear that it is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the spirit of sportsmanship, which is still part of making strategic decisions that promote the maximum profit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction (that would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law), otherwise they rather chose the moment in which they submitted to it .
They made a strategic decision without thwarting the penalty or running away from that one.
Even if the boundary between genius and the fraud of the law is diffuse, in this occasion I think we had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises because of two factors: because there were two self-expulsions and because of the manner in which the headmistress conveyed to provoke them.
The damage caused to the principles of the sport by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees willing to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the turrón and the lottery, when December arrives there are also group dinners before Christmas which continue to be the lifeline for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but which due to the crisis have led to a price offensive adjusted to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all of them want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, coincide the businessmen and associations of the sector interviewed.
To further complicate the accounting, this year&#39;s calendar (as New Year&#39;s Eve falls on Friday) has concentrated requests in the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner reservations for the days peak (the 17th and 17th) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of the difficult times, there are many companies which have eliminated the collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying from their own pockets.
No matter what the situation, they all ask for battle prices, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employers&#39; association now does not dare to predict how the holidays will be this month.
&quot;People think a lot before booking.&quot;
&quot;They want to get out but they pay a lot of attention to prices,&quot; he mentions.
The business will go well &quot;for those who give quality at a good price and with a good service&quot;, he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a rung with the crisis, so that the slice around the 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
In a survey in various establishments of the center we note the collapse of requests for the night of the 17th.
The Soteras group indicates that there is a genuine boom in requests for that Friday, with the claim of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar meant more advance reservations, even from the start of the month of November.
&quot;We have done everything possible to maintain the same prices as last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros&quot;, they detail.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after detecting a billing boom since the second half of the year and good, albeit concentrated, Christmas business prospects.
Group sources mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day for groups of friends who celebrate the holidays early.
To their six group menus they have added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as Catalan wine made using the Champagne method - &#39;cava&#39;.
They are also seeing the first signs of improvement in some companies inviting their employees back and feeling that the volume of groups has increased a bit.
On behalf of the Fecasarm patronage (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, trusts in the possibility of beginning to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that globally the reservations are &quot;lively&quot;, even if customers &quot;negotiate to the maximum&quot;.
That&#39;s right, hope for the festivities hasn&#39;t waned, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan&#39;s nuclear program generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad is producing atomic weapons at &quot;a faster rate than any other country&quot;.
Filtrations from Wikileaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the American Embassy in Pakistan and the United States Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program causes in Washington.
Apart from the illuminating and tasty details offered on the content of the conversations and thoughts of the North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that the cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of rise, &quot;decline&quot; and that the unstable Asian country is producing nuclear weapons &quot;at a faster rate than any other country in the world&quot;.
The peculiarity of Pakistan&#39;s nuclear program - the fact that the weapons are not assembled, but are stored in components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
Thus the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report before the visit of the former national security adviser, James Jones: &quot;The proximity of certain nuclear installations to the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersal nuclear materials whose noise runs and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials&quot;.
The sheer number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is viewed, not just by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to maintain custody.
&quot;Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given lower educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs&quot; said expert Yuri Korolev, from the Russian Ministry of Externals during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The news of the documentation filtered by the portal of Julian Assange is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of the nuclear proliferation and the high Pakistani degree of production of nuclear weapons.
A dispatch from the Embassy in May, which described the communication with Pakistan as &quot;frustrating&quot;, maintains that: &quot;Transparency is frequently non-existent; offers of assistance go unanswered or are eliminated&quot;.
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that &quot;despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons at a rate faster than any other country in the world&quot;. .
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it &quot;very clear&quot; to the official that &quot;the Pakistan Army must end with the tacit support of the terrorist groups&quot;.
Hunt for the leader of Wikileaks
Obama will number to a high person in charge for the fight against terrorism to avoid the new infiltrations.
Interpol issues red alert to track movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a &#39;red alert&#39; to &#39;locate and track the movements&#39; of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, this one is not new, otherwise it dates from November 20th.
And this has nothing to do with the latest filtration of more than a quarter million diplomatic documents from the United States but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures that &quot;the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange&quot;.
On the 20th the international police force with headquarters in Lyons (France) dictated the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after having received authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol received the indication to identify or locate Assange &quot;to obtain his provisional arrest and his extradition&quot;.
Even if Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the explanations of the organization, consider the red notice call a free channel for l arrest -- which the national police force must carry out -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange&#39;s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder&#39;s willingness to answer questions from Swedish authorities via video conference.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained the permit to leave Sweden from the prosecutor in his case, who is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin&#39;s security chief.
&quot;It seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution&quot;, denounces the missive.
While the world searches for him - and in Australia his mother defends her son&#39;s innocence - Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday, from an undetermined location, he gave an interview to the editor of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
&quot;If it can be shown that she was responsible for ordering American graduates to spy on the UN in violation of international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign,&quot; he said. .
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request &quot;ridiculous and absurd&quot;.
&quot;I&#39;m not at all sure why the opinion of a guy with a webpage should interest us,&quot; he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior counterterrorism official, Rusell Travers, with preventing further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama&#39;s spokesman&#39;s attempt to downplay Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Congressman Peter King, who from January will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House, has asked the State Department to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations &quot;to confiscate its funds and sue anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance&quot;.
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to backtrack after saying Assange should &quot;be assassinated&quot;.
&quot;Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned aircraft or something similar.&quot;
One person who did not ask for an apology was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, ex-governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
“Whoever is in the Government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything short of an execution would be too kind a punishment,” he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with nods to Carod followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to solve the umpteenth internal revolt inside the ERC, without the north because of the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that absolutely can&#39;t give him headaches he had with other currents off.
That&#39;s why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new critics with winks that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
For starters, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 ERC national advisers will be able to comment on its continuity in secret.
By ballots, not by the raising of hands.
If the carodistes want to convey a certain vote of penalization to the president, they will be able to do it without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a &quot;Bulgarian&quot; result would not be good either.
The people close to Carod demand to the president a little more than to put his position at the disposal of the militancy, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between the congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap until May.
To do this, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the vote of the National Council on the 18th.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the latter&#39;s promise to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders take for granted.
The ERC leader admitted that &quot;polyphony&quot; affects stability and that his goal is to make the organization once and for all able to wash its laundry in the family room.
In this line, the article that the current adviser Josep Huguet has signed in his blog results symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified &quot;in exchange for various objectives&quot; it is as if had been done.
And he listed five of them, of which he underlines two.
The first, &quot;recompose&quot; the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is to say, include new figures who come from the sector adept at Carod.
The second may be the big new character.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate once and for all the assembly as a functioning mechanism.
Thus, he defends a reform of the statutes which allows the realization of the congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulse conclave of 2008 instructed management to revise the assembly model in a specific bylaws reform convention.
This meeting remains unfinished, because the internal tide of the last years did not recommend tackling this subject.
Now, with no critical sectors on the prowl, it might be a good time to take it over and shut it down forever.

China maintains greenhouse gas reduction targets
The representative of this country in the COP16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and detailed that it maintains its offer to reduce until 2020 between 40 and 45 percent its greenhouse gas emissions Greenhouse.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent before 2020, assured Su Wei, representative of this country at COP16.
In his first public appearance in the 16th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and reconvert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China will not change its goals, but it will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that China&#39;s climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and pilot program support.
Progress has been made in all of these areas, including the approval last year of a new Energy Law, which recognizes the objectives being addressed with regard to the reduction of greenhouse gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with state and local governments to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans underway or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned, the Energy Efficiency Program, which has been implemented for the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change from incandescent lamps to energy-saving lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific advisor to the government of this country regarding climate change, assured that China&#39;s efforts have been greater than we think.
For example, he stated, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution in the contamination.
Likewise, it has made unprecedented efforts in energy use, how to increase energy efficiency by 20 percent in the past five years and plans to do another similar one around 2020, he said.
Espino&#39;s legal expulsion: Cesar Nava
The national leader of PAN detailed that the former panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former PAN leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
In the interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo&#39;s protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
&quot;This is a stand-alone decision of the Sonora Order Commission.&quot;
&quot;Mr. Espino has the right to address, if necessary, by making a complaint to the Commission of Order of the National Council, so that this is a decision taken within a competent body&quot;, has he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that now is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance for the presidential candidacy on the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez declared himself convinced that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections of the next December 4 and 5 where a successor should be elected.
&quot;That (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the moment, it has been an approach for local elections that has been successful and has achieved its objective&quot;, he mentioned.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is backed by 71 years of dialogue, which is why &quot;internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, &quot;we savor it and make us stronger&quot;, he said.
He said that no doubt the board will be able to elect the best leader Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would hand over &quot;to the person determined by the board.&quot;
&quot;I am completely calm and open, I would be proud to leave the office of party chairman to any of the five&quot;.
He predicted that the revival recorded by the party in the past July 4 elections will be reflected in the next dispute, even if &quot;it is not yet the time to think about 2012.&quot;
&quot;For the moment it is a question of supporting Governor Gabino Cué in this task&quot;.
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that we have made ourselves &quot;a lot of hopes for them, and I&#39;m sure Gabino will live up to expectations&quot;.
When asked about PRI&#39;s criticism of President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years in government, César Nava asked PRIists to reflect on the six years of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari .
&quot;If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón; let them start defending them; let them come out of the closet,&quot; he said.
He said that the incumbent of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Audience, because in the country there is no gag order, let alone censorship .
Obama promotes law in favor of undocumented students on Twitter
&quot;If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation&quot;, tweeted the American president in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined the National Mobilization today in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter social network account.
&quot;If you agree with approving the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation,&quot; Obama tweeted.
His short message keeps open a cybernetic link to a larger document that asks the public to contact senators immediately, as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
&quot;With a vote expected soon, now is the time to listen to your voice,&quot; he said.
The message was leaked after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block passage of any legislation if the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding continues.
Such a blockage, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax issue is resolved a schedule can be set for the rest of the projects.
&quot;I think we have a lot of time...&quot;
&quot;We all agree that this tax problem must be resolved before the end of the year...&quot;
&quot;I think we can get an agreement at some point along those lines and then we can plan the sequence for the rest,&quot; he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would seek a &quot;vote of closure of debate&quot; on the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on at from next Thursday in the Senate, although the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the Law of the American Dream would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they stayed in this country for the last five years and they were accepted by an institution of higher education or by the Army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the support of a large number of Republicans, at times when the partisan organizations of the project protagonists intense lobbying to guarantee the approval of the law.
Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
This is why supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and incumbent senator George Lemieux, from Florida, who completed the term of senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his position so far.
Even though the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act&#39;s biggest hurdles are in the Senate.
With literature we put our finger on the wound
The second stage of Les Plaisirs de la langue was a walk in which the participants displayed the narration
&quot;Sex in the language, I understand it, but... finger on the wound? what do you expect from me?&quot; asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, invited to open the second stage of The Pleasures of language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and which this time used the subtitle of its question (during another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in language, she explained).
The finger on the wound &quot;... embarrasses us&quot;, gently launched the Argentine writer to the public, mostly young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz later defined as a great story, with Luisa in first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the &quot;wound&quot; is, she goes from one doctor to another, without get an answer, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: &quot;patience is not my strong point, it is perhaps my wound&quot;.
At the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who takes her breath away in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: &quot;the wound is what is open in reality, the symbolic is the scar&quot;.
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded: &quot;on the wound I could only know that it is what is open in reality and that it does not exist&quot;, but convinced of the fact that the pleasures and the traps of the language must be very intertwined.
Valenzuela, the writer, has played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a charming narration which he entitled Praise to the invention, where the finger on the wound is not numbered but at a given moment is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, it tells of a famous sorceress who touched clouds, turned people who had gone far away, or repaired virtues that a damsel had lost, a narrative that turns to then speak America , the great news that from the beginning had its own chroniclers and quoted to Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of the narrations of the conquering capitans.
&quot;Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) laughed at the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in another way the history of America could never have been told with an imagination that even lacked modesty&quot;.
Nevertheless, he pointed out, &quot;madmen and liars have the best imagination&quot; and here the reality converges with the lie, it is unclear what part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where the literature of fiction reaches its peak.
This is in fact called the &#39;Cervantes tradition&#39;.
&quot;It is thanks to his heritage that we are what we tell&quot;.
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the invitation of the FIL with her round table The finger on the wound.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican has put hers on the great plague of social violence that her country is going through - and Latin America shares - produces disputes over the trafficking and sale of drugs.
&quot;I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated&quot;, she indicated, after quoting that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a &quot;chemical reaction&quot; of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also underlined &quot;this must be on the wound of the committed writer&quot;.
He considered that in a world which lives at high speed also in what concerns intellectual habits and the control of consciences which turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, &quot;behind each affirmation there is a small no and behind each negation there is has a small yes&quot;.
&quot;To be masters of our own feelings and to be masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times laying our finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in white and black, in established ideas and without nuance and also disturbing the powers that prefer a world in white and black&quot;, he said, inviting to recover the meaning of writing.
Romano chasing his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals he had ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find between them a marked contrast in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has been able to reach the decisive series three times, although so far he has not hit the bullseye. this is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentinian ended up consoling himself with the medal of sub-champion, he remained one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held the reins of Morelia with whom he lost with an aggregate result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in Closing 2003 also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the aggregate result of 3-1 and that was precisely against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentenary Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén again suffered a setback, as his team tied the match 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series from penalties he obtained a 3-1 advantage with two opportunities to obtain the title and finally three of his players missed from 11 meters and he suffered the jump to the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, so he doesn&#39;t want to have the same fate, he tries to get away from the curse to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, even if he asserts that for him the institution is more important.
&quot;I want to be champion, I don&#39;t want to break any statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important&quot;, commented the helmsman when asked what his weak points would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the last final, from which he assures that he learned a lot, &quot;the only lesson that we can take away is that until the referee whistles the final, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to shoot, we were already prepared to run and I think that is a lesson, before the end of the match we cannot celebrate &quot;.
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he confides in his players: &quot;We never try to reach the series of penalties, we try to finish within the regular time limit, but sometimes we only have to prepare ourselves, the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately fate has done us a bad trick, sometimes it is the emotions or the anguish of holding the title in our hands, hands it has escaped us, that served us as a lesson for this final and we hope that we do not arrive in this situation again&quot;.
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste the glory offered by the titles for the first time.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Individuals must go to the Service Centers for Visa Applicants before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost the waiting time will be reduced.
Effective January 10, 2011, visa processing procedures at US Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to report to Visa Applicant Service Centers (ASC) before their interview in the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take the applicant&#39;s biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for the aspirants, among which we mention the following:
The total cost to process the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make one payment for getting an appointment, another payment for visa processing and another for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain the same: the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars in the case of visas with request (here includes visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for visas of traders and investors.
Persons wishing to renew their visa will not have to appear for an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only present themselves at the nearest ASC where they will present the documents and have their fingerprints taken.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken in the ASC, applicants who want a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will stay there for less time than before.
Likewise, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service charge of 26 dollars.
For further information on the new visa application procedure, visit the following page http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The United States Space Agency has quoted the press to present a discovery tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 1:00 p.m. at NASA Headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe. .
When quoting the press, NASA assured that it would present &quot;that will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life&quot;, which sparked speculation from experts in other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions are improved.
There seems to be talk of a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
Either way, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that similar life might exist on other planets that don&#39;t have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, this proves that &quot;there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know&quot;.
The space agency will communicate the true significance of the findings in tomorrow&#39;s press conference, Thursday.
At the conference will participate geobiology Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn&#39;s largest satellite), from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germ PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón &#39;block&#39; opposing
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of &#39;bipartism&#39; is possible, it is denounced.
The 60th had just taken place when in the Congress appeared an opposing bloc led by the deputies of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, which declared itself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of &#39;bipartism &#39; to the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, from PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, &#39;thundered&#39; against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, we initiate &#39;bipartism&#39; because now there are two people, from the same number of parties, who control the Congress.
These four deputies, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Directory chaired by the PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that with these reforms in an institutional way political marginality is constituted on the part of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to modify the scheme starting from a political will and if they do not have it, they will again be enslaved by the two parties and in this way will end up the opposing coalition.
&quot;So far has happened (the opposing coalition), that&#39;s what I&#39;m looking at, because we&#39;re excluded, from any decision, they don&#39;t even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.&quot;
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress, after having been monopolistic, should now be &quot;duopolistic&quot;.
&quot;It is not the spirit of law reform that there should be an eternal bipartisanship in Congress.&quot;
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues so that they are more numerous, abounded the Convergent.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that the Congress has now turned into a &#39;loot&#39; between two, referring to PAN and PRI.
&quot;Before there was only one party, now they divide it into two&quot;.
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the deputy, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
&quot;That they do not leave by cupular agreements outside to 5 which will probably be 9 deputies, now to the five that we are seen, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unite to seek a place in the negotiation table , this is the problem, that in the reform that they made, that they decided, we are outside and we do not agree with this reform.
$200 million more for &quot;the supplier&quot;
The Town hall of Mazatlán pays another check to the questioned owner of the company of electrical material.
Another check for approximately 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the Town Hall.
With this, the amount paid this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in concept of &quot;liquidation of supplier account&quot;.
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Municipality would pay other amounts to this supplier, who was observed by the Superior State Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many more checks will be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
&quot;We didn&#39;t buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers,&quot; he said in an interview.
The last checks &quot;appeared&quot; in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and the latter on November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Official State Gazette, according to the provisions of the Law when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that did not use his services again.
All this, after July 25 Noroeste had published a review of the checks that the Town Council issues to its suppliers, revealing that between March 2008 - July 2010, in the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also carried out transactions with Jumapam, cashing checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be cared for
Tourism entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the roundabout Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After a foreign tourist fell into a hollow in the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, Mazatlán&#39;s tourism sector asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of Zona Dorada, recalled that they have repeatedly requested that the image of the destination be cared for and new activities must replace others that tourists find bad.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected because tourists come to walk there and they see the mess and avoid nearby businesses.
&quot;Politicians don&#39;t know what it means to close a business one day and they don&#39;t know the fortune one loses, elsewhere they weren&#39;t doing the works for so long and without proper planning.&quot;
The hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the City Council.
&quot;The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent this from happening again, how to do it, therefore through preventive maintenance and only doing the corrective&quot;, he said.
&quot;We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must we maintain it, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to maintain the city.
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
&quot;Today, because the tourist comes, it does not only depend on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions&quot;, said- he.
&quot;They weren&#39;t given the proper attention and these types of facts underline something that is common knowledge for everyone, the interview is necessary&quot;.
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be put in line together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and that it is attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
&quot;Fortunately Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that we should first order, clean up and put online to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination&quot; .
IP demands results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CCE, proposed that the deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations that it faces.
Mazatlán&#39;s business sector calls for a dignified working Legislature free of agreements between parties and the Government Executive, because Sinaloa is convulsed and faces great problems.
Yesterday the 60th legislature formed by seven political forces was installed, 19 deputies from PRI, 13 from PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM, in total 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the governmental Congress is a clean and engaged management with the society and the different sectors that need a responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CCE, proposed that the deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations that it faces.
&quot;We hope that the deputies really exercise their right, free from agreements between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to watch over their own interests and they turn into a carnival masquerade of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary fractions&quot; .
This is why I ask that they certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that make the current Governor progress.
&quot;We will ensure that they do a dignified and above all committed job with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Tres Islas Hotels, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is that of pushing and adding strength in seeking the economic growth of the State, because at present the situation economy is very complicated.
&quot;The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that in a way will stimulate the generation of jobs&quot;.
Regarding the tourist activity, he asked that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Secretariat of Government Tourism.
“I understood that it is the second Secretary of State with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as an important economic activity and generator of foreign exchange and investment and which competes directly with agribusiness”.
Apart from the fact that it is necessary to classify resources to detonating tourist projects that help to give security to the State and to update the Law of the Alcohol that the previous legislatures could not solve.
We are looking for the mage king
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Three Kings will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their household is formed by no more and no less than 12 people and a kid.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day to day because their father does not have a stable job.
&quot;Sometimes it&#39;s very difficult for us, because my husband doesn&#39;t have a job, but we sell tangerines and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with the &#39;plebs&#39; to sell in the street&quot; , says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
4-year-old Adelaida wants a doll or a bicycle, and her 3-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo has longed for a &#39;monster truck&#39; and for his 8-month-old baby brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests year-size clothes.
&quot;He told me (José Alfredo), &#39;I would like to have this monster&#39;, but I told him &#39;we&#39;ll see, my son&#39;, because he was very expensive&quot;, recalls with sadness Cayetana.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11, wears size 12; Isaías, 10, wears a size 10, while Miguel, 8, wears a size eight.
14-year-old José Juan needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can take part in the We Are Looking for the Three Kings campaign, by donating a toy or money at the Noroeste reception.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie, Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for the production of drugs.
&quot;About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used in production were seized,&quot; said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for the Sûreté du Québec.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two presumed leaders of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Those arrested were to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place following a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
&quot;It was information received from the public that allowed us to make these arrests,&quot; said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the Estrie regional investigation unit of the Sûreté du Québec, the Service de police de Sherbrooke and the Régie de police Memphrémagog, took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without any problem
The Conservatives&#39; bill which the government says would fix the problem of boats laden with illegal immigrants is clearly going to be defeated as the three opposition parties said on Wednesday they could not support it .
&quot;I rely heavily on the Charter.&quot;
&quot;I stand with a party that created the granite under your feet,&quot; Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff said as he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the bill as proposed, which would make it possible to detain anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants for up to a year, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe also said he could not support the bill because it hits the wrong target.
&quot;We are against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do,&quot; said Mr. Duceppe.
NDP immigration critic Olivia Chow has dismissed criticism that her party isn&#39;t tough enough on illegal immigrants.
&quot;New Democrats support taking action against people smugglers and that is what we are doing through another bill, Bill C-35,&quot; said Ms. Chow.
&quot;We do not support the Conservatives&#39; bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least a year,&quot; Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
&quot;Canadians are telling MPs overwhelmingly that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a doormat.&quot;
&quot;They expect Canada to take firm action,&quot; responded Minister Kenney.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to an election if it were rejected.
A Conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote so that each member who opposes then explains himself to his constituents.
The new unit is not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, maintains that this idea does not date from yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation of New York on this subject as early as last January.
The metropolis has had a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday&#39;s announcement surprised many.
It must be said that during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec police services, last October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was enough for the PQ public safety critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this announcement a “rabbit out of a hat” and a “cobbled together solution on the corner of a table”.
Minister Dutil meanwhile responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on possible future unity.
&quot;You will see the result when we announce it, he simply says.&quot;
&quot;We are aware of this problem.&quot;
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
&quot;The more Mr. Charest persists in not wanting to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide,&quot; he explains.
“The only way to have a commission of inquiry is for Jean Charest to resign,” explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he therefore suggests that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
“We must be able to broaden the mandate of the Auditor General,” he decides.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the cards of the Charest government.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to modify the Criminal Code in order to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
Federal Public Safety Minister Vic Toews has confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering certain amendments related to this file.
During the Spring 2001 operation, which hit biker groups, even if the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under close surveillance
Several rivers remain under close surveillance due to the heavy rains that have hit several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
Two houses were evacuated as a precaution.
In the evening, another landslide would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road has caved in.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, from 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
From 20 to 40 millimeters of additional rain were expected by Thursday evening, depending on the region.
Areas north of the river and in the Ottawa Valley were the hardest hit.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
As this precipitation must be added to the melting of the snow already accumulated in certain sectors, we fear the overflow of several watercourses.
Flood alert warnings were issued Wednesday evening by the Civil Security of Quebec for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers, in Lanaudière.
The Rivière du Nord, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and Rivière du Chêne, in Lotbinière, were subject to flood watches and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall caused certain lakes to overflow, in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was washed away due to heavy rain.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a precaution.
In the Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on high alert and is monitoring the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, security advisor.
The Quebec Flood Forecasting Center issued severe flood warnings on Wednesday for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L&#39;Assomption, Ouareau, L&#39;Achigan, Batiscan and du Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) for controversial remarks about social assistance and Haitians as well as his coarse language on the air.
The CBSC considers that Mr. Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that certain remarks contained &quot;inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and the foul language that is not appropriate for daytime broadcasts&quot;.
The Commission also found that a discussion of suicide, including the broadcast of the names of two people who had committed suicide, did not violate broadcasting codes.
The CBSC had received several complaints about comments made during programs broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Common Front of People on Social Assistance of Quebec.
The band complained that the amounts quoted on the show were inaccurate.
Facilitators should present solid rather than misleading information.
Regarding suicide, host Stéphane Dupont felt that suicide is a cowardly gesture.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life&#39;s problems.
&quot;The majority of the Committee considers that the implicated episodes of &quot;Dupont le midi&quot; addressed a delicate subject in a fair and appropriate manner.&quot;
No blame was therefore held against him.
The latest litigation involved statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort then engaged in a media face-to-face which had aroused many reactions.
The CHOI host said he made no donations to help Haitians because it could not be known for certain that people in need would actually receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative portrayal of Haitians.
&quot;I&#39;ve already served my three-day suspension on this.&quot;
&quot;My record has been blank for a year and a half,&quot; said the host.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of coarse language.
In each case, broadcaster CHOI-FM cooperated &quot;beyond its obligation&quot;.
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during prime time within three days.
A king of kung fu in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special career.
The athlete who excels in &quot;sanda&quot; (kung-fu &quot;full contact&quot;), kickboxing and Thai boxing takes to the mats and rings around the world in search of new challenges.
&quot;I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve among professionals.&quot;
&quot;In my case, I look for fights everywhere, since for those who don&#39;t like the ground game present in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America.&quot;
Recently, the man who works as a security guard and as a clerk for the UPS company delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship. , October 23-30, Edinburgh, Scotland.
&quot;I won the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories,&quot; he explained.
&quot;Currently, I am preparing to go to China for the San Shou World Cup.&quot;
&quot;Fighters who finished in the top four at the last world championship in each category were invited.&quot;
&quot;I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto.&quot;
&quot;In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth.&quot;
&quot;In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, while I came third in Toronto in 2009, he added.&quot;
&quot;What&#39;s interesting is that I improved with each competition.&quot;
&quot;At this rate, I will be first this time or next year!&quot;
The &quot;san shou&quot; or &quot;sanda&quot; is a discipline originating in China where punches and kicks, as well as projections on the ground, are authorized.
The duels take place originally on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most renowned pugilist to come out of this form of combat is the Vietnamese-American Cung Le, well recognized in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has to remember only one event in his career, he will certainly respond to his presence at the &quot;King of Sanda&quot; super tournament, the Super Bowl of kung fu.
&quot;This competition is the toughest and most prestigious in China, explained the friendly guy.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a bit like the Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand).&quot;
&quot;It was a great experience.&quot;
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
&quot;Whoever defeated me was a real pro, he analyzed.&quot;
&quot;There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg).&quot;
&quot;The winners of the semi-finals compete in the final of their category.&quot;
&quot;Then the winners of each category face each other in order to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu.&quot;
450 million in contracts without calls for tenders
Hydro-Québec awarded $450 million in contracts by mutual agreement to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it was a consortium made up of the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor which obtained the most important, that of the management of the project, for a sum of 295 million dollars without call for tenders.
This consortium, called Énergie gérance, was formed in 2004 at the same time as Hydro-Québec chose to entrust the private sector with its responsibility for managing this major $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Énergie gérance consortium won the lucrative contract without a public call for tenders.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing price increases.
&quot;It&#39;s the new way to collide and take down the competition.&quot;
&quot;That is to say that people, instead of doing it secretly, now do it openly,&quot; PQ MP Sylvain Simard said yesterday at a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he says it is difficult to see how the public interest can be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, vigorously denying that there was collusion for this contract.
&quot;I&#39;m starting to have my trip&quot;, she cursed, arguing that the PQ had been &quot;dishonest&quot; and had &quot;lack of rigor&quot;.
She said that &quot;it would be the least of things&quot; for the PQ to apologize.
The consortia formula is a common practice all over the world.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to combine their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project involves a high level of complexity given the scope of the work.
The work is in progress and should last until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition acting; there was negotiation.
Also, the consortia formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the consortia formula in the consulting engineering sector is the subject of a government investigation.
A quick overview of the Quebec enterprise register reveals more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
Thus, the Dessau firm works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As for the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau pointed out that &quot;the James Bay territory responds to specific labor dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has responded to them in a particular way since the 1970s&quot;.
The big boss of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d&#39;énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), gave an explanation that raised eyebrows about the fact that the project management contract was awarded by mutual agreement.
&quot;If you go to tender and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher.&quot;
&quot;You have two choices: either you take the people who are in that market and say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price.&quot;
&quot;But the idea is that it&#39;s not the price that&#39;s important, it&#39;s the skill of the people,&quot; said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, in particular soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin won 22 contracts, Génivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not to mention its participation in Énergie gérance.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the Énergie gérance contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are &quot;well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec&quot;.
Minister Normandeau dropped that the PQ is also linked to these firms which “finance” it, before specifying that it was rather its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - The &quot;green&quot; label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
Quebec consumers have very little confidence in sustainable development players, but also in fair trade brands and green certifications to guide their choices.
Worse, even if he is immersed in a media universe where messages in favor of more responsible consumption abound, he deplores a lack of credible information, a deficiency which he even describes as a brake on his commitment, indicates the Barometer of the responsible consumption, the first reading of which was delivered yesterday.
Even though they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell to them.
Two-thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Responsible Consumption Observatory of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications affixed to so-called fair trade products, but also the credibility of products and brands claiming to be eco-responsible, indicates the Barometer.
In the same vein, the discourse of politicians on this theme is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this segment of consumption currently driven by nearly a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the emptiness and dubious nature of the information would calm the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
Moreover, a third of Quebecers also say they are wary of the alleged performance of the green products or services that we are trying to put in their hands.
On another note, nearly half of consumers in 2010 changed their habits and especially changed the brand of one or more products to meet their conviction.
Up to 61%, they also favored purchases from merchants in their neighborhood and favored the purchase of food products grown in their region, indicates the Barometer.
Greener and responsible - the responsible consumption index reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present himself as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce his environmental footprint by being concerned about animal protection.
But his social and ecological conscience seems to remain outside his car, however, indicates the Barometer: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers indicated that they had used public transport or recommended carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this vast behavioral survey, which has just taken its first shot.
A State loan for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to make a financial commitment to the takeover of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to collaborate, but only up to the amount of a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and le Parallèle, which were hoping for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy back the eXcentris cinema complex on boulevard Saint-Laurent from Daniel Langlois, giving it back its full cinephilic vocation, did not obtain what they demanded.
The government agrees to get involved in the file, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is offering a loan, the amount of which would also be lower than initial expectations, which could constitute a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of sources from the pharmacies of the State.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the president of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who is leading the eXcentris dossier.
He sent her a final report about ten days ago.
But the cabinet&#39;s counter-proposal reached SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
However, it seems that the state donation hypothesis should really be ruled out.
It should be noted that the Association of Quebec Cinema and Drive-in Cinema Owners opposed direct government investment to support the takeover of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, what it did not do for other cinemas.
But several stakeholders in the community were instead calling for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of the house, has for ten years supported the auteur cinema in his premises in the complex after having financed its construction himself, which could justify an exemption from the Treasury Board.
The lack of theaters for independent films is glaring in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to retain its clientele.
Société Angus and le Parallèle, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are piloting a private fundraising campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push for the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, has continued to show films at eXcentris.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three theaters on February 27th by screening the very beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois Des hommes et des dieux.
But Christian Yaccarini did not call back Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of the lower proposals made to them.
The veil lifted on a complexed Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables disclosed by WikiLeaks lift the veil on what the United States considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians towards the Americans, but they betray at the same time the feeling of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
Thus, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter does not have Canada-US relations in mind when going to vote and believe that President Obama&#39;s visit helped the Conservative government pass its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out in the public square yesterday, offer more juicy details than substantial content to put in their mouths.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the middle of the federal election campaign, relates how the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the great astonishment of the American ambassador stationed in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
&quot;An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may be conditioning Canadian political leaders to talk about everyday domestic issues rather than focusing this election on the United States (as in the free trade campaign of 1988 ),” he wrote.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, &quot;the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about&quot;.
The ambassador understands all the less this &quot;deafening silence&quot; that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
&quot;Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going vote.&quot;
The other expression of this feeling of importance can be read in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d&#39;Affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, by which Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade due to a stimulus package of 30 to 40 billion dollars. dollars,” Mr. Breese writes.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to prorogue Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the drama series broadcast on CBC send back from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the programs Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are not very subtle references to Maher Arar, to the &quot;No-Fly-List&quot; or even to the kidnappings for muscular interrogations of the CIA.
Another cable relates that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to accept certain Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on a &quot;case by case&quot; basis.
At the end of the meeting, it is written, &quot;he gave a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin.&quot;
&quot;The secretary has agreed to review the file&quot;.
Finally, it should be noted that tempers are heating up regarding the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC radio that the person responsible for this massive leak should be &quot;assassinated&quot;.
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate lighting
The UN proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries with a view to obtaining a reduction in greenhouse gases (GHGs) that corresponds to almost a third of the additional reduction that must be achieved to stabilize the planet&#39;s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of major concrete projects that the UN hopes to have adopted in Cancún to compensate for the absence of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs which still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by compact fluorescent bulbs or, better, by light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, most of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to light humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global car fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce global emissions of GHG from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract from this assessment another 5 Gt to manage to stabilize by 2020 the rise in the climate at 2 degrees centigrade in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated as heat and the remaining 5% produces light.
With compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced by two times more.
Compact fluorescent bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, like those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy. than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the savings possible with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These brand new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emitting very little heat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several specialists have expressed reservations about compact fluorescent light bulbs since they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers in place of instructions.
But, the report says, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not CFLs, but rather coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to generate wasted electricity in incandescent light bulbs. .
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international program.
For example, Indonesia would thus save a billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tonnes of CO2, ie the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power stations, the construction of which would cost it 2.5 billion.
Côte d&#39;Ivoire nervously awaits announcement of election results
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has called for the publication &quot;without delay&quot; of the results of the presidential election in Côte d&#39;Ivoire, after the expiry of the deadlines set.
&quot;The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay,&quot; said a spokesman for the UN chief.
&quot;He asks all the Ivorian parties and the institutions to show responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the announcement of the provisional results.&quot;
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission missed Wednesday&#39;s midnight deadline without publishing the results, three days after Sunday&#39;s poll.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the president of the CEI had affirmed on television that the commission &quot;continued to work&quot; to announce the results.
Calls multiplied on Wednesday around the world for the CEI to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of &quot;fraudulent&quot; votes in the north, held by the former rebel Forces Nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N&#39;Guessan, campaign manager for the Ivorian president, said voter intimidation maneuvers by the FN in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the incumbent president from voting.
The whole election could be canceled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are upheld by the Constitutional Council.
But Gbagbo&#39;s opponents believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N&#39;Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North who denies any link with the ex-rebels, deemed the delay in announcing the results &quot;unacceptable&quot; and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim victory .
His allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from releasing the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation in a country that had been split in two for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished first in the first round on October 31 with 38% of the vote against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France as defined by the International Labor Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in mainland France (9.7% including the overseas departments), show the seasonally adjusted data ( CVS) provisional published Thursday by INSEE.
The number of unemployed stands at 2.631 million in mainland France.
The data for the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in mainland France and 9.7% with the overseas departments.
Over one year, the unemployment rate rose by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in mainland France were not working in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people on the labor market deteriorated further, with a further rise in the unemployment rate, to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points over three months, +0.5 points over one year) and 25% including the overseas departments.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed according to the ILO definition.
Seniors, for their part, experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points over three months as well as over one year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6 % with the DOMs.
Only 25-49 year olds benefited from stable unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% in the whole of France.
INSEE has not published a monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the statistics agency of the European Union, however, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including the overseas departments) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and placed in detention
Alexandre Guérini, 53, manager of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the Bouches-du-Rhône general council, was indicted and imprisoned in the Luynes remand center, near Aix- en-Provence in the context of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini has been indicted for abuse of corporate assets, embezzlement of public funds and property, concealment, active corruption, influence peddling and possession of ammunition, indicates his lawyer.
&quot;Alexandre Guérini is combative and wants to explain all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, and not fantasies.&quot;
&quot;It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible counts, it is another thing to prove them,&quot; his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before his client&#39;s hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strong man of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, held, through his lawyers, to pass to the judge before his hearing a memo in order to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also indicted on Wednesday evening and imprisoned.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his client never did anything other than operate the landfills he had to manage.
As for the attribution of the markets or the destination of the funds related to their operation, he never knew about it, said Me Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was indicted on Wednesday for embezzlement of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial supervision with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the case.
&quot;My client was able to provide explanations for the facts with which he is charged.&quot;
“The investigating magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of his freedom,” said his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four other people had been indicted and released overnight from Tuesday to Wednesday, with placement under judicial supervision for two of them, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General for Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for &quot;influence peddling and passive corruption&quot;.
Two civil servants from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are indicted, one for &quot;embezzlement and embezzlement of public property by a person in charge of a public service mission&quot;, the other for &quot;complicity embezzlement of public funds&quot;.
Finally, the companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was indicted for &quot;concealment of abuse of corporate assets&quot;.
Among the people who have been confronted with Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies of having been used to launder money from organized crime.
The investigation is carried out within the framework of several judicial inquiries opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous letters, for presumed fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions of attribution and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as from certain cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM) .
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysée has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for &quot;espionage&quot;, kept public opinion in suspense in France, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of US diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of the underside of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice for dealing with their own &quot;hostage&quot; crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman had not been offset by the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by American justice for trafficking in materials for the benefit Iran&#39;s nuclear program.
Finally, they cast a harsh light on how the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, it did not happen.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is titled &quot;Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage cases&quot;.
The adviser to the Elysée for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d&#39;Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise the Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals detained by force in Iran.
&quot;Make noise&quot;, they say, &quot;constantly hammer&quot; in the media the words &quot;fundamental human rights&quot;, &quot;innocence&quot;, &quot;immediate release&quot;.
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
&quot;Do it especially since the Iranians are asking you not to do it.&quot;
Because, past the attempts at discussions through discreet channels, &quot;silence will not solve anything&quot;, the Iranians are &quot;masters in delaying maneuvers&quot;.
Mr Richier adds that arresting foreigners is &quot;a familiar Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail&quot;.
He announces that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day she takes refuge in the French Embassy) &quot;will require the payment to the Iranians of a large sum of money&quot; (230,000 euros in bail ).
And he says that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon which &quot;will get worse&quot;.
The Iranians could &quot;in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran&quot;, he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for twelve days, but remains stuck in Iran.
Information is released: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is demanding for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, by decision of a judge.
The US Embassy, like many observers, wonders about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks Iranian clandestine networks for the acquisition of material intended for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France agreed to a bargain?
The release of the Iranian against that of the French?
During a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier assures us that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only &quot;taken completely by surprise by the judge&#39;s decision&quot;, but sought to oppose it.
&quot;There were lively exchanges between the French presidency and the Keeper of the Seals&quot; (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but &quot;the French government cannot reverse the judicial decision&quot;, he observes .
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the &quot;close&quot; surveillance of the French intelligence services.
The adviser to the Elysée dials a telephone number, hangs up, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian &quot;is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy&quot;.
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée spared no effort, by means of press releases and &quot;leaks&quot; organized in the media, to make believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an &quot;important&quot; role and &quot;influencer&quot; from &quot;mediator&quot;.
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and note that the manipulation bears fruit since several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 evokes &quot;the media &#39;blitz&#39; of French officials&quot;.
On what is based so much &quot;gratitude&quot; expressed towards Mr. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
&quot;Despite their laudatory statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done.&quot;
The document then looks at the reasons that led the Elysée to pay into this fiction.
The intense communication effort &quot;aims to validate Sarkozy&#39;s policy of openness to Syria&quot;, he analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008, which “had then been perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and undeserved”.
By &quot;exaggerating the Syrian role&quot;, Paris seeks to &quot;demonstrate to Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region&quot;.
The objective is also to &quot;sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran&quot;.
The American embassy knows it from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: &quot;Of course, we don&#39;t know if the Syrians did anything.&quot;
&quot;But we thanked them anyway.&quot;
&quot;This should at least confuse Iranians.&quot;
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysée.
In a press release, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their &quot;active role in favor of the release of our compatriot&quot;.
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a so-called &quot;Cinderella law&quot; that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to require online gambling companies to block access to these games after midnight for young people under the age of 16, representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
&quot;A lot of children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying in school and having a normal life during the day.&quot;
&quot;We believe that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep,&quot; Jo Rin, the ministerial official in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have a year to prepare for enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also provide people who request it with free software that allows them to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most &quot;connected&quot; countries and the newspapers regularly report miscellaneous facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, beating 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World Cup: FIFA designates host countries
In the midst of turmoil due to suspicions of corruption, the executive committee of Fifa designates on Thursday the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, an eminently political choice where the struggles for influence and lobbying risk taking precedence over the criteria techniques.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of FIFA&#39;s premier competition will take place in Europe, the discipline&#39;s traditional stronghold (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
That of 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea South).
The list of personalities forming part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political stakes of a World Cup.
The negotiations behind the scenes are therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavily for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, at the origin of the revelations which led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football which did not host the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC gave a layer, Monday, by broadcasting a documentary which pinpoints three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to displease Fifa and embarrass English officials, who have embarked on intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron in the front line.
The head of government hopes to repeat the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who in 2005 obtained the organization of the 2012 Olympics for London.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore the image of England with the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the Spain-Portugal duo does not lack assets with its stadiums already ready, its expertise (World-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the gloomy economic and financial prospects of the two countries could shower their ambitions.
Possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, which has become a serious outsider despite the shortcomings of its file (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced &quot;unfair competition in the preparation of the vote&quot;, in a barely veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
&quot;We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them,&quot; said Mr. Putin.
For 2022, the United States, on the strength of the experience of 1994, appear as the logical favourites.
First world economic power, seat of the main sponsors of Fifa, the country seems to have a head start on Japan and South Korea, which have separately built a very beautiful project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organized the event in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the World Cup-2026 to China, ardently desired by Fifa, which would in fact nullify the Asian chances for 2022.
With Qatar, which pulled out the big game by offering futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue its expansion into new countries, but these two countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the low TV rights paid (due to the time difference) by European countries, the sinews of war for Fifa.
Second term: the evidence
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had pretended he was hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d&#39;Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation whatsoever.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
A mandate at the Elysée calls for another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not mix well with the part of mystery attached to the presidential office.
So we have to act as if the doubt still existed.
One way or the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, the friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third mandate was not excluded.
November 15, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy ensured that he would make his decision &quot;somewhere in the fall of 2011&quot;.
He evokes in front of UMP parliamentarians, Tuesday evening at the Elysee Palace, the prospect of &quot;two terms&quot; has therefore sown a little excitement.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far from it.
The president was only recalling that the constitutional revision of 2008 limited the number of five-year terms to two.
He was making a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time that he has mentioned the presidential election, in a humorous tone, during such meetings.
&quot;At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me,&quot; he told them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: &quot;Don&#39;t think I&#39;m not thinking about the next step.&quot;
His remarks the day before yesterday do not make him any more of a candidate than the day before; they don&#39;t make it any less.
If they arouse comments, it is for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But it is not the entry into the running of Ségolène Royal which pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many at the PS are calling for a battle order to be put in order earlier than expected.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L&#39;Express).
&quot;We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on this,&quot; reacted immediately and cautiously the entourage of the Prime Minister.
&quot;If he believes defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate,&quot; says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
&quot;He will always believe he can win,&quot; corrects Alain Juppé, obviously resigned.
Euro: the ECB forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to be the occasion to specify the methods of ending the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of a good number of operations unconventional monetary policy agreements which are due to end at the end of the year.
Due to the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt Issuing Institute will probably not be able to afford to be so peremptory at the risk of aggravating a situation that is more than tense today on the European bond markets.
The political cost would be all the higher.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, thus hailed the active role played by the ECB in favor of the resolution of the debt crisis of the States in Europe.
She did not wish to say if she believed that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its program of purchases of sovereign bonds.
&quot;I reserve my thoughts for my European partners (...)&quot;.
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more forthcoming as to his intentions, contenting himself with indicate that the program of purchase of government securities on the secondary market &quot;continues&quot; and that &quot;we will see what we decide&quot; at the meeting on Thursday.
The only certainty: the ECB will keep its main key rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of Treasury bonds by the ECB doubled last week, to nearly 1.35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have bought 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among market operators, expectations of continued buying are clear (see page 29).
Economists are not expecting any significant change in direction either.
While loan operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB&#39;s arsenal, the latter still proceeds with unlimited liquidity allocations under generous conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this device to be extended for a few months.
&quot;I can&#39;t imagine her changing her program significantly.&quot;
&quot;Otherwise it would be taking the risk of causing new tensions in the short term,&quot; said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
“A gradual exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,” anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the public debt market, &quot;the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of these bonds to animate a sluggish market&quot;, adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks&#39; exposure to sovereign debt markets in the euro zone, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
&quot;It must at all costs substitute for the lack of investors on the market and act in such a way as to prevent a surge in returns paid by the most fragile States&quot;, testified a major bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates soar, States will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
Safeguarding the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is turning its back
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation eased a little yesterday, with the decline in 10-year bond rates.
A return to precarious calm.
After a meeting with the Minister of the Economy, the regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as &quot;indecipherable&quot; and expect an &quot;unpredictable&quot; weekend, which the person concerned then denied.
On Tuesday in any case, the spread with German long-term rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of hedging contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had soared to 263 points, causing some panic at Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain, the gap with German rates was greater than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was &quot;strongly concerned&quot; by &quot;turbulent markets&quot; and possible contagion from Ireland.
&quot;The good news is that Italy, the eurozone&#39;s third-largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.&quot;
&quot;The bad news is that it&#39;s like Portugal,&quot; says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the sluggishness of tax revenues that goes with it, making the state run the risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012...while the budget currently being examined in the Senate expects 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, calculates the European Commission, the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (against 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7% ).
Hence the rumor of a new collective budget which could be put in place after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
&quot;If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken,&quot; said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
&quot;The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been repeating this for a long time&quot;, assures Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
&quot;There is no immediate problem, neither in the short nor in the long term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, editor&#39;s note), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are less than those required of other countries&quot;, observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
There remains the question of political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, following which early elections could be organized at the end of March.
A period not conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis would then begin.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis systems
Christine Lagarde hammered it home again yesterday at a press conference in Paris: &quot;The Europeans, I believe we demonstrated this again on Sunday during the day and at night, are obviously united, determined, committed to defend their currency and their monetary zone.&quot;
Although quite relative, the easing recorded yesterday on European government bond rates provided grist for the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet speak of a beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s has announced that it could downgrade Portugal&#39;s debt rating, the most speculative target today.
&quot;As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs in particular on the banking systems&quot;, estimate the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since &quot;political time is much slower than market time&quot;.
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it conceals, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen the already existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are well underway.
And this also in view of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of unconventional support measures for eurozone countries in the crosshairs of the markets (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia on Tuesday in Singapore to inform Far Eastern investors of developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the objective of these visits is not to raise funds, he certainly prepares the ground for it.
The first issues of EFSF securities are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, a US official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by additional direct engagement from the IMF.
The countries that are on the front line, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in terms of the organization of the labor market.
Reforms which are added to the austerity measures with closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from those of Greece and Ireland.
Both are keen at all costs to avoid asking for international aid before implementing their own budgetary corrective measures and deciding on the structural reforms essential to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to accelerate the process of normalization of sovereign bond markets.
Passing through Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to put forward the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to put your hand back in your wallet.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of around 100 billion euros would be sufficient, &quot;preferably&quot; in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism endowed, to date, with 60 billion euros.
Advice that is likely to be carefully considered in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
Snowy episodes still cause traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and risk disrupting certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already on orange alert, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, sustained snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it is snowing lightly in Ile-de-France.
Layers of snow ranging from 2 to 5 cm, occasionally from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d&#39;Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
The snowy episodes are significant enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d&#39;Armor, several departmental roads have been prohibited for heavy goods vehicles over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend taking your vehicle only if necessary and the circulation of certain TER coaches has been suspended for the day.
School transport was banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measure was envisaged Wednesday evening to restrict the circulation of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture &quot;invites all motorists to exercise the greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly&quot;.
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel Thursday 25% of their flights at Paris Roissy airport and 10% at Orly due to the upcoming snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick airport, south of London, and that of Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the time that the debate around the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France has been in full swing, billions have been raining down.
In discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion is mentioned for the Grand Paris metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the State announced a capital endowment of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical diagram, it is this sum which will then allow the SGP to borrow on the markets a part of the financing of its double loop.
Today, we finally come to the first additions.
The amending finance law for 2010, examined by the finance committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the mechanisms provided for finding the start of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, we read in the text of the bill, article 15, is &quot;for the benefit of the public establishment Société du Grand Paris&quot;.
It is quantified: &quot;The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year&quot;.
The second is a reorganization of a tax on offices which already exists &quot;in order to modernize it, to increase the product and to allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris&quot;.
How much would that pay?
Mystery.
It&#39;s not encrypted in the text.
We are far from 4 billion.
&quot;It is specified that these tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the capital endowment which will be mobilized by the State and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses&quot;, can we read in the explanatory memorandum.
At the SGP, we do not find this system shocking.
&quot;From the moment we create revenue (the two taxes, editor&#39;s note), we can cover the studies over three years and then type in the 4 billion afterwards, we explain there.&quot;
&quot;It will be budgeted and drawn as it goes.&quot;
The SGP estimates that the 4 billion will begin to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the 4 billion promised are still absent subscribers, risks provoking a somewhat agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on December 7.
Vengeful hackers and stagecoach spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a double value.
On the one hand, it turns out to be an apparent scandal, a scandal that only appears as a scandal when faced with the hypocrisy that governs the relationship between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let&#39;s go in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file compiled by a secret service (of whatever nation) is composed exclusively of press clippings.
The &quot;extraordinary&quot; American revelations about Berlusconi&#39;s sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those owned by Berlusconi), and the grimly cartoonish profile of Gaddafi had long been for cabaret artists matter for sketches.
The rule that secret files should only consist of previously known news is essential to the dynamics of the secret service, and not just in this century.
If you go to a bookstore devoted to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in previous works. .
And this not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do new research (nor does he know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to the occult only believe in what they already know, and which reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown&#39;s success.
Ditto for the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited-minded) the head of the secret services (otherwise he could be, what do I know, an editor at Liberation), who only accepts as true what he recognizes.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the US Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same that Newsweek published the week before.
So why have the revelations about these files caused so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since Heads of State can telephone each other or take a plane to meet at dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, apart from a few small exercises of representation, have been transformed into centers of espionage.
Any spectator of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only out of hypocrisy that we pretend to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to cast a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that some hacker could capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world deals a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
So the scandal does not put the victims in crisis so much as the &quot;executioners&quot;.
But let&#39;s come to the deeper nature of what happened.
Formerly, at the time of Orwell, one could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been completely proven since, being able to control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction carried out, the hotel visited, the highway taken and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as is happening now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the relationship of control ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen&#39;s avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold on?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said it, that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is effectively an empty secret, because it is in the public domain; but revealing, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton&#39;s secrets were empty secrets means taking away all power from her.
WikiLeaks did no wrong to Sarkozy or Merkel, but did too much to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, the States will no longer be able to put any reserved information online - that would be like publishing it on a poster stuck on the corner of the street.
But it is just as obvious that with current technologies, it is vain to hope to be able to maintain confidential relations by telephone.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state traveled by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved relationships be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the moment, my forecast is science fiction and therefore fictional, but I am forced to imagine government agents moving discreetly in stagecoaches with uncontrollable routes, in no only carrying messages learned by heart or, at most, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept in a single copy in locked drawers: basically, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now advancing like a crab, that is to say backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has reestablished a wired (telephone) telegraph.
Videocassettes (analog) had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going back and forth and discovering all the secrets of editing, whereas now CDs (digital) only allow skipping from chapter to chapter, that is to say by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, you can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the trips it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that politics and the techniques of communications should revert to horse-drawn carriages.
One last observation.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was going on in the secrecy of the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that request confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France tweaks its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to examine compliance with the promises of rapidly released funding (known as fast start or early stage funding) made by developed countries.
And the big French hacks are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years and France 1.26 billion euros (420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU pulled out all the stops to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start funding: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, major side event , distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation is appreciable and appreciated at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, which puts it on the right track to meet its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when we look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, &quot;new and additional&quot;, in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of Official Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what &quot;new and additional&quot; means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonization, some Member States including France blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
The European Commission, for example, has considered 2009 as a benchmark: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years for fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks in terms of year or in terms of level of official development assistance.
On the other hand, France considers that the financing of &quot;all new projects&quot; for the year 2010 are &quot;new and additional&quot;.
In other words, there is no reference to spending in previous years or to the overall level of Official Development Assistance.
Concretely, the total amount of France&#39;s support to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment in terms of &quot;new and additional&quot; financing...
Another crucial element is the distribution between grants and loans.
Here again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that 1€ lent is equivalent to 1€ given.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions that rely on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro that we will recover as equivalent to one euro that is given... At most, only the cost of the loan for the lending country (ie the equivalent of an interest rate) should be counted as part of its commitments.
But France has no use for such reasoning: it &quot;respects&quot; its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts 1€ to meet its commitment, France only puts 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice trick!
In summary, in its fast start financing, France operates a double swindle: on the one hand on the evolution of the action over time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only 36.1 million euros, it manages to believe that it is spending 420 million &quot;new and additional&quot; in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why the other Member States would continue to give it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely fooled...
The early stage financing chapter is only a small, relatively short-term issue in relation to the whole climate discussion.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let&#39;s hope that won&#39;t be the case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn the lessons of this first year of fast-start funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its method of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance discussions on the issues of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently being discussed): we will not escape the question of &quot;additionality&quot; or the method of accounting for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
Hope therefore rests with the new Minister of the Environment, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on France&#39;s fast start and on its vision of &quot;additionality&quot; and the use of loans would be likely to increase the level of international confidence necessary to move forward in the discussions.
Pesticides ingested by children alert
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemical substances in one day, according to a study published on Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (formerly Movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results &quot;have no significant statistical value in view of the small number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with&quot;, bought between July and September the foods generally consumed in four meals and a snack in one day by a child of about ten years old, in the supermarkets of Oise and Paris.
These typical meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day - as well as treats, have been examined by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, metals heavy and other pollutants.
The assessment of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as certain carcinogens as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies by several institutions such as the Center international cancer research community.
&quot;Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical substance taken individually are not exceeded, we can clearly see in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to possibly carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is worrying. “, notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than ten possible carcinogenic residues and three proven to be certain carcinogens as well as nearly twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, provided as a snack by the study, has traces of six chemical substances including a fungicide yet banned in France.
The same goes for the green beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the ground beef, the canned tuna, and even the baguette and chewing gum were loaded with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyzes revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the &quot;richest&quot; with 34 chemical residues detected and even examination of the plastic plate used to reheat the meal in the microwave was not exempt.
The final risk to the consumer of this &quot;contaminant cocktails&quot; &quot;is probably underestimated&quot;, according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, proposed &quot;given the urgency of the situation&quot; to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop &quot;the increase in diseases of civilization&quot;.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
