Good evening!
Our planet is covered with 70% of the ocean, and yet, strangely, we chose to call it "the Earth".
The poet Heathcote Williams has a much more objective and less anthropocentric vision, when he says that "View of space, the planet is blue.
View of space, it is the territory, not of men, but of whales.”
And yet, we all come from the ocean.
It's the cradle of life, even though we forgot about it.
The ocean is everywhere: in glaciers, rivers, groundwater, in the cells of living things, and in our veins.
Strangely, it was John Fitzgerald Kennedy who illustrated it quite well, in this quote: "It is an interesting biological fact that everyone has in the veins an equal percentage of salt in the blood, to that which exists in the oceans.
So we all have salt in our blood, our sweat, our tears.
We are connected to the ocean, and when we return to the sea, whether to sail, or to look at it, we return to where we came from. »
And yet, this ocean, we know very, very badly.
It's still a pretty strange and alien world, which sometimes scares.
That said, in fact, it is far from being an inert body of water, a body of water that is useless.
In fact, it is marine life that makes this ocean a major climate regulator, the main carbon sink, and also, the main oxygen producer.
Between 50 and 70% of oxygen comes from the ocean.
So, in fact, more than one in two inspirations you take, you owe it to the ocean.
Not quite in the ocean!
In fact, you owe it to marine life.
Marine life is it that allows this mass of water, precisely, not to be just a mass of inert water, but to be this machinery that allows us to live.
And, marine life starts from the phytoplankton which supplies oxygen, to the great whales, through the great predators, tuna, dolphins... And among these species, there are some that are ecologically more important than others, especially sharks.
So, this is the example I chose because it's an animal that we tend to demonize, a sea monster.
And yet, every year, 70 million sharks are slaughtered.
It's like we're exterminating the equivalent of France.
Sharks are records of evolution.
They are 470 million years old.
This means concretely that, for 470 million years, all life in the ocean has been shaped by, and according to sharks.
And as a predatory “top”, keystone species, when you remove sharks from an ecosystem, you have a collapse of marine biodiversity.
So, where the sharks are gone, we have dead waters, or we have jellyfish explosions, but we have no life.
Here you go!
That's the role of predators.
We, as humans, tend to consider ourselves the “top” predators.
And yet, we are far from predators, since, in Nature, predators are, on the one hand, regulated by the availability of their prey - but this is no longer the case for us since we invented agriculture and livestock - on the other hand, predators tend to reproduce less.
So, cheetahs or lions are going to have far fewer small ones than mice or rabbits.
Mice and rabbits are prey, naturally, so they need to reproduce very quickly, and in very large numbers.
Sharks, whales, dolphins, are predators.
They were not designed to be prey.
We made them prey!
So they can't, in fact, survive the predatory pressure of man.
There is also a common point in all these marine animals, whether predatory or not.
It is because they all participate in marine life, that is, a life cycle, unlike us.
To give you an example of blue whales, a blue whale produces, every day, 3 tons of excrement - excrement that is very rich in nitrogen or nitrogen - and that is the essential nutrients for phytoplankton that provides us with the oxygen we breathe.
In fact, 40% of the phytoplankton population has been lost over the past 50 years, largely because whales were exterminated in the 20th century and before, but even more so with the invention of the explosive harpoon.
The man goes to sea.
It is not part of this ecosystem.
We haven't been part of it since we left the ocean.
So we are an intruder.
We are an intruder with means of fishing, predation, which are, today, industrialized.
And we are a predator who no longer has the natural limits of predators.
So, we are more than 7 billion, and today, 7 billion people want to eat fish.
So this is a big problem.
The other problem is this illusion that we have had for a long time, and that we may still have, but less and less, than in fact, marine life is unlimited.
Jules Michelet, who wrote a fairly well-known book, which is a reference in the matter, illustrates it quite well: "At certain narrow passages, one cannot row, the sea is solid.
Millions of millions, billions of billions who will dare to venture to guess the number of these legions.
It is said that once, near Le Havre, only one fisherman found an 804 million.
In a port in Scotland, 11 000 barrels were made in one night. »
When we read the historical testimonies, we are told that off the west Atlantic coast, French, we saw whales pass for days, the boats had to stop.
Those near the coast, did not sleep, sometimes, as the breath of the whales made noise.
Today, when you see a wing, you are amazed.
We lost our memory of what the sea was before we started fishing.
This is also a quote from Thomas Huxley that illustrates well the lack of knowledge and the denial in which we were: “Nothing we do can affect the number of fish. »
And yet, today, 90% of the great fish in the ocean have already been exterminated.
The problem is that it is difficult to have empathy for fish.
It's already hard to save the whales.
Whales are charismatic animals with big sympathy.
Yet today, in 2016, they continue to die under explosive harpoon blows, despite the moratoriums, despite the sanctuaries.
It is also one of the main fights of Sea Shepherd because we consider that if we can not save the whales, it will be very complicated to save anything else in the ocean, much less the sharks that we consider monsters, or tuna, which do not interest us.
Fish are so deconsidered, that we refer to them in terms of tons.
So we will talk about 13 000 tonnes of quotas, 13 000 tonnes of tuna, or 15 000 tonnes of sharks.
It would shock you if I talked about tons of giraffes, or tons of dogs, or tons of... French!
Fish are not even considered individuals.
It is simply a mass that is part of a stock, which it may be necessary to preserve, in order to make the most of a sustainable exploitation.
Then!
We can ask ourselves, tell ourselves that, finally, if the fish disappear, if the ocean goes wrong, anyway, we, we're fine.
There are many of us.
We're everywhere.
However, we must be wary because there are misleading signs.
In reality, the above-extingity of a species is several factors, including these three, which are the main: the population explosion, the overexploitation of resources, and the occupation of all ecological niches, that is to say the fact of spreading everywhere.
Maybe it reminds you of someone...
In fact, if you’re looking for an example of an endangered species, there’s no need to search on Google, you look in a mirror, or you look at your neighbor.
So we're not doing that well!
Today, we are talking about sustainable fishing.
And yet, United Nations scientists predict a collapse of fisheries by 2048.
2048 is 32 years, so it's... tomorrow morning.
What does a collapse of the fisheries mean?
That means more fish.
It doesn't just mean that on the menu, you won't have fish or when you go into the fishmongers, they'll be empty, it means the death of the ocean.
Because as I explained earlier, before being a food source for anyone, fish, like marine life, are the essential working force that allows the ocean, precisely, to be that extraordinary machinery that allows us to live.
Imagine you have to go from more than one breath out of two.
Imagine that all this carbon dioxide that is captured in the ocean, which is even more important than what is captured by the forests, is found in the atmosphere.
In fact, it would be the end of human civilization.
Then...
Basically, I gave you reasons, I gave you very down-to-earth reasons, we'll say, for which to defend the ocean.
Finally, the solution is quite simple, for us, for everyone.
If you do not directly depend on fish to live, it is best to refrain from eating them.
Seven billion people will never be able to eat fish.
We'll actually exterminate marine life.
So that's when you think utilitarianly, because leitmotiv is that: if the ocean dies, we will die.
So, if we want to live, and we want our children to be able to live after us, we will have to take radical measures, and change our lifestyles, to "adapt".
That is the key word of evolution and species that want to survive.
As Darwin told us, adapt or die.
So we're gonna have to adapt, and adapt quickly.
But, personally, what motivates me, in all this, and what makes me there, in front of you, tonight, is not so much this question of survival, utilitarian, praiseable, but utilitarian.
In fact, it is rather... this difficulty that I have to live with this injustice that is inflicted, in fact, on all that is weaker than us, and I find that it is morally and ethically, the engine that pushes me - an injustice that is very well described by Milan Kundera, in this quote extracted from "The Unsustainable lightness of being": "The true goodness of man can be manifested in allForce.
The true moral test of humanity - the most radical, which is on such a deep level that it escapes our gaze - is its relations with those who are at its mercy: animals.
And this is where the fundamental bankruptcy of man has occurred, so fundamental that all the others result from it... » Thank you!
(Applause)
My daily life is made of sensations that most of you do not know.
For a long time, I was ashamed of it.
I remember very well the circumstances in which I discovered this difference.
I was 4 years old and I wanted to express to my mother the joy that I felt when looking at the sun through a leaf and I spoke to her not about the leaf as such, but about the colors and sensations that were caused by what I had felt when I saw the leaf: these yellow and green lines, this very particular taste, halfway between sugar, mint, cucumber, which came to me following, joy like a shimmering water... She just thought I was crazy.
And then, so, I hid it and growing it up, I was frustrated to keep those perceptions that seem very beautiful to me and I tried to represent them in this painting that you see.
Immediately, thinking about these emotions, I also found the ones I had felt while listening to this music, the Va Pensiero de Verdi.
(Music) Synesthesia is not a disease, it is just a different perception of things that conducts senses that normally are not connected to each other to enter into a relationship.
For example, you hear the music note mi, and you see it blue or green.
You taste an apple and the taste of this apple will you evoke a geometric shape.
It's innate and it's involuntary.
There are a multitude of different synesthesias, this would concern according to evaluations discussed about one in 2000 people; discussed because most synesthetes do not know how to be synesthetes until they discover the existence of the phenomenon.
Thanks to my synesthesia, my emotions, my thoughts, my associations of ideas, as you could see, my little inner voice, everything appears to me in the form of colors, shapes, tastes, movements.
It enriches the perception of the world and the paintings I try to make to represent all this are about as faithful in relation to the original perception as a stop on images compared to a 3-hour film or a photo of chocolate cake compared to a real chocolate cake.
But it is much more speaking than words.
Words say nothing about the world and that's what I tried to paint in this painting: at the bottom on the left, you have the real, the emotions it inspires me, the thoughts, above, the imagination; at the crossroads of imagination and reality, voice.
And little by little, you have this narrowing by going to the right, when it is necessary to pass all this inner wealth into this tiny impasse, the words.
Throughout my childhood, I thought why we hadn't invented specific words to say all this wealth?
Why didn't we invent a specific word to talk about the joy we feel when we look at the sunlight in a leaf?
Why didn't we invent another different word to say the joy we feel when we see our child again, when we see our spouse?
But it has nothing to do with it.
Probably because it was not considered useful and in fact, recent research on synesthesia would tend to show that we would all have, every child, these nerve affairs in addition, which explain synesthesia.
But we lose them little by little.
There is no fatality to that, words are a framework, it has a convention that allows us to communicate, now, nothing forbids us to preserve the richness of our perception.
Yet we do not, we lock ourselves in the context of words, we narrow our perception of the world to these words when nothing obliges us to do, probably because we think that this is what others expect of us.
In antiquity, studies on ancient languages have shown that colors have been perceived in a very particular order: first black, white, red, green or yellow, and finally blue.
So this sea you see blue, the Greeks in antiquity saw it purple, for example.
Conversely, where you see snow, a Scotsman will be able to think of one of the 421 words used in his language to speak snow.
Obviously, it has an impact on the way the world sees, which we perceive, it is probably this change of scenery that we are looking for by going to the other end of the planet to discover new landscapes, certainly, but also new ways of seeing, of perceiving.
And very curiously, no one makes this journey that can be just as fascinating, which is simply to ask his neighbor or neighbor: “Your perception of the world, your little inner voice, what do they tell you? »
If I take you on a journey through my synesthesia, you will enter a world where using the same word remains the best guarantee of not understanding each other.
When I worked in financial diplomacy about 13 to 14 years ago, there was a very fashionable term, it was "sound policy", "sound policies" that was used to refer to the policies that a country had to put in place to benefit from aid or debt reduction.
In the UN vision, “sound policies” was a comprehensive respect for human rights and not too much corruption.
For the IMF, it was balanced budget, period.
For the World Bank, this is the vision of the United Nations, that of the IMF, and then other things, of investment in economic development in the broadest sense, agriculture, urbanization, transport.
Now, these three international organizations, you put them at the same table, on the same text, using that same word, visually, you see right away that the misunderstandings are going to be many.
You may be able to grasp the beauty of diplomatic language of giving the illusion of an agreement where there is not necessarily something to move forward, but you will also understand why there is then a whole bureaucracy needed to manage what happens next.
Entering my synesthesia also means apprehending an environment where thoughts and emotions appear at the same time as a satellite map and at the microscope level.
I represented in this painting the vision that comes to me when I think, in a novel that I am writing, to the meeting between the main character, Arthur, and his friend Bérénice, at a time when Berenice has hurt herself, the way they will fall in love and then lose sight of each other.
Behind this overall vision, you have plenty of more microscope visions that correspond to details of the chapter, character elements of the characters.
For example, the board on your left refers to and illustrates how Arthur sees the character of Berenice.
A joyful young girl who is full of hope but also presents incomprehensible dark ideas.
If I vary the circumstances of their encounter, if they meet at the beach, if the character of Arthur is different, if Berenice loses his dark ideas, immediately, the vision that I will have of the chapter will change, both at the satellite level and at the microscope level.
You're probably wondering what it's like to be a synesthete?
This is a difficult question insofar as it is something that we do not master, we are born with.
But we can play it and have fun with it.
Personally, I find that it is a great wealth to always be at the border between two frameworks: the synaesthetic one in which I think and that of the words in which I try to communicate today.
Playing on the frames means, for example, not brainstorming at the level of words but at the level of perceptions and sensations that precede these words.
I am willing to bet that the creators of the Cleopatra glue, some of which here may remember, have thought much more about the smell of almond of this glue than its glue properties as such.
Playing frames is also not feeling constrained by the way others will receive your message.
Thus, I wanted to write a poem and make a painting that illustrated the synaesthetic vision that had given rise to this poem.
I told a publisher who told me that he was not interested, that the important thing was the text, the painting was totally mocked.
I told a gallery owner who had the opposite reaction: painting, it's the most important, the text we don't care.
And then well, after a first moment of discouragement, I thought that the most important was the message: what was the form, what was the mode of expression that was adequate for this message?
So, if I try to make a poem to express the emotion that my synesthesia gives me on a daily basis, it could look like this: the dismasted fire in the fury of sounds, fat like a sun, the almond of the real with orphaned constellations dazzles the interline thought of non-existed vertigo.
This is the poem that fits the picture you have before your eyes.
For me, the two are connected and inseparable.
Now, poetry lovers will be more sensitive to poems or not, paint lovers will be more sensitive to painting or not, but ultimately, whatever, because here stops the adventure of my perception and here begins yours.
(Applause)
Hello.
Do you know what I do every day when I walk in Paris?
I can't help it.
I open the trash and look at what's in it.
At first, it was shame for my children.
Now I'm very happy because they're doing the same as I do.
So, from the trash can, I take out bottles, bottles, cans, cans and a lot of boxes every day.
These materials are recyclable materials.
They have nothing to do in this trash.
Nothing at all.
And yet, they are there.
To sort, it takes three seconds.
One, two, three.
Three seconds.
It is not long and yet, multiplied by 65 million inhabitants every day, it is huge for the environment.
Huge.
So these three seconds, when do we need it?
We need it when we're having lunch.
We need it when we've had dinner.
We need it when we get rid of it, we ask ourselves the question: do I throw or do I sort?
Do I lose or do I win?
So, what do we lose and what do we gain?
We lose a lot, all of you, when you don't sort.
Because these recyclable materials are spoiled.
They will either be burned or buried in landfills.
And we're not going to tell each other a story: when they're in landfills, there's a little bit of them going to go into the forests, the countryside and the sea.
When we all sort, we win a lot.
A lot.
A can that is sorted, it will first be transported, sorted, collected, transformed, pampered, and it will become again a can or a bike, a car, a whole series of objects.
And it's the same for glass, it's the same for plastic, bottles, cans, and it's the same for cardboard.
All these materials, if they are put in the right tank, [will] be able to be reused.
We can all sort, all sort, down from home or next to our home.
All.
And it takes 3 seconds.
This ability to sort, this ability that we have not to pollute, it is simple.
And we owe it to two men.
Two men who in the 90's changed the game.
Remember the landfills at the time.
There were them everywhere, it overflowed and we could not manage the environmental impact of consumption.
And these two men decided to trust each other.
Instead of having the classic reflex to say: “Go we create a tax! »
and then we're going to create an administration, there's going to be an administration that's dealing with it.
And then we forget the subject.
These two men, Brice Lalonde, Minister of Ecology in 1992 and Antoine Riboud, patron of Danone, they decide to do otherwise.
While few people talked about ecology in 1992, they say, “Here, we’re going to start a private company, a non-profit company, but it will be private.
And it will make 100% of general interest.
100% private, 100% dedicated to the general interest to focus on this topic.
So she's going to recruit and she's going to make sure to attract other companies. »
Another 50 000 consumer companies joined forces and they worked with local authorities.
An incredible invention, and the public afterwards, it was actually going to do the collection, sorting and recycling.
The private company Eco-Emballages was going to be pilot of the device and the state would control and give the objectives.
At that moment, it creates a dynamic.
Companies, brands, associations, local authorities, municipalities, waste operators and recyclers, while they all have a radically different culture, come together and say to themselves: "Come on, let's go. »
And the yellow bin settles everywhere, or almost and the sorting begins.
Today, we are in a very efficient system.
In fact, the company Eco-Emballages operates in a simple way.
A company that sells a packaged product, it will pay a lot if the packaging is heavy.
If the packaging is lightweight, eco-designed, it will pay less.
Afterwards, Eco-Packaging finances the whole.
650 million euros are invested each year in sorting, collection and recycling.
So today, I'm also here to tell you that we're having trouble.
In fact, in recent years, the collection has not progressed.
She's stable.
And I have two stones in my shoe.
The first is the city.
In the city, we recycle half as much as in the countryside.
We recycle in the city at only 30%.
It wants when in this room, there's only one in three sorters.
And bad news, in a few years, in less than ten years, we will be 85% to live in the city.
The second rock in the shoe I have is plastic.
In 1950, 1.5 million tonnes of plastic were produced.
Today we produce 350 million.
In a while, 750 million tonnes of plastic will be produced.
And the problem is that plastic is only recycled at 23%.
If we don't sort the plastic, it becomes that.
Plastic should be sorted because the seventh continent exists.
The seventh continent, it is in the sea, it is plastic particles that, little by little, run down and will create the largest landfill in the world.
There's an alternative to that.
If we ever make this gesture, if we ever take this bottle, and everything else and put it in this bin and use it, then, what happens?
This is happening.
This is plastic that can make a bottle again.
It is plastic that is made without oil, it is plastic that redoes all the objects that can be used every day, without touching natural resources.
It's plastic that comes from the yellow bin.
It's plastic that comes from your sorting gesture.
And that's why today, I'm launching a call for ideas, a call for projects.
Between you, with your friends, your associations, in the neighborhoods, try to find projects, ideas that revive the collection, that allow us to produce this, that allow us to transform plastic into resources.
And a resource is valuable.
A family that doesn't sort today is like throwing 30 euros a year in the trash.
You’ll say, “It’s little, 30 euros here. »
But if we take two hundred dwellings that do the same in a building, it's 6 000 euros.
A city or a district of 30 000 inhabitants, it is 900 000 euros that leave per year.
That's why I'm launching this call for projects.
Get organized, send us your proposals.
With local authorities, we will find solutions to select them, finance them.
Today I would like to tell you that our only competitor is inaction, and that three seconds, three seconds to create a barrier to pollution, it is simple and it is great.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Good evening everyone.
I'll tell you my story.
I'm 17, the bac in my pocket.
My father only dreams of one thing: that I prepare the competitions of the great schools.
He is himself at ESCP, where he teaches computer science, marketing.
And he said to me, "Go my son, hold on!
Go beyond your limits! »
Me, in fact, I think only of one thing, it is above all to go beyond the limits of my neighborhood.
I think only of one thing: going to travel far, [not only] to France but elsewhere.
As a result, I subscribed modestly to Nanterre University in Ethnology, then in ethnomusicology.
Ah!
This is a great opportunity to travel.
I work my thesis on the music of Benin, Northern Benin, a population called the Nyende.
Two months of travel, four months of travel...
But here I am, I can't finish my university degree.
I only think of one thing: it is to play music.
I'm a drummer, percussionist.
I work in different world music formations.
I love all the music: biguine, jazz, African music, Balkan music, rais, and so on.
In 2004, I founded my own training, called Haidouti Orkestar.
What is the Haidouti Orkestar?
It is the meeting of Balkan music, oriental music and Turkish music.
A whole program!
Does that mean anything to you?
Does that speak to you a little?
Not really.
So, this group is composed of musicians from very different backgrounds.
As Georges Moustaki would say: a real group of “metecs”.
There is a Greek from the Rue de la Roquette who aligns barely three words of Greek; a pure Gypsy of Serbia, a Bulgarian, French - yes, French like me, but scratching a little, never really French - a Spanish but who claims to be Catalan please, from Barcelona.
You know this band, Haidouti Orkestar?
No. No.
I hear "Yes," there's a person.
Good, here's an excerpt.
(Video: Haidouti Orkestar - "Ya Ayn Moulayiitain") (Sylvain on stage) This is a song in tribute to Syria, in the Arab Spring, at a time when we still have some hope.
Normally, in concert, there people get up and start dancing.
You can... It feels good too!
(Beat of hands in rhythm) (End of video) (Applause) Thank you!
I discover this music in the late 80's, it starts to date, especially through the films of Emir Kusturica "The Time of the Gypsies", "Underground".
I think everyone knows these movies.
Yes, anyway!
I'm love at first sight, an incredible click.
I am passionate about this music.
I literally fall in love with these musics and deepen the question.
This is the beginning of a long immersion in these cultures.
In this journey, I will meet people, musicians, because, for me, it is about going back to this world of Balkan music - in the music of the gypsies, I do not know anyone - meet Turkish music, look for all this.
There, it's done.
I'm going to portray three people who have meant a lot to me.
The first is Jasko Ramic.
Behind it is a woman in the snorkel.
She's the only woman in the group, please.
I think about her a lot, her name is Charlotte.
Let's go back to Mr. Jasko Ramic.
He's a Gypsy from Serbia.
It is a real virtuoso of the accordion, a real "size", as they say in the jargon.
He has an empirical, theoretical knowledge of all these musics.
I meet him in a cellar in Paris.
It's a Bulgarian friend musician who introduces me to it.
Besides, he's a polyglot man.
He speaks Russian.
He speaks Romani, and Serbo-Croatian.
But here I come, I speak French.
And I can't communicate with him.
Big problem, how to go beyond this limit?
Finally, we don't talk, we play.
Since then, we've been working together for over 10 years now.
He makes me discover this culture, this music, its energy, its nostalgia.
And I see that what I learn really contrasts with what I hear in the media.
In the media, what do I hear when we talk about gypsies?
I hear some pretty pretty things.
It's about slums, it's about child abduction.
And I really live something else.
I travel to Bulgaria, Macedonia, Greece.
I feel safe there.
I met generous people who give me their music literally.
There you go.
I advise you to go see the work of The Voice of the Rroms which is an association that takes care of a little of all this Roma problem and that gives a positive image.
A second person who has meant a lot to me, he is a trumpeter.
He is Lebanese, but in fact mostly French since he grew up a few kilometers from here, in the south of the department.
This boy has incredible energy.
I meet him, he's 25.
So it's been a good ten years.
He is Lebanese and his parents fled Lebanon.
It's important.
This boy, today, he is very well known.
His name is Mr. Ibrahim Maalouf.
I think you know him.
This boy brings us to the Olympia.
Recently, we wrote the music for Mohamed Hamidi’s film “The Cow,” with Djamel Wilson. Djamel Debbouze, Lambert Wilson!
(Laughter) (Video: "The great journey") (Sylvain on stage) That's the meeting of cultures!
Here's an extract.
(Video: Ibrahim Maalouf and Haïdouti Orkestar - "The great journey") (Sylvain on stage) This is the instrument I play, among other things.
I'm a drummer and I play drums.
(End of the video) (Applause) A third person who has counted a lot in my career, my journey, is Mr. Zéki Çölaş This man comes from Antioch to Turkey.
It's 80 km from Syria.
He fled Turkey at 30 for political reasons, the saz under his arm.
He passes through Syria, transits and stays in Germany, and ends in France, in Bobigny.
So this man, I meet him in a restaurant in Paris, a good fifteen years ago I don't know if it was a Kurdish restaurant or a Turkish restaurant.
At the time, for me, it's a little bit the same.
But no, actually, it's very, very different.
With that man, we'll walk.
He will show me the “Little Istanbul”.
Do you know little Istanbul?
The district of the small Istanbul is the Turkish district in Paris between Château d'Eau and Strasbourg Saint-Denis.
This is where culture and and this whole community is found.
So, we're walking the streets.
We're gonna meet his friends from the Özgül bookstore.
We go to listen to the latest news from Tuana Music, the only Turkish music store in Paris.
All the novelties, the records, the musical instruments, we find everything that concerns Turkey.
Very quickly, we have the wish to share things, to make known this Turkish music that we do not know, which is really unknown in France.
And, we also decide to go even further and open up to other cultures.
I had another card earlier.
It's not the same thing.
In any case, we are also interested in Armenia, in Azerbaijan.
We're trying to cross our boundaries, cross borders.
You will notice a little this whole region, today, it is a real powder keg, between the problem of migrants the Kurdish problem, Erdogan today who becomes a real dictator - we can say it clearly.
Here, at that time, associations are contacting us, associations that have values a little similar to ours, which are for sharing.
I think of Cimade, Added Value.
La Cimade, I meet them in Massy, not far from here.
Every year, they have a party where we eat a lot of things, different dishes from all countries.
That was a time of sharing.
I am also thinking of the BAAM, the Office of Reception and Support of Migrants.
Last September, we did a concert.
It was a great moment of emotion and sharing.
Somalis, Eritreans, Turks, French people, everyone found themselves together to commune around our music.
It was a great moment.
Here, more recently, I also wanted to go beyond genres so I went to meet jazz.
(Video: Haidouti Orkestar and Bojan Z-Tchagri) (Sylvain on stage) He is a Bosnian pianist.
I wanted, with this presentation, to show you how much music and my encounters had opened me to the world, and that interbreeding is a way to open up to the world.
There you go.
Thank you.
(Applause)
It's early in the morning.
You look in the mirror.
What are you saying?
Not long ago, I used to say, “Hey!
Hello handsome kid. »
(Laughter) Unfortunately, I was surprised to say, "Ouch ow ow... “He looks like my grandfather! »
You may love what you see in the mirror.
Or maybe not...
In any case, you recognize this image as yours.
How do you recognize yourself?
What is your identity?
This is crucial, because the way we define ourselves affects how we relate to others.
Before, I thought I had a very solid identity!
I was a Mexican ready to conquer the rest of the world.
So I started moving to Paris.
Eleven years ago.
And everything agreed according to my plans, until last year.
Indeed, 3 events led me to wonder: "Who is this person that I call me? »
"Hello!
Do we know each other? »
The first event, I call it: "Encounter with the ancestors".
One day, when I was surfing the Internet, I read an article that said: “If your last name is among the names on this list, then you may be a descendant of one of the Jewish Sephardic families who are expelled from Spain in the 15th century. »
And maybe soon you will be able to apply for Spanish citizenship.
I checked the list!
To my surprise, my father's last name, Meza, was there.
As a Mexican, I expected to have some Spanish blood in my veins.
But I never imagined that... Does that mean there's a little Jewish blood running through my Mexican veins?
Is that why I loved the movie “A Violin on the Roof” so much?
Or even, more importantly: do I have the right to put guacamole in my falafel now?
(Laughter) It may be crazy, but since I read this article, I feel closer to my Jewish side.
The second event: "Elementary course of cellular identity" I'm in conversation with my friend, Julien, French biologist of his state.
Antonio, from the point of view of biology, I can tell you that this question about your identity makes no sense.
I explain: your cells are reproducing and dying, okay?
And your body needs seven years for complete regeneration.
So you can say that after seven years you are an entirely different person than you were before. »
“Wait!” I said.
You know I've lived in France for eleven years.
And you're telling me that all this time, the cells in my body have been regenerating themselves with proteins coming directly from the camembert!
Cassoulet!
What about duck confit?
(Laughter) Does that mean that, from the point of view of biology, I'm already French? »
(Laughter) It may be crazy, but since that conversation with Julien, I feel closer to my French side.
And finally!
The third event: "The passage of the ring on the finger" And yes, last year I got married.
Thank you, thank you.
(Applause) And my lovely wife is German!
(Laughter) Finally, his mother is German and his father is Hungarian.
So she's half German and half Hungarian.
It may be crazy, but since I got married, I feel much closer to my new German and Hungarian sides!
It's like a whole new family!
But can you imagine when we have a child?
How to explain?
“My son, my daughter, your Mexican origins mean you have Spanish and Aztec strains.
But also Jewish roots!
Besides, you have a German trunk and Hungarian branches!
And you pushed on a French soil.
That makes you a very exotic plant! »
(Laughter) I think my kids will need at least four passports!
And good therapy.
After all these events, I was completely lost.
What is my people?
Do I have to give up who I am, before I kiss the one I become?
Who is this person I call “me”?
In the end, I was the one who needed good therapy.
But a few weeks later, I was taking a personal development course offered by my friend Robert of California.
At some point during the seminar, Robert proposed this exercise: You are face-to-face with another person, and looking at this one, you say: “I see you.
And I can see your strength.
And I can see your fragility.
And I know you're much more than that! »
When Robert explained this exercise, I really thought it was California hippie madness!
(Laughter) But when my partner in the exercise told me those words... (Long-line inspired) It may be crazy, but I felt much closer to myself.
Finally, I didn’t need to know in my head who I was, I could just recognize myself in each other’s eyes.
And his eyes became the mirror where I could recognize myself, I saw my origins, and my potential.
I could kiss the whole thing.
I could be much more than I imagined... And that's good!
It's early in the morning, you look in the mirror.
What are you saying?
You are much more than the color of your skin, much more than the borders of your countries and much more than your genetic heritage.
So tomorrow morning, when you go to see yourself in the mirror, try to say this to yourself: “Hello!
I can see you.
And I can see your strength.
And I can see your fragility.
And I know you're much more, much more than all that. »
Thank you.
(Applause)
Can you imagine patients having to wait weeks before you can be treated?
Last year, a hospital called me to coach a department that was about to close.
It was going to jeopardize some of the organization of the hospital.
The doctors resigned one after the other, the administrative and caregiver staff was completely demotivated.
And after analysis, it turned out that all this was related to the leadership style of the department head, which we will call Dr. X.
This Doctor X is a very authoritarian, very controlling and very uncommunicative person.
And yet, it is a global summit in its area of expertise.
You like me, as patients, want to be treated by these demigods on Earth, but if he is not able to keep his team, there is a good chance that his expertise will disappear with him, and that he cannot treat as many patients as he does today.
Being a great doctor doesn't make him a great manager.
And this, the headhunters understood this.
I'm Marie-Bernard Guillaume, and I'm going to explain to you tonight why, as a headhunter, I've become a hearthunter.
Most of the business leaders I meet share the same concern: how to motivate your staff?
According to Gallup studies, only one in ten employees is really happy at work, passionate.
Seven out of ten come to do their job but don’t ask them for more.
Two out of ten are even active saboteurs: they come with their discomfort and they prevent others from functioning properly.
Imagine the disaster that it would be if we applied this ratio to our national football team, to our Red Devils.
There, you start to have pain, you understand the problem of managers.
What makes an employee motivated?
You all know the pyramid of Maslow?
Forget it.
(Laughter) Other studies have shown that we all share three needs, three motivating factors, which are universal, whether you are male or female, whether you are young or old.
No matter the philosophical or religious beliefs, we share these factors and needs.
The first need is the need for personal development.
It is to be able to use my abilities to achieve my dreams, to achieve goals: "Wow, what I'm good!
I did it!
I'm proud of myself. »
The second need is the need for autonomy.
It's about being able to do what I want, when I want, and how I want.
The third need is the need for connectivity.
It is to be able to feel belonging and in connection with a community, with a team, with a family.
It is to be supported, to be liked on Facebook.
And so, as you will have understood, the company that is able to respond to these three factors is likely to see the engagement rate of its employees much higher than elsewhere.
However, most managers today still operate, like our Doctor X, with a hierarchical pyramid that is well defined, with roles and functions that frame the roles of everyone, which has the effect of bullying, killing any need for autonomy and any initiative.
Fortunately, fortunately, more and more companies have understood this problem and are implementing participatory, collaborative leadership cultures.
In these companies, the well-being of the employee takes precedence, the results, the success and the financial results are the consequences.
And not the other way around.
We also reverse the hierarchical pyramid to replace managers with teams that make decisions together, collectively.
We are not in the Bisounours, there are results to be achieved, there are goals, but there is above all a vision and values that are shared by all.
We're driving his work.
I could cite several examples of success.
I’m going to talk about a company you certainly know, given the middle age here: it’s about Netflix, a Silicon Valley company.
They decided to set up an HR culture in which we will advocate responsibility and freedom.
Imagine: you are free to organize your work as you see fit, and wherever you want; we do not check your expense notes; we will not control the number of days of leave you take; we simply ask you to act at best for the good of the company.
Isn't that a nice answer to the need for autonomy?
You are asked to take initiatives and we accept that you are wrong, because one does not go without the other.
This has the effect of creating a movement of innovation and [intrapreneurship] within the company.
I could cite other examples of success, but let's focus on the actors of these changes: who are they?
It is of course the managers and the managers, but it is also each of you, each of the employees, each of the employees.
And to plagiarize Gandhi, I would say, “Be the change you want to see in your company. »
And to do this, it requires beautiful human qualities, it requires a developed emotional intelligence.
And by this I mean qualities like empathy, benevolence, listening, tolerance.
How to develop this emotional intelligence?
You will say, “Some are more gifted than others. »
And the good news tonight is that you all have these qualities.
They are part of your human nature.
They are parasitized on a daily basis by the various stresses that surround us.
It can be physical stress - I challenge you to be kind to a dentist who is tearing you a tooth - emotional or mental.
And so you just have to let go of this stress to rediscover all these qualities and be able to deploy them around you.
Easy to say, but how to do it?
And that's where I would draw a parallel with the emergence in our society of mindfulness and meditation.
It is no coincidence that we see these tools emerging in hospitals, in schools, in companies, and even at the last world economics summit in Davos where we offered each of the participants a meditation session before starting the day.
I could do the display all the studies that demonstrate the correlation and positive impact of mindfulness on creativity and emotional intelligence.
I'm going to suggest tonight to experience a break of mindfulness, together.
I ask you to accept this exercise with this open mind that brought you here today, without prejudice.
It is a tool that you can use at any time of the day, on the train, in a queue, in a company before a meeting, and even during a TED talk.
Are you ready?
So, let's go.
I suggest you close your eyes, settle comfortably in your seat, feel the weight of your body on the seat, feet on the floor, the weight of the clothes on the skin.
You feel the breath of air on your face and hands.
Observe your breathing, simply.
Drop all tensions, all ideas, all judgments.
Breathe.
Now focus your attention on the closest sounds.
Expand your listening to the most distant sounds.
Just rest, just a few moments, here and now.
Breathe deeply, open your eyes, reconnect with the outside world, in this room, with your neighbors.
The world is changing.
Yesterday, in an industrial economy, headhunters were asked to recruit labour.
Today, in a knowledge-based economy, he is asked to recruit brains, diplomas.
I am convinced that artificial intelligence will give us access tomorrow to levels of knowledge like we have never had before.
I am convinced that artificial intelligence will make a diagnosis on the patient that will be more relevant than that of our Doctor X.
And what we'll expect from our Dr. X is his human qualities.
Because it is the human who will inspire others, it is the human who will bring new ideas, it is the human who will make the organizations and companies of tomorrow able to be successful.
And so we arrive in a humanist economy where the relational qualities of creativity and heart will be the criteria for the selection of headhunters.
I can therefore only encourage all of you to cultivate and deploy these beautiful qualities that you possess to practice without moderation mindfulness or any other tool that will allow you to reconnect with your own humanity, to your own infinitude.
Thank you and good work.
(Applause)
Beyond our solar system, there are planets that orbit other stars.
They are called exoplanets.
Exoplanets, because they are outside the solar system.
As you can imagine, it is really hard to detect them because they are very far from us.
And yet, regularly, astronomers announce that they have discovered new exoplanets.
There is even a recent study, which suggests that among all the exoplanets that must exist in our galaxy, there could be 20 billion, likely to have liquid water on their surface, and therefore to offer a potentially interesting environment for life.
Do you realize?
20 billion!
Well, if we want to study the criteria of the habitability of a planet, we will look at four criteria that must be met for this study to be a success.
The first criterion is that the planet is at the right distance from the star.
In reality, the image you have on the screen is an exoplanet drawing.
Because they are far too far away, we can't see this level of detail.
But what the artist wanted to represent is a planet in the living space of the star.
That is to say, at the surface of which the temperature would be the right one so that the water can subsist in the liquid state for a fairly long time.
Closer to us, in the solar system, there are also planets that can inform us about habitability.
So of course, today, to our knowledge, there is only one that is habitable and inhabited, it is the Earth, since we are here, and the other candidates are rare.
Mars, which according to the models is found or not in the area of habitability, and then satellites, giant planets, such as Europe around Jupiter, and Enceladus, around Saturn.
There, it is the tidal forces that compensate for the lack of solar energy.
I will tell you about Mars, and the Curiosity mission, which recently established that one day this planet has met the criteria for habitability.
Curiosity landed on Mars in August 2012.
The animation you see shows you the entrance into the atmosphere, the descent and the landing, which actually last seven minutes.
Seven minutes of terror, where the choreography must be performed perfectly, with very little margin of error.
Everything is pre-programmed.
First, a heat shield is used, then a parachute to brake, then backfuses, then a system of cranes, to install this 900 kg machine, accurately and gently on the surface of Mars.
The accuracy of the landing is a few kilometers, while we have just traveled hundreds of millions of kilometers between Earth and Mars, for nine months.
Unbelievable, right?
Curiosity is a NASA mission, led by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the University of Caltech in California, with several international collaborations.
It took five years to build it.
And Curiosity sends us new images of Mars every day.
From now on, I'll show you some real pictures.
Like this one.
So of course, to the eye of the neophyte, all the images of Mars are similar.
Now, what do we see, what do you see?
You see rocks, you see sand.
In short, Mars is a desert.
A very dry desert, even if we compare it to the earthly deserts.
But then, isn't there a contradiction with what I just said?
That Mars was an interesting planet to study habitability.
That the planet is at the right distance from the sun to have liquid water.
You see liquid water, you?
It's a matter of atmosphere.
Today the atmosphere of Mars is so thin, that you can not have liquid water on its surface.
We find ice in the basement, near the poles, we might find liquid water at great depth, but on the surface, today we have a desert.
At the same time, I'm sure you've heard in the news before, researchers announcing that we found evidence that there had been liquid water on the surface of Mars.
In the past, there have been.
So, my second criterion of habitability, after the distance, it's going to be time, the geological era.
It is necessary to be at the right time, to have the right atmosphere, which allows to have liquid water on the surface of the planet.
I'll explain.
When the planets form, at first, they are extremely hot.
As suggested by the drawing on your left.
In the case of the solar system, it was 4.6 billion years ago.
Then you can imagine the planets, as being thermal machines that cool down during their history.
So that at some point, for some of them, the temperature may be adequate, and the atmosphere may be adequate, to have liquid water on its surface.
This was the case, for Earth and for Mars, a little over 4 billion years ago.
This is what you see in the middle drawing.
And there has been a lot of evidence with space exploration that there has indeed been water on Mars.
So of course, at the beginning of space exploration in the 60's, the myth of the Martian was killed, revealing a desert planet.
But very quickly after, in the 70’s, the images that came back from Mars showed canyons that looked like dry river beds.
And more recently, the various missions have shown us that the minerals that form the rocks, some of these minerals, are formed in the presence of water.
We are therefore convinced, that indeed, in the distant past, Mars had liquid water on its surface.
And then the planet continued to evolve, with a lot of volcanism, its history has diverged from that of Earth, because it is smaller, to finally end up on this photo that you have on your right, which shows a planet with extinct giant volcanoes, huge canyons, and large desert expanses.
Why are we interested in this planet?
Well precisely, because, at some point in its history, there was water on the surface of Mars at the same time as there was water on the surface of the Earth.
And at that time, 3 or 4 billion years ago, life appeared on Earth.
We know very little about this part of our history, but we necessarily have questions.
Is this a unique phenomenon on Earth?
What should be the conditions for this to happen elsewhere?
And that's why when you study habitability on another planet, you have to study the right time, the time when there was liquid water in its evolution, in its history.
Curiosity, like the other missions, brought us his share of evidence that there was liquid water on his landing site.
And I must admit, the first time I saw this photo, I was working in California, we were on a Martian schedule.
It's a weird experience.
The first time I saw this picture, I thought it was a gag.
It could have been a sidewalk after an earthquake, something like that.
But in reality, the whole team was amazed, by this image that came from Mars, and that showed us a conglomerate.
That is, a rock that is formed of rock fragments that were transported there, and cemented together.
And what is remarkable to the eye of the geologist is that these rock fragments are rounded.
A little bit like pebbles if you want, little pebbles that we would find at the bottom of a river.
And the geologists are even able, with the shape of these rocks, to calculate the amount of water that has passed through it, and to tell you that there, there was a river with a depth a little less than a meter.
Of course, we had not chosen the landing site by chance.
But, this image revealed vividly, that we had landed in what is a day, was the delta of a river, which flowed there, several billion years ago.
Here, I'll show you this other image, another rock photographed by Curiosity a little further.
This flat rock also formed in the presence of water.
In reality, there were already some in the first photo that I showed you, the one where we talked about desert.
It is a sedimentary rock, that is, it is formed of very small fragments that have been transported by the wind or by the rivers, and which in this case have settled at the bottom of a lake to form this rock.
And then the water continued to flow through the fractures of the rock, as evidenced by the small clear vein that is in the middle of the rock.
And Curiosity is able to measure the composition of these rocks, with several instruments.
For example, ChemCam, the instrument I work with, uses a laser that will pull on the rock, it will make a small spark, and to make simple, the color of the spark tells us the chemical elements that are in the rock.
And so, I can tell you that the composition of the vein is different from the composition of the rock, and that this vein is rich in sulfur.
It's an interesting element if I'm interested in life.
There are others, such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus.
In reality, the composition of the rocks, will allow us to know under what conditions it has formed.
And beyond, what was the environment of this region on Mars, when this rock formed.
What was the temperature?
Was the water acidic?
Was the atmosphere oxidizing?
What were the chemical elements that were present?
Were there those who are useful to life?
To answer all these questions, I will have to use all the instruments of Curiosity, because it forms my 3rd criterion of habitability.
It is not enough to be at the right distance from the star and to be at the right time to have liquid water, I also have to have the chemical environment that is welcoming, say, for life.
And if possible, that it lasts long enough, because it will take time for life to evolve.
So, here's Curiosity in his lake, dried up for some time.
This area has been called Yellowknife Bay.
It's a real photo, a selfie, one more.
Curiosity is a little more than two meters wide, it is a little bigger than me, it is equipped with a dozen instruments, including two Franco-American instruments, ChemCam and Sam, both of which measure the composition of the rocks.
ChemCam, this is the laser I told you about, we see its telescope at the top of the mast.
He's going to draw up some kind of chemical panorama around the robot.
And Sam is going to be able to make a very fine measure of the composition, when we take a rock sample.
Well since the landing, hundreds of researchers and engineers, take turns daily to operate, to operate Curiosity on the surface of Mars.
At the end of its day, the robot returns all these observations to Earth via a relay satellite.
The international team understands this, discusses it, and decides what to do the next day, the business plan.
Are we going to make a new measure?
Are we going to move the robot?
The on-board computer is then programmed, which will run this program automatically the following day.
And so on.
This is a pretty great and accomplished example of collaborative work, and I have the chance with a few colleagues, and with the help of CNES, to participate here in Toulouse.
Curiosity is also equipped with a small drill, a small drill, I will zoom in on this photo, we can see the hole that has been dug in the rock, which turns out to be a clay, so a rock that has formed in the presence of water too, and we notice that the powder of this rock has a different color, it is grayish, it is different from the color of the Martian surface which is red.
We can also see the marks that the laser left by sampling this rock powder.
Well, by bringing together all the results, of all these instruments, and the knowledge of all these researchers involved in this project, we have come to the conclusion, that this region of Mars, when these rocks formed, several billion years ago, gathered the conditions of habitability.
Namely, that we had one or more episodes with water, perhaps for a few tens of thousands of years, that this water was fresh, pH neutral, salinity weak, and that we had the chemical elements, which could have been useful to a microscopic life if it had been there.
To this last question, we do not know how to answer.
Habitability does not mean inhabited.
So we don't know, we don't have the elements to say whether there was life or not.
But we have the elements to say that the environment was favorable, was compatible.
So admit that Mars seems a little less desert.
That's great, isn't it?
Let's take a little height with this photo.
It is a photo that is taken by a satellite that orbits Mars, a region that is a little further south than the one I just showed you, which is called "the Kimberley".
And Curiosity stopped, and we can see him in the photo, he's here.
And maybe you also see the tracks that his wheels left in the sand to get to this corner.
And so we continue our mission as geologists, to try to understand how the planet Mars works.
And we continue to question habitability.
Besides, I had announced to you a 4th criterion, which is useful, interesting, when we want to study habitability.
And also, we could ask ourselves, why did we stop at this place to do a new drilling, and why not elsewhere?
Well you will have understood, the information we are looking for is recorded in the rock.
So it's a solid record, but on the time scales we consider, this information may very well disappear.
And this is what is happening on Earth, which is a geologically very dynamic planet.
So I have this information in my rock, and I have to protect it.
And generally, it happens by covering this interesting layer of rock with another layer of rock or by sand.
But then, it is necessary after that I rediscover this information, when I do my exploration.
And so, either you are able to dig deep enough, you do archaeology in a way.
Either, you're letting erosion go.
And that's what's happening here.
The wind has blown for millions of years, and has uncovered rock mounds in the subsoil that are five meters high, the three mounds you can see, which are therefore rocks that formed billions of years ago, and therefore inform us about how Mars was at that time.
So, to conclude, while you contemplate this panorama that shows us the richness of the site explored by Curiosity, I just wanted to make you touch the quest for habitability.
Being at the right distance from the star, being in the right time, having the right environment, and having preserved the information.
If you want to be interested in life, you will also have to leave time, when you have the favorable conditions, to this life to evolve.
We are not there yet today, but a whole part of the research continues to develop, to ask these questions, it is exobiology.
I would like you to realize, on the one hand, the multitude of options offered to us by all these planets.
And on the other hand, the beauty of the Earth that is habitable.
Everything that is accessible to us by the mind, and the finitude of the cosmos accessible to Humanity.
Then you say, “What’s the point? »
Well, yes, I am often asked this question, what is it for?
And I answer you, “To nothing. »
Yeah, because if the question is, it's whether it's going to make money, and change my everyday life, right now, right.
However, remember the lesson that Raymond Devos bequeathed to us.
“Nothing is nothing. »
He had shown that we could get something with nothing by multiplying it.
He said, “Once nothing is nothing.
Twice nothing is not much.
But three times nothing...
You can already get something with three times nothing.
Isn't it? »
Well, research is exactly that.
Basic research is to accumulate these little things that make our knowledge, a shared knowledge.
So of course, at the turn of a project like this, we also improve our technology, but above all, we exercise our ability to think, which is our asset.
We mobilize our knowledge to understand complex phenomena.
So, ladies and gentlemen, please keep getting drunk on curiosity.
(Applause)
Good evening.
I'm gonna start again, actually.
(Laughter) Good evening!
(Applause) Good evening, then my subject is: To take advantage of the vice.
The subject looks a little pompous, so I will start with a very down-to-earth thing: a photo of my grandmother, Monique alias Mamou, in fact.
My story begins two years ago, when Monique offered me a book on social entrepreneurship, a book by Muhammad Yunus.
Like many, I loved this book for two things: one, social entrepreneurship, it's great to undertake not to maximize profits, but to solve social problems, and second, I liked my race, the fact that, precisely, we can see the positive in everything he did.
That's what he does, Muhammad, he sees the positive in every stuff he describes, even capitalism.
So, it pushed me to try to think about ideas to address issues caused by capitalism.
Today the economic system in which we are, he walks, he is perfect like Jessica Alba, no it is a joke.
Try to laugh for the jokes.
There are some flaws, some problems, those left behind in the system.
Inequalities, environmental problems, pollution, mass unemployment, etc.
Besides that, there are also excessive things.
For example, there are budgets that are excessive.
Especially one, which for me was really in excess, it was advertising.
I'll give you two seconds to read this sentence.
One, two.
What’s great about this phrase is that she’s in the movie 99 Francs and she really puts two parts of capitalism in opposition.
On the one hand what is in excess, that is to say the advertising budgets, budgets that are colossal.
Advertising itself is not negative.
It creates desire, promotes a product.
It's not unhealthy in itself.
It is still an excessive budget.
The other part of the sentence really shows the flaws of capitalism, which it cannot fill.
Inequality North-South, for example.
Finally, we realize that with this phenomenal budget, less than half would eliminate hunger in the world.
This shows a real gap between the two.
I thought to myself: why not see them in opposition anymore but try to connect them?
Create a tool that allows you to, a bit like Robin Hood, create a link that diverts part of the advertising budget, excessive, to fill one of these flaws.
I started thinking, etc.
I finally got an idea.
She arrived at a moment a little unexpectedly, in the shower actually.
There are two places to think, in the shower and in the toilet.
I was more in the shower.
I came up with this idea, I was very happy.
Today this idea has turned into a start-up called Goodeed.
We're raising money today, we're 4 people.
Thank you.
(Applause) Tristan and Thomas are in the room.
Thomas couldn't have come because of car problems.
Tristan is the web designer of Goodeed, he is in the room.
This really cool idea, what is it?
It is a website for making free donations.
You go to this site, you choose a donation, a vaccine, a tree or a meal.
Then you watch a pub spot.
The money that the advertising generates is funding its donation.
This is a free donation for the user.
It's the first side.
The second, not for the user, but for the advertiser, the one I want to deepen tonight, is to show that what is in excess in capitalism, a budget seen as excessive, as something negative finally, is now re-humanized.
We gave the pub a new meaning.
Advertising budgets have been allowed to find meaning, utility.
Today Goodeed has helped finance with WFP in Kenya, the meals of 18 000 children for a month.
And that, just because of your donations, there were more than 500 000, and thanks to the pub.
Finally, what can be seen as negative, can also be positive.
You just have to create a tool, try to innovate to turn it into something positive.
And that the Chinese have been doing it for millennia.
It's in their vocabulary.
Crisis in Chinese is called “Weiji”.
“Wei,” which is the danger.
The first symbol is a man who threatens someone else with a knife.
It doesn't show like that, but that's it.
The second symbol is opportunity, opportunity.
It's "Ji."
It shows that in the most critical situations, we can bounce back.
You see the positive in the negative.
Thanks to a situation that destabilizes us, we will be stimulated, see other things, differently, in a young way.
I came to tell you this tonight: try to see things fixed, like advertising, it is necessarily an excessive, negative budget, there are flaws in capitalism.
You can see them differently and try to create links by innovating.
So, create companies that have this social aspect in their DNA.
Good evening, thank you very much.

According to the World Health Organization, 100 million litres of blood are missing worldwide to meet the needs of the world's population.
In addition, the French Blood Establishment informs us that 90% of French people know that blood donation can save lives.
And despite this figure, only 4% to carry out this gesture every year.
And this scenario is repeated in most industrialized countries.
Faced with this gap between human blood donations and the needs of the world population, we must find an alternative to this practice, in order to respond to this real public health problem.
And, as amazing as it may seem, I may have found one of the solutions.
And the solution, I found it on a beach in Brittany.
Already small, I was fascinated by the oceans, and I think that the emissions of Commander Cousteau were not foreign.
So I naturally decided to make it my profession, and I became a doctor in marine biology.
An environment caught my attention very early on, because this environment was colonized by very old organisms.
This environment is the foreshore, or a scientific name for an environment that you must appreciate since in fact, it is the beach.
And the beach in Brittany is covered twice a day by the tide.
And the sand of this beach is home to very old organisms that you have certainly seen, by the traces that these organisms leave on the sand, by laying your towel.
In fact, these traces testify to the presence of a marine organism called the arenaculture.
So the arenicole is the name of a marine worm very well known on the beaches in Brittany whose name in Breton is the Buzuc.
So I was interested in this seaworm to answer questions of respiratory ecophysiology.
So what does that mean?
Oh, it's simple, I was interested in the breathing of this seaworm.
I was trying to actually understand how this worm was breathing between high and low tide.
And in order to answer this question of basic research, (Laughter) I was interested in the blood of this animal.
Blood is an extremely interesting biological fluid.
It is the interface between the physiology of an organism and its environment.
In fact, blood is composed of different cells, but the molecule that carries oxygen, the oxygen essential to all living organisms, which is a little - if I took an example related to mechanics - oxygen, it's a bit the fuel you're going to put in your vehicle.
Fuelless is the dry breakdown.
And without oxygen, it's life-saving death.
In fact, blood contains a type of cell called red blood cells.
Red blood cells are a small vehicle that will transport the gas to the cells of your body.
And to be more precise, this molecule contains a protein called hemoglobin.
Hemoglobin is a molecule that is able to reversibly bind oxygen.
And what was not my surprise, to discover that the blood of this marine worm here had no red blood cells.
Oh, I have to be honest, when I started my discovery, I didn't know the extent of this work.
But [my discovery] went back to the ears of a learned club, which is called the Club du Globule Rouge.
(Laughter) So I was invited to Paris, in a Parisian hospital to present my research work in front of a bed of doctors, hematologists.
And at the end of my scientific conference, several of them went down to the bottom of the amphi and asked me the following questions: “But Sir, you have not found this molecule that has this structure, who has this function? »
"Well, yes! »
“But we’ve been looking for this molecule for over 40 years to make it a universal blood substitute! »
You and I have an ABO blood type, positive rhesus or negative Rhesus.
Only the negative O is of the universal donor type.
The absence of red blood cells in this animal gave this molecule a universal character.
And back in the laboratory, in order to test this hypothesis, I hastened to go to the beach to collect a few hundred areniculturals, simply to try to collect them the hemoglobin contained in their circulatory system, and after purification of this molecule by conventional laboratory techniques, I hastened to transfuse rodents.
And what was not my surprise, after exsanguination of these laboratory animals at more than 80%, I transfused this molecule to these animals, and nothing happened.
(Laughter) The organisms, these rodents, lived with marine worm hemoglobin.
An amazing discovery, and today a huge hope for medicine.
A nose to all these skeptics who asked me the question: "But what's the point of studying the breathing of a seaworm?
(Laughter) You really don't have other things to do in a CNRS lab? »
(Laughter) In order to accompany this research, I am forced to leave the CNRS to create a biotechnology company that will be responsible for developing these molecules towards medical applications.
And it only takes a few hundred grams of arenagoes to make a globular type pocket.
The applications of this molecule are numerous.
Why?
Well simply because oxygen is at the center of all biological and physiological processes, so, ultimately, life.
In the early years of the creation of this company, I spent them developing an industrial process of producing my seaworms.
Indeed, by being a biologist, it was out of the question for me to go and discard all the beaches in Brittany.
And today, these worms are produced in aquaculture, in a totally controlled and traced environment.
Several hundred tonnes of this animal are produced in aquaculture.
Apart from the worm, the raw material, the biomass, it was also necessary to find an industrial production system for the extraction of these molecules under pharmaceutical conditions.
And today, we actually have a whole process that allows to extract molecules from biomass.
From this industrial and marine worm production process, the applications are extremely numerous.
And I'll name three of them, but there are a lot of them.
First is blood transfusion.
You know, when you donate your blood, a pocket of blood can be kept 42 days, because the red blood cells are perishable.
In addition, it is necessary to maintain the cold chain at 4 °C.
I remind you that this molecule is not contained in a red blood cell.
And it is thus possible to obtain freeze-dried blood, that is to say powdered blood, which can be put back into solution thanks to pharmaceutical water.
So no more storage problems.
More conservation problem at 4 °C.
This product could be quickly available on emergency areas, on cataclysm areas, where you really need to transfuse patients.
This product is now in development thanks to a partnership with the U.S. military.
The second application is healing.
So not any type of wound.
Wounds that will be found in people who suffer from diabetes, called diabetic foot syndrome, people who suffer from pressure ulcers, the big burns, all these wounds have the characteristic of poorly healing.
Why?
Well simply because the blood circulation is hurting.
And unfortunately, the wounds that will be found in people with diabetes usually end badly since most of these people are amputated.
And this affects 20 million people around the world.
We were able to show that dressings impregnated by this molecule were capable of delivering oxygen to the feet, therefore in these wounds, and therefore, ultimately, to avoid amputation.
The third of these applications, which is now the most successful since a human trial will take place at the end of the year, is organ transplantation.
In France, 500 people die per year for lack of grafts on a waiting list of 19 000 patients.
Why?
Because in fact, the solutions that are used today in the clinic are composed only of water and salt but no oxygen carrier.
When an organ is removed from a donor, it is immediately disconnected from the bloodstream.
And we were able to show that by using this molecule, it was possible to significantly increase the retention time of a graft.
A heart today is four hours, between the collection at the donor's home and the time when we go to the recipient.
A kidney is 12 hours.
With this molecule, today, we were able to double the conservation time of these organs and multiply by four the retention time of a kidney.
So today, we are able to increase the pool of grafts available for transplantation.
The search is moving forward, but it is not moving as fast as we would like.
Why?
Because the drug cycle is long, very long, very, very long, and while waiting for the marketing of our product, which could save millions of lives around the world, I can only encourage you to go and donate your blood.
Be generous in saving lives.
And a little advice with friends, go fast, because tomorrow, it could be a gesture of another time.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I returned from Agadez, Niger.
Agadez, perhaps some know, it was the pearl of the Sahara, the gateway to the desert, the blessed stage of Paris-Dakar.
Today there is more of a tourist since the 2010 kidnappings.
There are migrants, hundreds and hundreds of migrants from West Africa.
The mayor entrusted me: to the season conducive to migration, the population of the city triples.
In 2 weeks when it will be less hot.
39° instead of 45.
For those who cross the Sahara in the back of the pickup trucks to Libya, that counts.
So you're going to tell me: not yet stories of migrants, we hear only that.
And if I told you that we don't actually talk about it anymore.
We're only talking about refugees.
The ones we show you on TV are Syrians, Iraqis.
They are fleeing a war.
We were told that they are doctors, lawyers, that at home they have a big house, a housekeeper.
They're a bit like us, they're white.
I cover Africa for Le Point magazine.
And the ones I've started watching since June, they're the ones we don't want at home.
They are poor, not very educated, they are black.
They will never have refugee status.
They will always be confined to the migrant on the move.
When the Syrians take a few weeks to reach Europe, they take several years.
Many people get stuck in Libya.
Some are murdered for no reason.
Many die on the way to the Sahara.
The desert is littered with corpses.
The idea came to me in April: I was waiting in line in a service for my computer.
A nice retiree came to sit next to me, look for company.
She asked what my job was.
So I said to him: reporter in Africa.
She said, “My poor man, it mustn’t be funny. »
I said, “No, I like it. »
“I don’t understand why these people come to our house.
There's no job for them.
They're coming for the allocs?
Then they sleep on my landing and they feel strong. »
So I said, "Madam, I know where they came from and you would do the same. »
My ticket number was finally out, I got up, draped in my dignity, and then I wondered: do we really know why they leave, these people?
Those who do not flee a war.
Are they really better at home?
So I looked for a country whose inhabitants would flee en masse and that would not be at war.
It was not very difficult, the International Organization for Migration had just released a report, and the country whose largest number of nationals in absolute terms had attempted to cross the Mediterranean between January and March 2015, it was the Gambia.
More than Syria, more than Nigeria.
Nigeria has 175 million inhabitants.
The Gambia: 1.9.
Very small country.
He was a general save-who-can-general.
I wanted to understand.
Of course, there were clues: a dictator who arrived in a coup in 94, Yaya Jammeh - claims that he can cure AIDS through a drink based on plants and verses from the Quran, which makes his opponents disappear, when they are not slaughtered in public.
There were economic indicators: 1700 dollars of GDP per capita, which puts the country 210th out of 230.
Human development.
They are 172th out of 187.
In short, misery.
Once there, I realized that it was even more complicated.
It's always like that.
We always discover on the spot.
It was a mixture of poverty, ignorance, hope, social pressure that drove young people to leave.
And there was absolutely nothing that could dissuade them.
That's why I followed the path, I went to Agadez, the hub of migration.
And that's why I want to talk to you tonight about everything we think we know about migrants and that's absolutely wrong.
First misconception: it costs super expensive to cross; with all this money, they couldn't have done anything else?
Put up a box?
Well no.
Because they don't leave with all the money they need to travel, they don't have it.
They work on the way.
Take the example of Jamal Barry, 25, met in The Gambia, near Serekunda.
Djamal makes furniture.
When I met him, his last order was a month: two armchairs, a 2-seater sofa, a 3-seater sofa.
Paid 450 dalasis by his boss.
9 euros for 12 working days.
Djamal's parents died, he had 4 siblings, he wanted to send money from Europe, and then like many, he had to stop in Libya.
He had no money at all.
He had been racketeed at the checkpoint of all the countries crossed.
So, Senegal, Mali, Burkina, Niger, Libya.
And then he was kidnapped.
And then he got sick.
So he came home after 8 months.
He still drew me the truck on which the Tuaregs are transporting migrants to the Sahara.
You can see, these are cages arranged to store as much as possible.
He was sitting at the end of a beam.
He had to hang on so he wouldn't fall because the truck didn't stop.
At the beginning of the journey, they were tight.
And less and less, because they were swinging in the desert the bodies of those who died of dehydration.
He said, “Every day I’m going back because here I’m already dead. »
Second misconception.
They are disloyal.
They abandon their countries that need these forces.
It's exactly the opposite: they leave to help the family.
In Africa, there is no pension insurance.
Children provide the old days of their parents.
Take the case of this gentleman, Balamin Jaiteh.
The photo he holds in his hands is that of his son, Yankuba.
Yankuba was 23 when he tried the trip, he too thought he was reaching Europe, he too had to stop in Sebha, Libya.
And he didn't have any luck.
Libyans were looking for an African from his ghetto.
These are the houses where migrants pile up before they can continue.
He told them he didn't know where he was.
He was told, “You lie, black people, you all know each other. »
They sprayed him with gasoline.
They scraped a match.
Yankuba died burned alive.
His father took days to talk to me, he felt guilty.
He said, “I did that too, as early as 1975.
I worked in Mali, Burkina Faso, Gabon, Côte d’Ivoire, Niger and Libya.
It's normal to help his old parents, besides all the time he could work, he sent us money; you see, we were able to remake the house. »
His wife stared at the floor.
One of her daughters went to hide to cry.
When I asked Balamin, “You forbade your sons to leave?
Did you tell them it was dangerous?
He said, “No, not clearly. »
For the moment, it is not a source of money that he can deprive himself of.
Third misconception.
They're not that poor, they have cell phones.
So, yes, they have cell phones, they even sometimes even have that.
No electricity, no running water, but smartphones.
Not the latest, old imitations that take hours to recharge, hours to display a web page.
Because the most formidable smuggler, the most liar, is not Agadez's little hunt that crowds migrants in the back of his pick-up truck.
No, it's internet.
It's social media.
They spend hours dreaming in front of the photos of those who have already spent in Europe, and dreaming that one day too, they will manage to cross.
Fourth misconception.
They will all sweep over France to get the family allowances.
No, it's on the edge of the vexant, I know, but not one has spoken of France.
At the bus station of Niamey, the capital of Niger, I spoke with a Malian who insisted on speaking to me in English, because his boss was from Nigeria, so English-speaking, he wanted to practice his English.
It was aimed at Europe, but not France at all.
England or especially Germany.
Even the Senegalese of the ghettos of Agadez, they dream of Germany, they do not even know that we do not speak French there.
As for the allocs, no one knows that it exists.
Let's go for a little detour through Kenya.
This is Farhiyo Salah, 22 years old.
Farhiyo grew up in the world's largest refugee camp on the border with Somalia, called Dadaab.
Today there are 350 000 people.
When I met her in July, she had just got a scholarship to study in Canada.
She told me: “All my life I’ve been assisted by NGOs, now I want to have my job, earn my own money, become independent.
That way, I'll come back, and I'll change the status of women in Africa. »
Farhiyo wants to become a diplomat or gynecologist, not having 8 children at Canada’s expense.
Finally, 5th idea received: there are too many problems at home, they will always dream of Europe.
There's nothing to do.
Yes and no.
Europe is indeed this place from which the brothers write: "Come only, there is work here." but for most of those I have spoken to, if they had had a choice, they would have done like previous generations: they would have migrated within Africa, and especially in Libya.
The first time Ousmane Sawo, 38, went to Libya, was in 2008.
He stayed 2 and a half years.
He was a mason.
He earned about 200 euros a month.
He was able to build his house in The Gambia.
It became too dangerous, one of his friends died in front of his eyes.
He's back.
In 2013, there was no money at all.
He thought he would do like everyone else and try to go to Italy.
As a boat, he found himself in prison for 6 months in Tripoli, because of a scam by his smuggler.
Ousmane, today, wins in The Gambia, the days when he has work, 4 euros.
For children's schooling and food alone, he spends 3.
He said, “I just have to make a tea at home to go over my budget.
Every day that God does, I pray that none of my children will get sick, because I could not have him treated. »
As the Senegalese of Agadez told me: "Madam, we are forced to cross, because it is not going well in Libya. »
They said, "Madam, the worst thing is to die poor.
Then we have no choice. »
Even if they are afraid, even if they have seen the images of shipwrecks on France 24.
They told me, "Madam, death is nothing, we try luck. »
That's why it's never going to be a point in closing the borders.
Because until these young Africans have hope for a better life, of a life at home, they will continue to come.
And you see, we would do the same, too.
Thank you.
(Applause)
