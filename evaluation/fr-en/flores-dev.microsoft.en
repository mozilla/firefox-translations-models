Last month, there were large protests in Poland when the country signed ACTA, which decided the Polish government not to ratify the agreement for now.
Latvia and Slovakia have both delayed the ACTA accession process.
Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) are again calling for mandatory surveillance cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses.
RSPCA New South Wales Chief Inspector David O'Shannessy told ABC that slaughterhouse monitoring and inspection should be a matter of course in Australia.
"Video surveillance would certainly send a strong message to people working with animals that their welfare is of utmost importance"
According to data from the U.S. Geological Survey's International Earthquake Map, no earthquakes occurred in Iceland in the previous week.
Moreover, according to the Icelandic meteorological office, the Hekla region has not experienced an earthquake in the last 48 hours.
The large earthquake that caused the phase change occurred on March 10 on the northeast face of the caldera at the top of the volcano.
Dark clouds unrelated to any volcanic activity have been reported at the base of the mountain.
The clouds presented a risk of confusion as to whether a true eruption had occurred.
The Luno had 120–160 cubic metres of fuel on board when it broke down, as high winds and waves pushed it into the breakwater.
Helicopters rescued the twelve crew members and the only injury was a broken nose.
The 100-metre vessel was on its way to retrieve its usual cargo of fertilizer, and authorities initially feared it would spill its fuel into the sea.
The proposed amendment was already passed by both chambers in 2011.
A change was made during this legislative session when the second bill was first struck down by the House of Representatives and then passed the Senate on Monday in a similar form.
The failure of the second sentence, which proposes to prohibit civil unions between persons of the same sex, could potentially open the door to civil unions in the future.
Following this process, the HJR-3 will be reviewed by the next elected legislature in 2015 or 2016 to remain pending.
Vautier's achievements outside of directing include a hunger strike in 1973 against what he saw as political censorship.
French law has been amended. His activism dates back to the age of 15, when he joined the French Resistance during World War II.
He researched a book published in 1998.
In the 60s, he returned to Algeria, recently independent, to teach filmmaking.
Japanese judoka Hitoshi Saito, winner of two Olympic gold medals, has died at the age of 54.
The cause of death was reported as intrahepatic bile duct cancer.
He died in Osaka on Tuesday.
In addition to being Olympic Champion and World Champion, Saito was President of the Japan Judo Federation at the time of his death.
At least 100 people attended the party, to celebrate the first anniversary of a couple whose wedding was held last year.
The authorities said an official anniversary ceremony had been planned for a later date.
The couple married in Texas a year ago and came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and relatives.
The husband, a 30-year-old Buffalo native, was among the four victims of the shooting, but his wife was not injured.
A famous but no less controversial English tutor who taught at Modern Education and King's Glory, Karno claimed to have led 9,000 students at the height of his career.
In his notes, he used words that some parents consider rude, and he allegedly used swear words in class.
Modern Education accused him of printing large ads on buses without permission, and pretending to be the primary tutor of English.
He was also previously charged with copyright infringement, but has not been charged.
One former student said he "used slang in class, taught flirting techniques in writing, and behaved like a friend to students."
Over the past three decades, although it has officially remained a communist state, China has developed a market economy.
The first economic reforms were carried out under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China's economic size has grown 90-fold.
For the first time, last year, China exported more cars than Germany and overtook the United States as the largest market for this industry.
China's GDP could surpass that of the United States over the next two decades.
Tropical Storm Danielle, the fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The maximum sustained wind speed of this storm, which occurs about 4,800 km from Miami, Florida, reaches 64 km/h.
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will become a hurricane by Wednesday.
As the storm is far from reaching shore, it remains difficult to assess its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Born in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, Bobek rose to prominence playing for Partizan Belgrade.
He joined it in 1945 and remained there until 1958.
During his time with the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 games.
No other player has ever made more appearances or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
In 1995, he was voted the best player in the history of Partizan.
The festivities kicked off with a special show from the world-renowned Cirque du Soleil group.
This was followed by the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, a Janissary group, and singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.
Then the whirling dervishes went on stage.
Turkish diva Sezen Aksu has performed with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
Finally, the Turkish dance group Fire of Anatolia presented the show "Troy".
Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcycle racer, died after being involved in an accident at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
During the warm-up lap, Lenz fell off his bike and was hit by fellow racer Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately picked up by medical staff on the runway and transported to a local hospital where he later died.
Zayat escaped unscathed from the accident.
"Regarding the global financial situation, Zapatero went on to say that "the financial system is part of the economy, an essential element."
We are going through a year-long financial crisis, which has had its most acute moment in the last two months, and I think now the financial markets are starting to recover. »
Last week, Naked News announced plans to seriously increase the number of hours dedicated to the international language newspaper, with three new programs.
Already present in English and Japanese, the global organization launches programs in Spanish, Italian and Korean, for television, web and mobile devices.
Luckily, nothing happened to me, but I witnessed a macabre scene, where people were trying to break windows in order to get out.
People hit the windows with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.
"One of the windows eventually broke, and they started coming out the window," said Franciszek Kowal, a survivor.
Stellar bodies give off light and heat because of the energy created when hydrogen atoms fuse (or condense) to create heavier elements.
Scientists are working to create a reactor that can produce energy in the same way.
This, however, is a very difficult problem to solve and it will be many years before successful fusion reactors are built.
The steel needle remains submerged because of the tension on the surface.
The tension of the surface is created because the magnetism between the water molecules on the surface is so much stronger than with the air molecules above them.
The water molecules form an invisible film on the surface that allows objects like the needle to float on the water.
The blade of a modern ice skate has two ends with a concave hollow located in between. These two ends allow better grip to the ice, even when inclined.
Since the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, when the blade tilts to one side or the other, the edge that is in contact with the ice also curves.
It makes the skater spin. If the skates lean to the right, the skater turns to the right, if the skates lean to the left, the skater turns left.
To return to the previous energy level, they must get rid of the excess energy stored in contact with light.
They do this by emitting a tiny particle of light called a "photon."
Scientists call this process "stimulated emission of radiation" because atoms are stimulated by bright light, which causes a photon of light to be emitted (light being a type of radiation).
The following image shows the atoms emitting photons. Of course in reality the photons are much smaller than those represented in the image.
Photons are even smaller than particles forming atoms!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the filament in the bulb eventually burns and the light bulb no longer works.
The bulb must then be replaced. Care should be taken when changing the bulb.
First, the light fixture switch must be turned off or the cable unplugged.
This is due to the fact that the electric current flowing through the socket, where the metal part of the bulb is embedded, can lead to severe electric shocks if you come into contact with its interior or metal base while the bulb is still partially inserted into the socket.
The main organ of the cardiovascular system is the heart, which pumps blood.
Blood travels away from the heart in tubes called arteries and back to the heart in tubes called veins. The smallest tubes are called capillaries.
A triceratops dentition would have been able to crush not only leaves, but also very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that triceratops ate cycads, a type of plant that was very common during the Cretaceous period.
These plants look like a small palm tree with a crown of pointed and spiky leaves.
A triceratops could have used its powerful beak to remove the leaves before eating the trunk.
Other scientists claim that these plants are very poisonous, so it is unlikely that a dinosaur ate them, although today the sloth and other animals like the parrot (a descendant of dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
How might the gravity of Io affect me? If you stood on the surface of Io, you would weigh less than on Earth.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16kg) on Io. So gravity, of course, attracts you less.
The Sun does not have a crust like the Earth on which one can stand. The entire Sun is made of gas, fire and plasma.
The gas becomes scarce as one moves away from the center of the Sun.
The outer part we see when we look at the Sun is called the photosphere, which means "ball of light."
About three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galileo used a telescope to observe that Venus has phases, just like the moon.
Phases occur because only the side of Venus (or the Moon) facing the Sun is illuminated. The phases of Venus justified Copernicus' theory that the planets revolve around the Sun.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a transit of Venus.
England had experienced a long period of peace after the reconquest of the Danelaw.
However, in 991, Ethelred had to face a Viking fleet larger than any other since Guthrum's a century earlier.
This fleet was commanded by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian who had the ambition to remove his country from Danish domination.
After the first military failures, Ethereld reached an agreement with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to reconquer his kingdom, to mixed results.
Hangeul is the only alphabet invented on purpose to be used in everyday life. The alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418 – 1450).
Sejong the Great was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty and remains one of Korea's most respected rulers.
Originally, he gave the Hangeul alphabet the name Hunmin Jeongeum, which means "the correct sounds to instruct the people."
There are many theories about how Sanskrit came about. One of them concerns an Aryan migration from the west to India that came with its language.
Sanskrit is an ancient language, it is comparable to the Latin language spoken in Europe.
The oldest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of the Upanishads, Sanskrit simply faded due to hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, which has served as the source for many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the source of European languages such as French and Spanish.
Once the battle for the France was over, Germany began preparing to invade the island of Britain.
Germany codenamed the attack "Operation Sea Lion." The British Army had lost most of its heavy artillery and ammunition during the evacuation of Dunkirk, and was therefore quite weakened.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy ("Kriegsmarine") and could have destroyed any invasion fleet sent across the English Channel.
However, very few Royal Navy ships were based near the likely invasion routes as the admirals feared being sunk by a German air attack.
Let's start by explaining the strategy of Italy, the main "dolphin" of Germany and Japan.
Their army and fleet were weaker, despite the fact that they had built four new ships just before the war began.
Italy's main objectives were African countries. To conquer these countries, it was necessary to have a launching base for the troops, so that they could cross the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
For this, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. Apart from these actions, the Italian battleships were not supposed to do anything else.
Now let's move on to Japan. Japan is an island country, as is Great Britain.
Submarines are ships designed to travel underwater and stay there for a long time.
Submarines were used during the First and Second World Wars. At the time, they were very slow and had a very limited firing range.
At the beginning of the war, they sailed mainly on the sea. But given the progress made in radar, and given their ever-increasing accuracy, submarines were forced to go underwater to avoid detection.
German submarines were called U-boats. The Germans were very good at navigating and handling their submarines.
Because of their success with submarines, after the war the Germans were not trusted to have many.
Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as "King All" or "The Child King," is one of the best-known ancient Egyptian monarchs of modern times.
It is interesting to note that it was not considered very important in antiquity and was not listed on most ancient lists of kings.
However, the discovery of his grave in 1922 made him a celebrity. While many tombs from the past have been looted, this tomb has remained virtually intact.
Most of the objects buried with Tutankhamun have been well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of spoked wheels made Assyrian tanks lighter, faster and better prepared to outrun soldiers and other tanks.
The arrows of their deadly crossbows could penetrate the armor of rival soldiers. Around 1000 BC, the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
A cavalry is an army that fights on horseback. The saddle had not yet been invented, so the Assyrian cavalry fought by climbing raw.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. But the most famous of all this civilization is probably Homer, the blind poet author of the two greatest masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems of the Iliad and the Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular playwrights, and their plays are considered among the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, best known for his famous theorem on the relations of the sides of right triangles.
Estimates vary as to how many people speak Hindi. It is estimated to be between the second and fourth most commonly spoken language in the world.
The number of mother tongues depends on whether or not closely related dialects are taken into account.
Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers, and up to 800 million people can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu have similar vocabulary but different script; In everyday conversation, speakers of both languages can usually understand each other.
Around the 15th century, northern Estonia was under strong Germanic cultural influence.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the natives; That's why they invented the literal Estonian language.
It was based on the German alphabet and a "Õ/õ" character was added.
Over time, many words borrowed from German have mixed. This was the beginning of development.
In the tradition, the heir to the throne did his military service after finishing his studies.
However, Charles went to university at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later, history, obtaining a 2:2 (a lower second-class degree).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to obtain a licence.
European Turkey (Eastern Thrace or Rumelia in the Balkan Peninsula) comprises 3% of the country.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1600 kilometers (1000 miles) long and 800 kilometers (500 miles) wide, with a more or less rectangular shape.
Turkey's area, including lakes, is 783,562 square kilometres, of which 755,688 square kilometres are in South-West Asia and 23,764 square kilometres in Europe.
Turkey's land area makes it the 37th largest country in the world and roughly equivalent to the size of metropolitan France and the United Kingdom combined.
Turkey is surrounded by seas on three sides: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence only dates back to 1839.
Some present-day parts of Belgium were once part of Luxembourg, but became Belgian after the Belgian Revolution of the 1830s.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country, but the territory was occupied by Germany during the First and Second World Wars.
In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the founding members of what is now known as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong is a ruined Buddhist fortress and monastery in the upper part of Paro District (in the village of Phondey).
It is said that in 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel created the fortress to commemorate his victory over the Tibetan-Mongol forces.
In 1951, a fire left only a few relics of the Drukgyal Dzong, such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress was preserved and protected, remaining one of Bhutan's most sensational attractions.
In the eighteenth century, Cambodia found itself wedged between two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the eighteenth century and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Phen.
At the end of the eighteenth century, the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those who are employed work in the informal economy.
Two-thirds of Venezuelans who work do so in the service sector, nearly a quarter in industry and one-fifth in agriculture.
An important industry for Venezuelans is oil, of which the country is a net exporter, although only one percent works in the oil industry.
In the aftermath of its independence, Singapore acquired expertise in the field of botanical gardens. This island state was later transformed into a tropical garden city.
In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, an orchid hybrid, was chosen as the nation's emblem flower.
Every year, around October, nearly 1.5 million herbivores head to the southern plains, crossing the Mara River, from the northern hills for the rains.
And then back to the north by the west, crossing once again the Mara River, after the rains around April.
The Serengeti region includes the Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania, as well as the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Learning how to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools mastered in interactive courses (storyboarding, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.).
Interactive design forces you to challenge your perception of media production and learn to think non-linear.
Interactive design requires that the elements of a project are interconnected, but also that they make sense as an independent entity.
The lenses of the zoom lens have a disadvantage. Indeed, the complexity of the focal length and the number of lenses required to obtain a range of focal lengths are much higher than those of fixed lenses.
This becomes less problematic as lens manufacturers reach higher standards in lens production.
This allowed zooms to produce images of a quality comparable to that obtained by fixed focal length lenses.
Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is usually lower.
This makes inexpensive zoom lenses difficult to use in low-light conditions without flash.
One of the most common problems when converting a movie to DVD format is overscanning.
Most televisions are made in a way that appeals to the general public.
For this reason, everything you watch on TV has the edges cut off at the top, bottom and sides.
It is therefore necessary to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. This is called overscanning.
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, its edges will probably be cut too, and if the video had subtitles too close to the bottom of the screen, they won't appear.
The traditional medieval castle has long stimulated the imagination, evoking images of jousting, banquets and Arthurian chivalry.
Even in the midst of millennial ruins, it is easy to remember the sounds and smells of distant battles, almost hear the rattling of hooves on the cobblestones, and feel fear rising from the pits of the dungeon.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built in the first place? How were they designed and built?
Typical of the time, Kirby Muxloe Castle is more of a fortified house than a real castle.
Its bay windows and thin walls could not have resisted a fierce assault for long.
In the 1480s, when its construction was initiated by Lord Hastings, the country was relatively peaceful and defence was only necessary against small bands of roving marauders.
The balance of power was a system in which European nations sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all European states.
The idea was that all European nations prevented a nation from becoming powerful, which is why national governments often changed alliances in order to maintain balance.
The War of the Spanish Succession marked the First War, the main outcome of which was the balance of power.
This marked an important change, as the European powers could no longer use the pretext of religious wars. Thus, the Thirty Years' War would be the last war to be qualified as a religious war.
The Temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BC. during an arson attack committed by Herostratus.
According to the story, his motivation was fame at all costs. The Ephesians, indignant, announce that the name of Herostratus will never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabo mentioned this name later and this is how it has come down to us. The temple was destroyed the same night that saw the birth of Alexander the Great.
Alexander, as king, offered to pay to rebuild the temple, but his offer was declined. Later, after Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE.
Check that your hand is relaxed as much as possible when you play each note correctly. Also, try not to make unnecessary movements with your fingers.
You would get less tired this way. Remember, there's no need to overemphasize the keys to make them sound louder. This is the case on the piano.
With the accordion, to produce more volume, operate the bellows by increasing the pressure or speed of movements.
Mysticism is the search for communion, the link with a deity or a god. It is the full awareness of a spiritual truth.
The believer seeks direct experience, intuition or revelation of divine reality/divinity or gods.
Followers pursue certain lifestyles, or practices that aim to nurture these experiences.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious worship and belief by its emphasis on the direct personal experience of a single state of consciousness, especially in the case of a peaceful, intuitive, happy, even ecstatic personality.
Sikhism is a religion of the Indian subcontinent, born in the fifteenth century in the region of Punjab, following a schism within the Hindu tradition.
Sikhs consider their faith to be a religion distinct from Hinduism, although they recognize its Hindu roots and traditions.
Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which means "guru's way" in Punjabi. The guru is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism he has taken on an importance that forms the core of Sikh beliefs.
The religion was founded in the fifteenth century by Guru Nanak (1469-1539). Nine other gurus followed one another.
However, in June 1956, Khrushchev's promises were put to the test when riots in Poland, where workers were protesting food shortages and wage cuts, turned into a general protest against communism.
Although in the end, Krushchev sent tanks to restore order, he gave in to certain economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
The Indus Valley Civilization is a Bronze Age civilization of the northwestern Indian subcontinent, which encompasses most of present-day Pakistan and parts of northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
This civilization flourished in the Indus basins, hence its name.
Some scholars, however, argue that since this civilization was also present in the basins of the now dry Sarasvati River, it should rightly be called the Indus-Sarasvati civilization, while some call it the Harappan civilization after Harappa, the first of its sites to be excavated, in the 1920s.
The militaristic nature of the Roman Empire contributed to the development of medical advances.
Emperor Augustus undertook to recruit doctors and even formed the first Roman medical corps to treat the victims of battles.
Surgeons were familiar with various sedatives such as morphine, the product derived from poppy seeds, and scopolamine, extracted from black henbane seeds.
They became experts in amputation by saving patients from gangrene, as well as in ligation pliers and arterial forceps to control blood flow.
Throughout the centuries, the Roman Empire has worked extensively in the field of medicine, and is the source of most of the knowledge we have today.
Pureland origami is origami with the constraint that only one fold can be made at a time, more complex folds like inverted folds are not allowed, and all folds have simple locations.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help people who are inexperienced or have limited motor skills.
Children become aware of race and racial stereotypes at an early age, and these stereotypes affect behaviour.
For example, children who identify with a racial minority that is usually perceived as underperforming in school tend to fail in school as soon as they discover the stereotype associated with their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website used in the United States and currently has 54 million profiles.
There has been a great deal of interest in these websites, especially in education.
These sites have beneficial sides, including being able to easily set up page types that include blogs, videos, photos, and other features.
This page is easily accessible from a single web address, making it easy to remember and write for students who don't know how to use a keyboard and have spelling problems.
It can be customized to make it easier to read, and you can put as much or as little color as you want.
Attention deficit disorder "is a neurological syndrome whose three characteristic symptoms are impulsivity, difficulty concentrating and hyperactivity (or excess energy)."
It is not a learning disability. It is a learning disability that affects 3 to 5 percent of children and affects nearly 2 million American children.
Children with ADD have trouble focusing on things like schoolwork, but they can focus on what they like to do, like playing games or watching their favorite cartoons or writing sentences without punctuation.
These are children who tend to have significant difficulties because they "engage in risky behaviours, fight and challenge authority" in order to stimulate their brains, since they cannot be stimulated by normal activities.
ADD affects relationships with other children, who cannot understand why sufferers act the way they do, why they spell the way they do, or why their maturity level is different.
As the ability to acquire knowledge and learn has changed in some way as mentioned above, the basic rate at which knowledge was acquired has changed.
The way to retrieve the information was different. There was no more pressure on individual memory, but the ability to remember a text became more important.
In sum, the Renaissance was at the origin of a major change in the way of thinking about learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Hominids no longer use their hands to walk, carry heavy loads or swing from one branch to another of a tree like other primates.
The chimpanzee's hand and foot are similar in size and length, reflecting the use of the hand to carry the weight in locomotion on the joints.
The man's hand is shorter than his foot, with stiffer phalanges.
The hand bones of a fossil, two to three million years old, reveal the mutation that the function of the hand underwent during the transition from locomotion to manipulation.
Some people think that doing many artificially induced lucid dreams quite often can be very exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of lucid dreaming that lengthens the time between REM sleep states.
With less REM sleep per night, this state in which you enjoy true restful sleep becomes rare enough to become problematic.
It's just as exhausting as waking up every twenty or thirty minutes and watching TV.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to dream lucidly per night.
Things took a bad turn for the Italians in North Africa almost from the beginning. A week after Italy declared war on June 10, 1940, the British 11th Hussars captured Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured the chief engineer of the Italian Tenth Army, General Lastucci.
On June 28, Field Marshal Italo Balbo, governor-general of Libya and Mussolini's potential successor, was killed by friendly fire while landing in Tobruk.
The modern sport of fencing is played at many levels, from students learning it at university to professional and Olympic competitions.
This sport is mainly played in a duel format, with one fencer fighting against another.
Golf is a game in which players use clubs to hit balls and send them into holes.
A game is usually played over eighteen holes: players usually start with the first hole of the course and end with the eighteenth.
The player who takes the fewest hits, or swings with the club, to finish the course wins.
The game is played on grass, and the grass surrounding the hole is cut shorter and called the "green".
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is the one most people associate with travel: recreational tourism.
This is the time when people go to a place, completely different from what he sees on a daily basis, to relax and have a good time.
Beaches, theme parks and campgrounds are often the most frequented places for leisure tourists.
If the purpose of visiting a particular place is to know its history and culture, then this type of tourism is called cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different sites in a given country or choose to focus on a single region.
The colonizers, having spotted this activity, had also called for reinforcements.
The troops reinforcing the forward positions included the 200-man 1st and 3rd New Hampshire Regiments, under Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both later generals).
Stark's men took up positions along the fence, at the northern end of the settler's position.
When low tide carved a gap along the Mystic River in the northeast of the peninsula, the barrier was quickly enlarged by a stone wall to the north ending at the water's edge on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark placed a stake about 30 yards in front of the fence and ordered no one to fire until the regulars crossed it.
The U.S. plan was based on launching coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder launched a diversionary attack on the British garrison at Bordentown to block any reinforcements.
General James Ewing had 700 militiamen cross the river at Trenton Ferry, captured the bridge over Assunpink Creek and prevented enemy troops from escaping.
The main assault force, consisting of 2,400 men, crossed the river nine miles north of Trenton, then split into two groups, one under Greene and the other under Sullivan, to launch an attack before dawn.
With the transition from 400 meters to 800 meters, speed becomes much less important and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, an excellent middle-distance runner, a man capable of breaking a record of two minutes must possess a good peak of speed, but above all a perfectly cultivated endurance.
A little cross-country in the winter, combined with indoor work for the upper body, is the best preparation for the racing season.
Good nutritional practices alone are not enough to guarantee elite performance, but they can have a significant impact on the overall well-being of young athletes.
Maintaining a good energy balance, adequate and regular hydration and good knowledge about the different aspects related to nutritional supplements can help athletes improve their performance and enjoy themselves even more in their sport.
Middle distance is a relatively inexpensive sport. The idea that it would require basic equipment is as false as most of the myths surrounding this sport.
Products can be purchased if the need arises, but most will have little or no real impact on the athlete's performance.
Athletes may feel that they prefer a product even if it does not bring any real benefit.
The atom can be considered to be one of the units that constitutes all matter.
It is a very complex entity that consists, according to a simplified Bohr model, of a central nucleus orbited by electrons, much like the planets orbiting the sun — see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus consists of two particles — neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electric charge while neutrons have no charge. Electrons have a negative electric charge.
Before examining the victim, ensure your safety by inspecting the premises.
You should notice the victim's position when approaching them and any obvious warning signs.
If you hurt yourself trying to help, you'll only make things worse.
The study found that depression, fear and catastrophism were at the root of the relationship between pain and disability in people with low back pain.
Only the effects of the disaster, not depression and fear, were conditioned by regular, structured weekly PA sessions.
Those who participate in regular activity need more support in terms of negative pain perception, distinguishing the differences between chronic pain and discomfort and normal physical movement.
Vision, or the ability to see, depends on the visual system, sensory organs, or eyes.
Ocular anatomy varies. They are ranked in order of complexity according to the requirements of the organization.
Different constructions have different capabilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths, and have different degrees of acuity. They also require separate processing for the interpretation of the data received and the numbers they need to function optimally also differ.
A population is the set of organisms of a particular species in a given geographical area.
When all individuals in a population are identical with respect to a particular phenotypic trait, they are said to be monomorphic.
When individuals have several variants of a particular trait, they are polymorphic.
Army ant colonies also walk and nest in different phases.
During the nomadic period, army ants walk at night and stop to camp during the day.
The colony enters a nomadic phase when the available food has decreased. During this phase, the colony builds temporary nests that are changed daily.
Each of these raids or raids lasts about 17 days.
What is a cell? The word "cell" comes from the Latin word "cella", which means "small room", and was invented by a microscopist who observed the structure of cork.
The cell is the basic unit of all living things, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.
In the study of life, cells are so essential that they are often considered the fundamentals of life.
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses through the body to keep blood flow both running and undisturbed.
These nerve impulses can be sent very quickly throughout the body, helping to protect it from any potential threats.
Tornadoes hit a small area compared to other severe storms, but they can destroy everything in their path.
Tornadoes uproot trees, tear planks from buildings and throw cars into the sky. The two percent of the most violent tornadoes last more than three hours.
These giant storms have winds of up to 480 km/h (133 m/s or 300 mph).
Man has been making and using lenses for enlargement for thousands and thousands of years.
However, the first real telescopes were manufactured in Europe at the end of the sixteenth century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses so that distant objects appeared both larger and closer.
Greed and selfishness will always be a part of us. It is natural in a cooperative relationship to earn more and quickly, by acting selfishly, when the majority has an advantage.
Hopefully, most people will realize that their best long-term option is to work together.
Many dream of the day when we can travel to another star and explore other worlds. For some, it's about what's out there, others believe that aliens or other life forms could live on another planet.
However, if that were to happen, it would surely not be for a very long time. The stars are so far apart that there are billions of kilometers between so-called neighboring stars.
One day perhaps, your great-grandchildren will find themselves on an alien world, wondering about their distant ancestors?
Animals are made up of many cells. They eat all kinds of things and digest them naturally. Most animals can move.
Only animals have brains (although not all animals have brains; jellyfish, for example, do not have brains).
Animals are found all over the Earth. They dig the ground, swim in the oceans and fly in the sky.
A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of a living organism.
Cell comes from the Latin word cella meaning small room.
If you look at living things under a microscope, you will see that they are made of small squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, an English biologist, saw small squares in cork with a microscope.
They looked like rooms. He was the first to observe dead cells.
Elements and components are able to move from one state to another without changing themselves.
Nitrogen in gaseous form retains the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is denser, but the molecules remain the same.
Water is another example. Water is composed of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.
It has the same molecular structure, whether it is a gas, liquid or solid.
Although its physical state may vary, its chemical structure remains constant.
Time is something that surrounds us and affects everything we do, and yet it is difficult to understand.
Time has been studied by religious, philosophical and scientific scholars for thousands of years.
We live time as a series of events that pass from the future to the past to the present.
Time is also a way to compare the duration (length) of events.
You can mark the passing of time yourself by observing the repetition of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is something that happens regularly.
Nowadays, computers are used to edit photos and videos.
Computers can generate complex animations, which are increasingly used in television and film.
Music is often recorded with sophisticated computers that allow sounds to be transformed and mixed together.
For a long time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori, who hunted giant birds called moas.
The theory then established the idea that the Maori people migrated from Polynesia in a Grand Fleet and took New Zealand from the Moriori, establishing an agricultural society.
However, new evidence suggests that the Moriori were a group of mainland Maori who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, developing their own distinct and peaceful culture.
There was also another tribe on the Chatham Islands: Maori who had migrated away from New Zealand.
They called themselves the Moriori, and after a few skirmishes, the Moriori were finally eliminated.
People who have been involved for several decades have helped us understand our strengths and passions while honestly assessing our difficulties and even failures.
By listening to individuals tell their personal, family and organizational stories, we were able to gain valuable insights into the past and some of the personalities who positively or negatively influenced the organization's culture.
While understanding someone's story is not synonymous with understanding their culture, it helps people know where they stand in the organization's history.
By evaluating successes and becoming aware of failures, individuals and all participants learn more deeply about the organization's values, mission, and guiding strengths.
In this case, remembering previous examples of entrepreneurial behavior and the resulting successes helped people open up to new changes and helped the local church take a new direction.
Such successes have reduced fears of change, while sparking positive trends towards future change.
Converging thought patterns are problem-solving techniques that unite different ideas or fields to find a solution.
This state of mind is based on speed, logic and accuracy, but also the identification of facts, the mobilization of pre-existing techniques and the search for information.
The most important factor of this state of mind: only one response is adapted. You only think of two options: either it's the right answer or it's the wrong answer.
This type of thinking is associated with certain scientific or standard procedures.
People with these types of thoughts have logical thinking, are able to memorize patterns, solve problems, and work on scientific tests.
Man is by far the most gifted species at reading the minds of others.
This means that we are able to anticipate, and not without success, the perceptions, intentions, beliefs, knowledge and desires of other humans.
Among these abilities, it is the ability to understand the intentions of the other that matters most. It allows us to resolve possible ambiguities posed by certain physical actions.
If you saw someone breaking a car window, for example, you'd probably think they're trying to steal a stranger's car.
He would have to be judged differently if he had lost the keys to his car, and if it was his own car that he was trying to force.
MRI is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (of Harvard University).
In this resonance, the magnetic field and radio waves cause atoms to emit tiny radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a medical doctor and scientist, discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, a patent was granted, which was the first patent in the world granted in the field of MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first full-body MRI scanner, which he called "the Indomitable."
Asynchronous communication promotes time for reflection and reaction to others.
This allows students to work at their own pace while controlling the speed at which pedagogical information is delivered to them.
In addition, there are fewer time restrictions with the possibility of working with flexible hours. (Bremer, 1998)
The use of the Internet allows apprentices to access information as often as they wish.
Students can also submit questions to instructors at any time of the day and expect reasonably quick answers, rather than waiting for the next in-person meeting.
Absolute freedom: this is what the post-modern approach to learning offers. There is no right way to learn that is unique in itself.
In fact, there is not a single good thing to learn. Learning takes place in the experience between the learner and the knowledge presented.
This point is illustrated by our current experience of all informative TV shows about DIY and learning.
So many of us find ourselves watching a TV show that shows us a process or experience that we will never participate in or put knowledge into practice.
We will never renovate a car, build a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to examine ancient ruins, or redo our neighbor's house.
Thanks to submarine fibre-optic cable links to Europe and broadband satellite links, Greenland is well connected and 93% of the population has access to the Internet.
Your hotel, guesthouse or private residence surely offers Wi-Fi or a computer connected to the Internet, while all places have an internet café or a place equipped with public Wi-Fi.
As mentioned above, while the word "Eskimo" remains acceptable in the United States, it is considered pejorative by many non-American Arctic peoples, particularly in Canada.
Although you may hear the natives of Greenland using the word, foreigners should avoid using it.
The indigenous inhabitants of Greenland are called Inuit in Canada and Kalaalleq (plural Kalaallit), Greenlandic, Greenland.
"Crimes or malicious acts in general, against foreigners are not common knowledge in Greenland. Even in the city, there are no 'risk areas'"
Low temperatures may be the only real danger faced by those who are unprepared.
If you're visiting Greenland during cold seasons (since as you venture north, the cold gets worse), be sure to pack clothes that are warm enough.
Long summer days can cause sleep disturbances and other health problems related to these disorders.
Also watch out for northern mosquitoes during the summer. Although they do not transmit any disease, their bite can be irritating.
Tourism occupies an important place in San Francisco's economy because of its international reputation, but in essence, its economic activities are diversified.
The main sectors of employment are professional services, government, finance, trade and tourism.
Its frequent representation in music, films, literature and popular culture has helped to make the city and its monuments known around the world.
San Francisco has developed a great tourist infrastructure with many top-notch hotels, restaurants and convention facilities.
San Francisco is also one of the best destinations in the country to experience Asian cuisine: Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
The trip to Walt Disney World represents an important pilgrimage for many American families.
The "typical" tour involves flying to Orlando International Airport, traveling by bus to a Disney on-site hotel, staying there for about a week without leaving the Disney facilities, and returning home.
There are endless variations, but that's what most people mean when they talk about "going to Disney World."
Many tickets sold online on auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are tickets valid in parks for several days but already partially used.
Although this activity is very common, it is prohibited by Disney: tickets are not transferable.
To camp below the Grand Canyon, you need a backcountry permit.
The permits, issued in limited numbers to preserve the canyon, are made available from the first of the month, four months before departure.
Thus, a backcountry entry permit for any start date during the month of May becomes valid on January 1.
Spots at the most popular spots such as the Bright Angel Campground, next door to Phantom Ranch, are usually filled by requests received on the first booking opening date.
Permits are limited in number and are reserved for those who arrive on site on a first-come, first-served basis.
Entering Southern Africa by car is an amazing way to see all the beauty of the region, as well as to get to places off the normal tourist routes.
This can be done in a normal car with careful planning, but a 4x4 is highly recommended and many places are only accessible with a long-wheelbase 4x4.
When planning, keep in mind that while Southern Africa is stable, not all neighboring countries are.
Visa requirements and fees vary from country to country, depending on the country you are from.
Each country also has unique laws requiring which first aid products should be in the car.
Victoria Falls is a town located in the western part of Zimbabwe, across the border from Livingstone, Zambia, and near Botswana.
The city is located right next to the falls, which are the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers adventure lovers as well as tourists plenty of opportunities for an extended stay.
During the rainy season (November to March), the volume of water will be higher and the falls will be more dramatic.
You're sure to get wet if you cross the bridge or walk along the trails that wind near the falls.
On the other hand, it is because the volume of water is extremely high that the view of the falls will be obstructed!
The tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). KV62 is perhaps the most famous of the Valley Tombs, the place where Howard Carter discovered the young king's nearly intact royal grave in 1922.
However, compared to most other royal tombs, Tutankhamun's tomb is hardly worth a visit, being much smaller and with limited decoration.
Anyone wishing to see the traces of damage to the mummy during attempts to remove it from the coffin will be disappointed because only the head and shoulders are visible.
The fabulous riches of the tomb are no longer present, but have been transferred to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Visitors with limited time would be better off spending it elsewhere.
Phnom Krom, 12 km from Siem Reap. This hilltop temple was erected at the end of the ninth century, during the reign of King Yasovarman.
The gloomy atmosphere of the temple and the view of the Tonle Sap Lake make the climb to the hill interesting.
A visit to the site can be pleasantly combined with a boat trip on the lake.
The Angkor pass is mandatory to enter the temple, so don't forget to take your passport when you go to the Tonle Sap.
Jerusalem is Israel's capital and largest city, although most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize it as such.
The ancient city of the Judean Hills has a fascinating history that spans thousands of years.
The city is holy to all three monotheistic religions – Judaism, Christianity and Islam – and serves as a spiritual, religious and cultural centre.
The religious importance of the city, and especially that of the many sites in the Old City, makes Jerusalem one of the top tourist destinations in Israel.
Jerusalem has many historical, archaeological and cultural sites as well as lively and busy shopping malls, cafes and restaurants.
Ecuador requires Cuban nationals to obtain a letter of recommendation before they can enter Ecuador through international airports or border crossings.
This letter must be legalized by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and comply with certain conditions.
These requirements are intended to ensure an organized migration flow between the two countries.
Cuban citizens with a U.S. green card must visit an Ecuadorian consulate to obtain a waiver of this requirement.
Your passport must be valid for at least six months beyond your travel dates. A return ticket is required to prove the length of your stay.
Tours are cheaper for larger groups, so if you're alone or with just one friend, try meeting other people and forming a group of four to six people to get a better rate per person.
However, this shouldn't worry you too much, as tourists are often mixed up to fill cars.
It seems to be a way of making people believe that they have to pay more.
This steep mountain, which dominates the northern end of Machu Picchu, often serves as a backdrop for many photos of the ruins.
It sounds a bit intimidating from below, and it's a steep and challenging climb, but the fittest people should be able to do it in about 45 minutes.
Stone steps are laid along most of the path, and steel cables provide a support ramp in the steepest sections.
That being said, expect to be out of breath and be vigilant in the steepest portions, especially in case of humidity, as this can go wrong very quickly.
Near the summit, you have to cross a small cave rather cramped and whose ceiling is quite low.
The best way to see the sites and wildlife of the Galapagos is by boat, as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships ply the waters of the Galapagos, ranging in size from 8 to 100 passengers.
Most people book their place well in advance (as boats are usually full during peak season).
Make sure the agent you book through is a Galapagos specialist with a solid knowledge of a wide variety of ships.
This will make it possible to find the vessel best suited to your specific interests and/or constraints.
Before the arrival of the Spanish in the sixteenth century, northern Chile was under Inca rule while the indigenous Araucanians (Mapuche) inhabited central and southern Chile.
The Mapuche were also one of the last independent American indigenous groups, which were not fully absorbed into Spanish-speaking rule until after Chile's independence.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (during the Napoleonic Wars that left Spain without a functioning central government for about two years), decisive victory over the Spanish was not achieved until 1818.
The Dominican Republic (República Dominicana in Spanish) is a Caribbean country that occupies the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti.
Apart from white sand beaches and mountain scenery, the country is home to the oldest European city in the Americas, which are now part of Santo Domingo.
The island was first inhabited by the Taínos and Caribs. The latter people spoke Arawakan; it would have arrived about ten thousand years B.C.
Within a few years of the arrival of European explorers, the indigenous Taino population had declined dramatically due to the Spanish conquistadors.
According to Brother Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias), between 1492 and 1498, the Spanish conquistadors killed about 100,000 Taínos.
Jardín de la Unión. This space was built as the atrium of a seventeenth-century convent, of which the Templo de San Diego is the only surviving building.
It now functions as the central square, and there is always a lot going on, day and night.
A large number of restaurants can be found around the garden, and free concerts are often held in the afternoons and evenings from the central kiosk.
Callejon del Beso (The Alley of the Kiss). Two balconies separated by only 69 centimeters are home to an ancient legend of love.
For a few coins, children will tell you the story.
Bowen Island is a popular day or weekend tour that features kayaking, hiking, shopping, dining, and more.
This authentic community is located in Howe Sound, right next to Vancouver, and is easily accessible by water taxis that depart regularly from Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.
For those who love outdoor activities, a hike in the Sea to Sky corridor is a must.
Whistler (an hour and a half drive from Vancouver) is expensive, but came to prominence thanks to the 2010 Winter Olympics.
In winter, enjoy some of the best ski slopes in North America, and in summer, enjoy authentic mountain biking tours.
Permits must be reserved in advance. You must have a permit to spend the night at Sirena.
Sirena is the only ranger station that offers dormitory accommodation and hot meals in addition to camping. La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos only offer camping pitches without catering service.
Park access permits can be obtained directly from the Puerto Jiménez ranger station, but credit cards are not accepted.
The park office (MINAE) does not issue permits more than one month before the scheduled arrival.
CafeNet El Sol offers a reservation service for $30, or $10 for a one-day package; learn more on their Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands archipelago is a state in free association with New Zealand, located in Polynesia, in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean.
It is an archipelago of 15 islands spread over 2.2 million square km of ocean.
With the same time zone as Hawaii, the islands are sometimes referred to as the "Hawaii of Oceania."
Although smaller, it reminds some elderly visitors of the island of Hawaii before it became a state with many large tourist hotels and amenities.
No city on the Cook Islands but they are made up of 15 different islands. The main ones are called Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
Today, in developed countries, the supply of luxury bed and breakfasts has been elevated to a kind of art form.
In the high-end, the guest rooms obviously compete mainly on two points: bedding and breakfast.
As a result, it is possible to find in the best establishments in this category extremely luxurious bedding, such as a handmade comforter or an antique bed.
Breakfast can include seasonal delicacies from the area or the host's specialty dish.
The setting could be an old historic building with antique furniture, manicured grounds and swimming pool.
Getting in your own car and going on a long trip has an intrinsic appeal in its simplicity.
Unlike large vehicles, you're probably already familiar with driving your car and know its limitations.
Setting up your tent on private property or in a city, regardless of size, can easily attract attention.
In short, using your car is a great way to take a road trip, but rarely in itself a way to "camp".
Camping by car is possible if you have a large minivan, SUV, sedan or station wagon with longer seats.
Some hotels retain their heritage dating back to the golden age of steam trains and transatlantic liners of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, before the Second World War.
These hotels were home to the wealthy and celebrities of the time, and they regularly hosted sumptuous dinners and superb receptions.
The old-fashioned layout, the absence of recent equipment and a certain old-fashioned charm are also part of their character.
Although they are mostly private, some sometimes host heads of state or other dignitaries.
The traveler who has considerable sums of money can consider a round-the-world flight, interspersed with stays in many of these hotels.
A hospitality exchange network is the organization that connects travelers with the inhabitants of the cities they are going to visit.
Joining such a network usually only requires filling out an online form; although some networks offer or require additional verification.
A list of available hosts is then provided either in print and/or online, sometimes with references and reviews from other travelers.
The company Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004 by computer programmer Casey Fenton, who had found a cheap flight to Iceland, but no base to stay there.
He emailed students at the local university and received an impressive number of offers of free accommodation.
Hostels cater mainly to young people – a typical guest is in their twenties – but there are also often older travellers.
Families with children are rare, but some hostels accept them in private rooms.
The city of Beijing in China will host the Olympic Winter Games in 2022, making it the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Games.
Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies as well as indoor ice events.
Other skiing events will take place at the Taizicheng ski resort in Zhangjiakou, about 220 km (140 feet) from Beijing.
Most temples hold an annual festival that begins in late November and ends in mid-May, which varies according to each temple's annual calendar.
Most temple festivals are celebrated as part of the temple's birthday, the deity presiding over it, or any other major event associated with the temple.
Kerala's temple festivals are very interesting to see, with frequent processions of decorated elephants, the temple orchestra, and other festivities.
An international exhibition (commonly known as a universal exhibition or simply an expo) is a major international festival of arts and sciences.
Participating countries organize art and educational exhibitions in their national pavilions to highlight global issues or their country's culture and history.
International horticultural exhibitions are specialized events that feature floral showcases, botanical gardens and everything related to plants.
Although they can theoretically take place every year (provided that it is in different countries), in practice this is not the case.
These events normally last between three and six months and take place on sites of at least 50 hectares.
There are many different film formats that have been used over the years. Standard 35 mm film (36 by 24 mm negative) is by far the most common.
It can usually be replenished fairly easily in case of exhaustion and offers a resolution roughly comparable to that of a current DSLR.
Some medium format cameras use a format of 6 by 6 cm, more precisely a negative of 56 by 56 mm.
This gives a resolution almost four times higher than that of a 35 mm negative (3136 mm2 against 864).
Wildlife are some of the most difficult themes for a photographer to capture, and require a combination of luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
Wildlife photography is often taken for granted, but as with photography in general, a picture is worth a thousand words.
Wildlife photography often requires a long telephoto lens. However, other scenes such as a flock of birds or a tiny creature require the use of other lenses.
Many exotic animals are hard to find, and parks sometimes have rules about taking photos for commercial purposes.
Wild animals can be shy or aggressive. The environment can be cold, hot or otherwise hostile.
The world has more than 5000 different languages, including twenty with 50 million speakers or more.
Written words are also often easier to understand than spoken words. This is especially true for addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce in an understandable way.
Many nations, as a whole, speak English fluently, and in many other countries one can expect to find partial knowledge of it, especially among young people.
Imagine, if you will, a Manchester resident, a Boston resident, a Jamaican and a Sydney resident, sitting around the same restaurant table in Toronto.
They feast on each other's stories from their hometowns, told with their pronounced accents and local slang.
Buying food in supermarkets is usually the cheapest way to eat. Without the possibility of cooking, however, choices are limited to ready-to-use foods.
Supermarkets increasingly offer a more varied range of ready meals. Some even provide a microwave oven or other means to heat food.
In some countries or types of outlets, there is at least one restaurant on site, often quite informal and affordable prices.
Make copies of your insurance policy and your insurer's contact information and take them with you.
They must present the insurer's email address and international telephone numbers for advice/authorisation and claims.
Have another copy available in your luggage and online (email addressed to yourself with attachment, or stored in the "cloud").
If you're traveling with a laptop or tablet, keep a copy in its memory or disk (accessible offline).
Also give copies of the regulations and contacts to travel companions and relatives or friends at home who are willing to help you.
Elks are not aggressive in nature, but will defend themselves if they feel in danger.
When people don't see moose as potentially dangerous, they can get too close and put themselves at risk.
Drink alcoholic beverages in moderation. Alcohol has different effects on everyone, and it is very important to know their limits.
Possible long-term health problems due to alcoholism include liver damage, but also blindness and death. The potential danger is increased when consuming illegally manufactured alcohol.
Illicit spirits can contain a variety of dangerous impurities, including methanol, which can cause blindness or death, even in small doses.
Prescription glasses can cost less abroad, especially in low-income countries where the cost of labor is lower.
Consider having your eyes examined at home, especially if your insurance covers it, and bring back the prescription that will then be filed elsewhere.
High-end branded frames sold in such parts of the world can present two problems: some may be fakes, and genuinely imported frames may be more expensive than in your country.
Coffee is one of the best-selling commodities in the world, and you can probably find many types of it in your home area.
Nevertheless, there are many ways to drink coffee around the world that are worth experiencing.
Canyoning (or canyoning) consists of going to the bottom of a canyon, which is either dry or full of water.
Canyoning combines elements of swimming, climbing and jumping, but requires relatively little training or fitness to start, compared to, for example, climbing, scuba diving or downhill skiing.
Hiking is an outdoor activity that involves walking in natural environments, often on hiking trails.
A day hike involves distances from less than a mile to longer distances that can be covered in a single day.
For a day hike on a gently challenging trail, it only takes a few preparations and anyone who is relatively healthy can enjoy it.
Families with young children may need more preparation, but it's possible to spend a day outdoors, even with babies and preschoolers.
Internationally, there are nearly 200 running tour organizations. Most of them operate independently.
Global Running Tours' successor, Go Running Tours, networks dozens of tourist jogging service providers on four continents.
Having its roots in Barcelona's Running Tours Barcelona and Copenhagen's Running Copenhagen, it was soon joined by Prague-based Running Tours Prague and others.
There are many things to consider before and while you travel.
When you travel, expect things not to be like "home." Manners, laws, food, circulation, housing, norms, language, etc. differ to some extent from where you live.
This is something you should always keep in mind to avoid disappointment or maybe even aversion to local behaviors.
Travel agencies have been around since the nineteenth century. A tour operator is usually a good option for a trip that goes beyond the traveler's previous experiences of nature, culture, language, or low-income countries.
While most agencies are willing to handle most regular bookings, many agents specialize in more specific types of trips, price ranges, or destinations.
It may be best to hire an agent who frequently books trips similar to yours.
Take a look at the trips the agent promotes, whether on a website or in a storefront.
If you want to see the world cheaply, out of necessity, lifestyle or challenge, there are a few ways to do it.
Basically, they can be classified into two categories: either you work during your trip, or you try to limit your expenses. This article focuses on the latter category.
For those willing to sacrifice comfort, time, and predictability to keep expenses down to near zero, check out the minimum budget trip.
This advice assumes that travellers do not steal, enter a public place, participate in the illegal market, beg or exploit others for their own benefit.
An immigration checkpoint is usually the first step when you disembark from a plane, boat or other vehicle.
On some cross-border trains, inspections are conducted on the moving train and you must carry valid identification with you when travelling on one of these trains.
On sleeper trains that run at night, passports can be collected by the conductor so as not to interrupt your sleep.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa procedure. In some countries, you must register and indicate the address of your place of stay with the local authorities.
This may require filling out a form with the local police or a visit to immigration offices.
In many countries with such a law, local hotels will take care of the check-in themselves (don't forget to ask).
In other cases, only persons residing outside tourist accommodation need to register. However, the law is much more obscure, so it will be necessary to inquire beforehand.
Architecture refers to the design and construction of buildings. The architecture of a site is often a tourist attraction in its own right.
Many buildings are rather pleasant to look at, and the view offered by large buildings or cleverly placed windows can be strikingly beautiful.
Architecture overlaps considerably with other fields, including urban planning, civil engineering, decorative arts, interior design, and landscaping.
Given the remoteness of many pueblos, you won't be able to find significant nightlife without heading to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, almost all of the casinos listed above serve drinks, and several of them offer high-quality entertainment (mainly the large casinos located near Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Beware: small-town bars here aren't always good places to hang out if you're a foreign visitor.
For one thing, northern New Mexico has significant drunk driving problems, and the concentration of drunk drivers is high near small-town bars.
Unwanted murals or doodles are known as graffiti.
While it's far from a modern phenomenon, most people probably associate it with young people vandalizing public and private property using spray paint.
Today, however, there are recognized graffiti artists, events dedicated to the discipline and "authorized" surfaces to indulge in it. Under these conditions, graffiti more often looks like real works of art than vulgar indecipherable tags.
Boomerang throwing is a popular skill that many tourists want to learn.
If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang that flips directly into your hand, then make sure you have a boomerang designed to come back.
In reality, most of the boomerangs available in Australia are not coming back. It is better for beginners not to try to make throws in the wind.
A hangi meal is cooked in a hot pit dug into the ground.
The pit is either heated with hot stones from a fire, or geothermal heat naturally warms certain areas of the soil.
Hangi is often used to prepare a traditional roast-style dinner.
Several locations in Rotorua offer geothermal hangis, while other hangis can be sampled in Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
MetroRail offers two classes on commuter trains in and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also known as first class) and Metro (also known as third class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and less crowded, but more expensive, while still cheaper than the normal price of metro tickets in Europe.
Each train has Metro and MetroPlus cars; MetroPlus cars are always at the end of the train closest to Cape Town.
Wear for others – never lose sight of your bags, especially when crossing international borders.
Someone could use you to transport drugs without your knowledge, which would get you into big trouble.
This includes waiting in line, as drug-sniffing dogs can be used at any time without notice.
In some countries, penalties are extremely draconian, even for first offences; They can go as far as prison sentences of more than ten years or the death penalty.
Unattended bags are a target for theft and can also attract the attention of authorities who are wary of bomb threats.
At home, due to this constant exposure to local germs, the chances are very high that you are already immune to them.
But in other parts of the world, where bacteriological fauna is new to you, you are much more likely to encounter problems.
In addition, in warmer climates, bacteria grow faster and survive longer outside the body.
Thus the plagues of Delhi Belly, the curse of the pharaoh, the vengeance of Montezuma and their many friends.
As with respiratory problems in colder climates, intestinal problems in warm climates are quite common and, in most cases, are particularly troublesome but not really dangerous.
If you're traveling for the first time to a developing country or a part of the world you don't know, don't take the possible culture shock lightly.
Many stable and skilled travelers have been overwhelmed by the novelty of traveling to developing countries, where many small cultural adjustments can quickly add up.
Especially in the beginning, consider splurging on Western hotels, food, and style and quality services to help you acclimatize.
Do not sleep on a mattress or cushion on the floor in areas where you do not know the local wildlife.
If you are going camping, bring a cot or hammock to keep away from snakes, scorpions and others.
Fill your home with the aroma of intense coffee in the morning and evening, with that of a relaxing chamomile herbal tea.
When you're on a stay, you have time to treat yourself and take a few extra minutes to prepare something special.
If you're feeling more adventurous, take the opportunity to make a juice or mix smoothies:
Perhaps you'll discover a simple drink that you can make for breakfast when you return to your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a varied drinking culture, go to bars or pubs in neighborhoods you don't frequent.
For those unfamiliar with medical jargon, the words "infectious" and "contagious" have distinct meanings.
An infectious disease is one caused by a pathogen, such as a virus, bacteria, fungus or other parasites.
A contagious disease is a disease that is easily transmitted when in close proximity to an infected person.
Many governments require that visitors entering their country or residents leaving their country be vaccinated against a range of diseases.
These requirements can often depend on the countries a traveler is visiting, or intends to visit.
One of the strengths of Charlotte, North Carolina is the abundance of high-quality services for families.
Residents of other areas often cite family friendliness as the main reason for settling in, and visitors often find the city easy to enjoy with children nearby.
Over the past 20 years, the number of kid-friendly options in Charlotte's business district has grown exponentially.
Families generally do not use taxis in Charlotte, although they can be useful in some circumstances.
There is a surcharge for having more than two passengers, so this option could be more expensive than necessary.
Antarctica, which surrounds the South Pole, is the coldest place on Earth.
Sightseeing is expensive, requires good physical condition, can only take place in summer (November to February) and is largely limited to the peninsula, the islands, and the Ross Sea.
A few thousand employees live here in summer in about forty bases, mainly in these regions; A small number of them stay in winter.
Inner Antarctica is a desolate plateau covered with 2 to 3 km of ice.
Specific and punctual air expeditions inland, for mountaineering or to reach the Pole, with a vast base.
The South Pole Highway is a 1,600 km highway between McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea and the Pole.
It is compacted snow, with filled crevices marked by pennants. It can only be covered by specialized tractors, pulling sleds carrying fuel and supplies.
The latter are not very agile, so the track must make a long swerve around the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plateau.
In winter, the most common cause of accidents is the slippery nature of roads, sidewalks and especially steps.
Shoes with adequate soles are the minimum. Summer shoes very often slide on ice and snow, even some models planned for winter are no exception.
The pattern must be deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 in.) or more, and the material must be flexible enough in cold weather.
Some boots have studs and there is additional studded equipment for slippery conditions, which is suitable for most shoes and boots, for heels or heels and sole.
Heels should be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) is often scattered on roads or paths to improve traction.
Avalanches are not anomalous phenomena; Steep slopes can only hold a small amount of snow, the excess of which spreads in the form of avalanches.
The problem is that the snow sticks, so if it collapses, there has been a trigger. However, a slight collapse of snow can be the trigger for everything else.
Sometimes the trigger is solar warming on the snow, sometimes it's just more snow, and other times it can be natural events or human activity.
A tornado is a column-shaped low-pressure vortex of air, the surrounding air is drawn in inwards and upwards.
They generate strong winds (often 100 to 200 miles per hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air, carrying them as the tornado moves.
They start as funnels descending from storm clouds, and become "tornadoes" when they make landfall.
Personal VPN (virtual private network) providers are a great way to bypass both political censorship and commercial IP geofiltering.
They are superior to web proxies for several reasons: they redirect all online traffic, not just http.
They normally offer greater bandwidth and better quality of service. They are encrypted and therefore more difficult to spy.
Media companies routinely lie about the purpose of this measure, claiming that it aims to "prevent piracy."
In fact, area codes have absolutely no effect on illegal copying; A bit-by-bit copy of a disc works great on any device where the original can be played.
The real goal is to give these companies greater control over their markets; It's about making money.
Since calls are routed over the internet, you do not need to use a telephone company located where you live or travel.
It is also not mandatory to obtain a local number from the community in which you live; you can get a satellite internet connection in the wilds of Chicken, Alaska, and select a number that indicates you're in sunny Arizona.
Often, you need to purchase an international number that allows calls in RCTP. Where your phone number is located is important to the people who call you.
Real-time translation applications are apps that can automatically translate entire segments of text from one language to another.
Some of the apps in this category can even translate foreign language texts written on signs or other everyday objects when the user points their smartphone at them.
Translation engines have improved considerably, and now often give more or less correct translations (and more rarely gibberish), but you have to be careful, because they may still have everything wrong.
One of the most reputable apps in this category is Google Translate, which allows offline translation after downloading the desired language data.
Using GPS navigation apps on your smartphone can be the easiest and most convenient way to travel outside your country of residence.
It can save money by buying new maps for a GPS or standalone GPS device, or by renting one from a car rental company.
If you don't have a data connection on your phone, or if it's out of range, its performance may be limited or unavailable.
Every corner store is filled with a confusing array of prepaid phone cards that can be used from payphones or regular phones.
While most cards allow you to call anywhere, some specialize in offering advantageous rates for specific groups of countries.
Access to these services is often through a toll-free number that can be called toll-free from almost any phone.
The rules regarding regular photography also apply to video recording, or even more.
If it is forbidden to take a simple photo of something, do not even think about recording a video.
If you are using a drone, check well in advance what you are allowed to film and what additional permits or licenses are needed.
Flying a drone near an airport or over a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it's not illegal in your area.
Nowadays, it is rare for people to book their flight directly through the airline without first researching and comparing prices.
The same flight can sometimes have large price differences between aggregators; Before booking, it is therefore advantageous to compare the search results as well as consult the website of the airline itself.
If you do not need a visa for short-term stays in certain countries as a tourist or for business travel, going there as an international student usually requires a longer stay than that of a simple tourist.
In general, to stay in a foreign country for a long period of time, you must first obtain a visa.
Application procedures and student visa requirements are generally different from those of standard tourist or business visas.
For most countries, you will need a letter of acceptance from the institution where you wish to study, as well as proof of sufficient funds to support yourself at least during the first year of your course.
For details of the conditions, see the institution and the immigration service of the country in which you wish to study.
Unless you're a diplomat, working abroad usually means you'll need to file the income tax return in the country you're based in.
Income taxes are structured differently in different countries, and tax rates and brackets vary widely from country to country.
In some federal countries such as the United States and Canada, income tax is levied at both the federal and local levels, so tax rates and brackets may vary from region to region.
While immigration control is usually absent or a formality upon arrival in your home country, customs control can be a source of hassle.
Make sure you know what you can and can't bring, and declare anything that exceeds legal limits.
The easiest way to get started writing travel articles is to hone your skills on a well-established travel blog.
After, and only after mastering formatting and online review, you can create your own website.
Volunteering while traveling is a great way to make a difference, but it's not just about giving.
Living and volunteering in a foreign country is a great way to experience a different culture, meet new people, get to know yourself, gain new perspectives and even new skills.
It can also be a good way to stretch a budget to allow for a longer stay somewhere, as many volunteer jobs offer room and board and some pay a small salary.
The Vikings used Russian waterways to reach the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Parts of these routes can still be used. Check for the possible need for special permits, which can be difficult to obtain.
The White Sea Canal connects the Arctic Ocean with the Baltic Sea, via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and St. Petersburg, passing mainly through rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to the Volga, so it is still possible to come from the Caspian Sea via Russia.
Rest assured: once you reach the marinas, everything will be clear. You will meet other hitchhikers, who will share their information with you.
Basically, you'll post ads to offer help, walk the docks, approach people cleaning their yachts, try to get to know sailors at the bar, etc.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. After a while, everyone will know you and give you directions on the boat that is looking for someone.
You should choose your Frequent Flyer airline carefully as part of an alliance.
Even if you think it's intuitive to join the airline you fly with the most, you should know that the privileges offered are often different and that the loyalty points system can be more generous with another airline of the same alliance.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have greatly expanded their offerings in Africa, and offer connections to major African cities at competitive rates compared to other European airlines.
In 2014 Turkish Airlines flies to 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have more time to travel, compare the total ticket price to Africa with the price of a ticket to go around the world.
Don't forget to add additional fees for visas, departure taxes, ground transportation, etc. for all these places outside Africa.
If you want to fly around the world only in the southern hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations will be limited due to the lack of transoceanic routes.
There is no airline alliance covering the junctions of the three oceans of the southern hemisphere (and SkyTeam does not cover any of them).
However, Star Alliance covers everything but the eastern South Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is a LATAM Oneworld flight.
This flight is not the only option if you want to avoid the South Pacific and the west coast of South America. (see below)
In 1994, Azerbaijan's ethnically Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh region waged a war against the Azeris.
With the support of Armenia, a new republic was created. However, no established nation, not even Armenia, officially recognizes it.
Diplomatic incidents in the region continue to tarnish relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The canal district (Grachtengordel in Dutch) is the famous seventeenth-century district that surrounds Amsterdam's Binnenstad.
The entire district is a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique cultural and historical value, and real estate prices are among the highest in the country.
Cinque Terre, which means Five Lands, includes the five small coastal villages of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso in the Italian region of Liguria.
They are inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Over the centuries, people have carefully built terraces across the rugged and steep landscape to the cliffs overlooking the sea.
Part of its charm lies in the lack of visible business development. Paths, trains and boats connect the villages, and cars from outside cannot access them.
The variants of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland differ slightly from the French spoken in France, although they are similar enough to be mutually intelligible.
The numbering system of French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland has some small features that differ from the French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of some words is slightly different.
Nevertheless, all Belgians and French-speaking Swiss would have learned standard French at school, so they would be able to understand you even if you used the standard French numbering system.
In many parts of the world, waving is a friendly gesture meaning "hello."
On the other hand, in Malaysia, at least among rural Malays, it means "come this way", like bending the index finger towards you, a gesture used in some Western countries, and it should only be used in this sense.
Similarly, a British traveler to Spain might mistake a farewell sign made by a person turning the palm of their hand toward themselves (rather than the person to whom they are addressing the sign) with an invitation to return.
Auxiliary languages are languages, artificial or constructed, created for the purpose of facilitating communication between peoples who would otherwise have difficulty communicating.
They are distinct from vehicular languages, which are natural or organic languages that become dominant for one reason or another as a means of communication between speakers of other languages.
With the heat of the day, travelers may spot mirages that give the illusion of water (or other things).
These can be dangerous if the traveler pursues the mirage, wasting valuable energy and remaining water.
Even the hottest of deserts can get extremely cold at night. Hypothermia is a real risk if you don't have warm clothes.
It is especially in summer that you will have to watch out for mosquitoes if you plan to hike in the rainforest.
Even if you're driving in the rainforest, a few seconds with the doors open as you get into the vehicle is enough for mosquitoes to get into the vehicle with you.
Avian influenza, or more formally avian influenza, can infect both birds and mammals.
Fewer than a thousand cases have been reported in humans, but some have been fatal.
Most involved people who work with poultry, but there is also some risk for bird watchers.
The fjords and steep valleys that suddenly give way to a more or less regular high plateau are typical of Norway.
These trays are often called "empty", to designate a vast space without trees, an expanse without limits.
In Rogaland and Adger, they are often referred to as "hei", which means deforested moors often covered with heather.
The glaciers are not stable, but break away from the mountain. This causes cracks, crevices, which can be obscured by snow bridges.
The walls and roofs of ice caves can collapse and cracks close.
At the edge of the glaciers, huge blocks break off, fall, and perhaps bounce or roll away from the edge.
The tourist season of the mountain resorts usually peaks during the Indian summer.
However, their beauty and charm change in winter, with many mountain resorts providing good amounts of snow and offering activities such as skiing and snowboarding.
Only a few airlines still offer mourning fares, which slightly reduce the cost of last-minute funeral travel.
Airlines that offer them include Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights from the United States or Canada, and WestJet.
In any case, you must book by phone directly with the airline.
