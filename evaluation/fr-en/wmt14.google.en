The NSA affair highlights the complete absence of debate on intelligence
How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand takes offense in public by summoning the ambassador of the United States on October 21, and on the other prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the rumor of the presence on board of Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande telephones Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the United States Ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is that of the extent of American surveillance of all communications in France.
Isn&#39;t it surprising to read in the columns of Le Monde a few weeks apart on the one hand the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a condemnation of the tapping of the Quai d&#39;Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn&#39;t there be a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on the analysis by American diplomacy of political or other issues throughout the world, we consider that, with regard to American power, this constitutes an important light.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is in no way to be indignant at this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Did France benefit from information provided by the NSA concerning terrorist operations targeting our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of American collaboration?
The establishment for roughly ten years of very powerful technological interception tools by the United States, but also by France, has officially been justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this field, France and the United States in particular have set up procedures for cooperation and exchanges of information on an almost daily basis, which are described by both sides as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French thanks to the means of the NSA.
France may be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to American services, and, in return - as we have already quickly said - the Americans can give information to the French on other regions of the world.
So the basic question behind this NSA affair is not so much the ability or the right of countries to equip themselves with interception tools, as the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly within Parliaments, on the justification for such systems, the scope that should be theirs, and, ultimately, the question of violations of freedoms.
What is the United States really risking? a degradation of their image?
We may denounce them, but I don&#39;t see how they can be punished.
The risk run by the Americans may be twofold.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest level of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been strained.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in the light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to American service providers subject to American laws, and therefore to the influence of the NSA.
Last element: the vast movement of revelations initiated by the media around the world, which is helping to trigger a debate on the surveillance practices of intelligence services that has hitherto been almost non-existent, could push legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers that they gave to their intelligence services.
Barack Obama receives the Iraqi Prime Minister, in the midst of an outbreak of violence
The American president was to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, seeking help from the United States to fight against the strongest wave of violence for five years.
Iraq experienced its deadliest month in five and a half years in October, according to figures released Friday (November 1st) by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The UN gives an even higher toll with 979 dead and 1,902 injured.
This violence is increasingly deadly despite reinforced security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the Shiite-dominated government of Nouri Al Maliki.
The total death toll in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of American troops, the level of violence raises fears of a new conflagration while neighboring Syria is in the grip of a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot in the street or even in their homes, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and of being the target of unjust arrests, has favored this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, the day after the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five car bombs north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been blamed on the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaeda (Sunni extremists), also involved in Syria&#39;s civil war.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a &quot;world war&quot; against Al-Qaida.
Violence is at the center of talks in the United States of Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki who will be received by President Barack Obama on Friday, two years after their previous meeting on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the American president, elected on the promise to put an end to the military engagement in this country, had painted an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive and elected members of Congress.
Thursday, he pleaded for the international community to wage a &quot;Third World War&quot; against Al-Qaeda.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, attributing to him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his &quot;sectarian and authoritarian policy&quot;.
They also demanded that Barack Obama make it clear to Nouri Al Maliki that &quot;the pernicious influence of Iran within the Iraqi government constitutes a serious problem in our bilateral relationship&quot;.
French police will arrest Anderlecht supporters who came other than with RSCA buses
The French police have decided to lay down strict rules concerning the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain scheduled for Tuesday, communicated Marie Verbeke, the spokesperson for the Brussels-Midi police zone, on Friday.
Belgian RSCA supporters who want to go to this Champions League match must use the travel system put in place by the RSCA.
&quot;The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former border post in Rekem to the PSG stadium,&quot; the spokeswoman said.
The procedure will be the same for the return.
&quot;If other supporters had the intention of going to Paris by other means, the French police headquarters have made it known that measures have been taken allowing arrests or even police custody&quot;, further announced Marie Verbecke.
The Vatican probes into contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken to conduct a major survey around the world on how parishes handle sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asks participants how priests care for gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together outside the bonds of marriage.
The survey was sent out in mid-October to each national bishops&#39; conference, with instructions to get as many responses as possible.
The information will be used at a major family gathering that Pope Francis plans to hold next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokeswoman for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide how appropriate to survey parishioners.
In the UK, bishops posted the survey on the internet asking Catholics to participate.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy School in Surrey faces six charges, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan has been charged with hostage taking, forcible confinement, uttering threats, carrying a weapon for a dangerous purpose, kidnapping, and failure to comply with an order.
&quot;The quick reactions of the police officers involved and their ability to de-escalate the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident,&quot; Corporal Bert Paquet said in a press release.
Omar Hassan is still in custody and is due in court on Friday.
The new nicotine vaccine could suppress the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction for life.
More testing is needed before human trials begin, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said early signs were encouraging.
“We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all the methods available on the market today, but find that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to make anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
The antibodies track down all the nicotine molecules present in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker from getting his nicotine fix.
During the tests, the vaccinated mice who were then given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But the mice that hadn&#39;t been vaccinated &quot;felt quiet,&quot; the researchers said, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines were found to be ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so frequently to keep antibody levels high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing any addiction to nicotine.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit.
&quot;They will know that if they start smoking again, they won&#39;t enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it may help them break their bad habit,&quot; he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but warned that much more research was needed.
Egyptian Islamists take to the streets to denounce Morsi&#39;s trial
Anger is brewing in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the opening of the trial of deposed President Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the reinstatement of the country&#39;s first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial underlines this militant of the Muslim Brotherhood.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It&#39;s not a trial, it&#39;s a joke.
The trial of President Morsi is a bogus trial protests a pro-Morsi, it is he who is supposed to put Sisi on trial, not the other way around.
Morsi must try Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, the Nahda massacres, and the Republican Guard massacre.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes erupted in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police will be deployed in front of the Cairo police academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in Val-d&#39;Oise
The authorities announced Thursday, October 31 that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d&#39;Oise, obviously of foreign origin while France has been free of native cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
“An epidemiological investigation has been initiated in order to identify and take care of the people who could have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28 inclusive,” specifies the ministries of health and agriculture.
&quot;Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified&quot; and received preventive treatment.
&quot;In humans, preventive treatment for human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the appearance of symptoms, is very effective,&quot; the statement said.
The ministries are now calling on people who have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or on damaged skin by this kitten or whose animal would have been in contact with this kitten between October 8 and 28 to contact on 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from November 1st.
&quot;France being free from rabies since 2001, this kitten or the mother were imported from another country, not free&quot;, according to the press release.
The Ministry of Agriculture specifies that the last &quot;autochthonous&quot; case of rabies recorded dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that &quot;France was declared officially free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE)&quot; .
A case of rabies in a dog illegally imported from Gambia was recorded in 2008.
“Rabies is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time”, recall the ministries and it is transmissible for nearly 15 days before the appearance of the first symptoms of the disease.
the Pont-de-Buis portico dismantled
The Pont-de-Buis eco-tax gantry, around which a violent demonstration by opponents of this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled on Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived on site shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national was diverted in stride.
The decision to dismantle, announced by the prefecture of Finistère on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, manager of the gantry.
This is the last of the three eco-tax gantries in working order in the department of Finistère, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Australian woman appeals jail sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days in Phuket for falsely claiming she was assaulted by a taxi driver, has appealed against the judgment and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty in a Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 of making false statements after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who overpowered her, had assaulted early on Sunday, June 10.
However, CCTV footage later revealed she had returned to her hotel safely after splitting from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she admitted to fabricating the story.
She was detained in a cell at the local police station before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention center on the outskirts of Phuket rather than a women&#39;s prison.
It is the daughter of former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Foreign Office in Canberra to help his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family were &quot;extremely concerned&quot; for their daughter&#39;s well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
“We obviously had a nerve-wracking time, but we hope to get her home safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after posting 50,000 baht bail.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi region in southern Thailand.
Thai court sources said Bamford was being represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned the appeal could lead to an increased sentence of up to two years in prison and incarceration in an adult prison. .
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand may also seek to repair its damaged image among tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.
Google, Samsung and Huawei face lawsuits over Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of old Nortel patents launched a flurry of patent lawsuits on Thursday against cellphone makers including Google, the company it beat to the post in the sale to patent auction that took place after the bankruptcy of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the United States Court of Assizes States in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of infringing seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that make it possible to display advertising related to Internet search terms, the trial&#39;s findings said, which is Google&#39;s core business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be reached.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that run Google&#39;s Android operating system, which competes fiercely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel&#39;s patents.
Google increased its offer several times, finally offering $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patents to Rockstar, Google later acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal partly based on Motorola&#39;s patent library.
“Although unsuccessful in its attempt to acquire the patents at issue during the auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe said patents,” said the conclusions of the lawsuit.
Rockstar is seeking greater damages from Google for claiming that Google&#39;s patent infringement is willful, according to the plaintiff.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labor minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state&#39;s anti-corruption regulator.
Former NSW minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing commercial lease policy at the behest of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties in the government-controlled area.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday widened its investigation into whether Mr Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeids own two restaurants and a cafe, after their expiry in August 2005, without there having been a call for tenders.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid&#39;s secret interest in the properties, following testimony from Mr Tripodi&#39;s former deputy general secretary, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During years of discussions that began in 2005, the government pushed for the leases to be put out to tender.
Tenants were against it and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009, leases for businesses in Circular Quay, which brought in the Obeids about $2.5 million a year, were renewed without a call for tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favor of calls for tenders.
But he denied changing his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid who, Mr. Tripodi admitted, was calling for a change in government policy on leases.
Transcripts of telephone conversations presented to the ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had come to the Ports Department after working under Mr. Obeid at the Ministry of Fisheries.
“Was the subject discussed during these telephone conversations the development of commercial lease policy? asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy of Mr. Tripodi.
“No,” replied Mr. Tripodi.
I don&#39;t remember what we discussed but in any case, it was not about that.
In any case, certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not make a call with their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices door-to-door to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not talk on their cellphones – under much-anticipated new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers shouldn&#39;t expect any immediate changes.
How quickly the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their planes meet the new guidelines and that they have updated crew member training manuals and aircraft stowage rules to comply.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their planes.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
&quot;Depending on the plan, we may approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon,&quot; the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They&#39;re not supposed to turn them back on until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives the go-ahead.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their devices when getting off the plane before landing and not turn them back on until the plane has touched down.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are properly shielded from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their devices during takeoffs, landings and taxis, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified so passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was pleased with the changes.
“Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will be working closely with carriers on this – it will benefit everyone,” Glading explained in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like “room attendants” when it comes to this issue.
But it will still be prohibited to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and text messages or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will need to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was loudly kicked off an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the device was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will still need to be put away because they could hurt someone if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be prohibited.
Regulatory authority regarding cell phones rests with the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
FAA May Lift Ban on Certain Electronic Devices During Takeoff and Landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert on CBS News, said cellphones were still considered a risk.
“Cell phones are a real problem, not only because they could potentially interfere with navigation instruments, but because we know from the FCC that they could interfere with cell phone towers. if used on board,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government allow broader use of personal electronic devices.
Pressure on the FAA has grown in recent years to loosen restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid security reason for these bans.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce as device use has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least a third of passengers forget to turn off their devices, or do so deliberately.
The FAA began limiting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communications instruments when passengers carried FM radios, the high-tech gadget of the day.
The new airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to resist electronic interference and FAA approved.
Airlines have allowed their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners are expected to allow wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today&#39;s electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices are downloading or sending data.
Amazon.com is among those pushing for an easing of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, company executives loaded an airliner with Kindle e-book readers and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This inspired members of the FAA&#39;s advisory committee with mixed feelings about whether or not using the devices poses a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed interference from devices was real, although the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that the devices can interfere with an aircraft&#39;s systems, and most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to ask passengers to turn off their devices during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense arrangements for tech-equipped travellers.
&quot;We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety,&quot; said Roger Dow, president and director of the US Travel Association.
Rules regarding the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia for the time being.
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing despite a move by the United States to ease regulations on electronic devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for US carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their aircraft during critical phases of flight provided that they are in &quot;airplane&quot; mode.
Passengers can already do this for most of the flight, but many people find it a pain not to be able to access their eBooks during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the ruling that requires US carriers to do significant work to meet the requirements, but said they have no immediate plans to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia.
“CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices on airplanes,” she said.
The issue is subject to regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, which has already spoken to CASA about plans to expand use of its in-flight entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change but said it would follow the regulator.
“We would welcome a CASA review that would allow the use of electronic devices as we really believe it would improve the customer experience now that we have (the in-flight entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft” , said a spokesperson.
Qantas said it was abiding by the current rules for the time being.
&quot;As per our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no immediate plans to change this,&quot; she said.
The FAA decision applies to US airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will closely examine the FAA&#39;s decision and the reasons for it.
For US carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will need to demonstrate that their planes can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and instructions provided to passengers.
“Once an airline has verified its fleet tolerance, it may allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes,” the FAA said. .
In the rare event of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be stowed safely under seats or in overhead bins during takeoff and landing.
CDC releases childhood allergy guidance for schools
On Wednesday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a set of guidelines on how to handle children&#39;s food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines the US government is issuing, as the number of school-aged children with food allergies has soared.
One in 20 children in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of childhood food allergies increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to educate faculty and staff about food allergies in children, and how to treat them if an allergic reaction occurs.
He also recommends schools have a stock of epinephrine – the EpiPen-branded auto-injector being the most commonly used – so they can respond quickly to life-threatening anaphylaxis.
State legislatures recently updated regulations to make it easier for schools to stock epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, &quot;I feel like something is tingling my tongue,&quot; &quot;I feel like there&#39;s a hair on my tongue,&quot; or &quot;I feel like my tongue is tingling.&quot;
Much Opposition to Physician-Assisted Dying at Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favor of the principle of the bill on medical assistance in dying in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to ease their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would want to end their lives, according to a spokesperson for the Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association. , Maryse Bouvette.
If the emphasis were on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would become minimal.
The president of the Palliative Care Network of Quebec also rejects the bill on medical assistance in dying.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is worried about the consequences for future generations.
“What is the meaning of life?” she laments.
The majority of hospices will refuse to help patients die, according to Alliance of Hospices Vice President Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be useless anyway.
We are never asked: &quot;I want to die, give me an injection&quot;.
Ontario Hospice Palliative Care Association director Rick Firth believes Quebec&#39;s bill confuses people about the purpose of hospice palliative care.
He doesn&#39;t believe Ontario will follow suit.
For her part, the Liberal MP for Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, affirms that the notion of end of life will have to be clarified before the bill is adopted.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late, and dress up around the neighborhood.
Today, I have become more stingy.
For the past two years, I haven&#39;t handed out a single piece of candy, and I certainly won&#39;t do so again this year.
But the stats show that I&#39;m the black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million in fact – will be celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to every Halloween party are the trends.
Costumes are expected to account for $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, sexy inanimate objects are all the rage.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizza, burgers, and carrots.
As for the men, I expect to see plenty of zombies, thanks to The Walking Dead TV series, and I bet Daft Punk&#39;s space men will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there&#39;s nothing wrong with staying traditional.
We dressed up our dogs last year and to my amazement they weren&#39;t the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
That&#39;s a lot of curious dogs dressed as hotdogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don&#39;t mess around.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents approximately 272 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
That&#39;s great news for the 41 million kids who go candy hunting in their neighborhoods, according to the US Department of Commerce.
In fact, we are going to buy and, let&#39;s face it, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Candy corn is the only thing we don&#39;t want to eat; yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
That&#39;s about 9 billion kernels of corn.
It&#39;s a mystery that I haven&#39;t been able to solve yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, like &#39;Terror Behind the Walls&#39; (which is actually a real prison), &#39;Howl-O-Scream&#39; and &#39;The House of Shock&#39;.
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, which generate around $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those awesome photos of you peeing on yourself that your friends put on Facebook that you can&#39;t remove and a guy you like leaves a &quot;nice face&quot; comment on.
Finally, let&#39;s talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin into a lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – it&#39;s something we&#39;ve been doing since we were little.
Luckily for us, the “baby pumpkin trend” only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us sculpted these pumpkins and didn&#39;t have to sit in them.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The jack-o&#39;-lanterns gently withering on your front porch probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.

School transport: the complaint deemed admissible
Since the beginning of the school year, the Commission scolaire de la Région-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) has charged a fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students benefiting from school transportation for two residences, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Prior to the changes made in the last budget, no financial contribution was requested.
“There is a mediation service offered by the commission and I was interested,” explains Ms. Lefèvre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to a mediation and she asked for additional time to think about it.
&quot;It&#39;s always better to talk about it, to consult and find solutions,&quot; said Ms. Lefèvre.
The Commission scolaire de la Région-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) declined to comment.
The organization has only meant that mediation is part of the process when a complaint is filed.
DRC: the army attacks the last stronghold of the rebels
The diehards of the M23, a few hundred fighters, were entrenched at an altitude of nearly 2,000 meters on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two localities located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu.
&quot;It hasn&#39;t stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night,&quot; a resident of Jomba told AFP, contacted by telephone around 12:30 p.m., and according to whom a girl was shot and injured in the morning.
&quot;The intensity of the clashes has diminished a bit&quot;, he added, &quot;it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have pushed back the rebels a bit&quot;.
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had &quot;spent the night&quot; in Jomba before going to the front for a &quot;mopping up operation&quot;.
We could very clearly hear behind him the crackling of small arms.
From Bunagana, a political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear the detonations of heavy weapons.
According to a source at the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the DRC, the fighting has entered &quot;a final phase&quot;, the FARDC having &quot;surrounded the residual M23 positions to dislodge them&quot;.
Since the resumption on Friday of clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army, MONUSCO has not participated directly in the fighting, but it has provided government troops with decisive support in terms of intelligence, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, were climbing towards the front line.
They were armed with Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana, a border post with Uganda, soldiers helped by civilians were loading a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new FARDC truck, to take over from another pounding machine. the positions of the M23 on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila called again on Wednesday evening for the rebels to &quot;voluntarily demobilize&quot; on pain of being disarmed &quot;by force&quot;, but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been discussing since December without result for the moment.
On the spot, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
&quot;We have finished the talks, it only remains for Ugandan mediation to organize the signing,&quot; said Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the M23 delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed by the government.
The M23 was born of a mutiny in April 2012, former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which Kigali and Kampala refute.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions in the DRC, and its subsoil is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where around 5,000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday according to the UN, the return movement to the DRC which had started in the morning was reversed at midday. .
&quot;This morning we crossed back to go to our fields, but the soldiers told us to fall back,&quot; Imelda Nyirankusi told AFP, surrounded by her nine children, including an infant on her back.
One has the impression that the shots are getting closer to the populations.
In the early evening, dozens of residents crossed the border, some with mattresses over their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
Israeli army kills Hamas operative in Gaza-sces
Israeli tank fire on Thursday killed a Palestinian Islamist Hamas militant and seriously injured another in the southern Gaza Strip, health service sources said.
A Hamas source said fighting broke out in the area as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli army was content to evoke a &quot;targeted action&quot; in the area near a tunnel qualified as &quot;terrorist&quot; by the Jewish state, dug on the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Security concern in Mozambique grows as clashes erupt between powerful figures
At the feet of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, looking down at them, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chant peaceful slogans in a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace to return; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment firm.
Worried about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes for a T-shirt reading &quot;we want security&quot; in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered in the capital&#39;s Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there were almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, the worst skirmishes since the peace accord was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, supported initially by white-ruled Rhodesia and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country&#39;s independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not fall back into open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
Much is at stake for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50bn in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
Frelimo, the party in power and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo mutually blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo says the government is behind the recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in Sofala province, a traditional Renamo stronghold, on October 17.
The assaults on the former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group&#39;s leader, and Fernando Mazanga, Renamo&#39;s spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government holds Renamo responsible for starting the conflicts, and accuses it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to downplay concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself a “loser” who wanted to use “all the strength he had left to try to prove that he could impose its decisions to the government.
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But concern grew after Mr Mazanga said Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace accord.
He told the FT he meant the deal was no longer being honored by Frelimo.
“We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have failed to ease tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
&quot;These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who keep arguing with each other,&quot; said Joseph Hanlon, an Open University lecturer and specialist in Mozambique.
None of them know how to negotiate well and none of them are ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favor of electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections due to take place in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to extract concessions and a war chest from the government.
Renamo&#39;s vote share has been falling steadily since 1992, while a new party, the Mozambican Democratic Movement (MDM), which was created by a former Renamo member, is expected to win more votes in elections.
Mr Mazanga said Mr Guebuza – who is expected to step down at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
&quot;He doesn&#39;t want multi-party democracy, he doesn&#39;t want transparent elections, he doesn&#39;t want peace because he doesn&#39;t want to leave the presidency,&quot; Mazanga said.
It&#39;s unclear exactly what Renamo&#39;s capacity is, but it has carried out disruptive blitzkriegs on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway.
Most of the skirmishes took place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but home to Beira, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal .
In June, Rio was unable to use the railroad for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the rail line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to &quot;warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique&quot;, Mazanga said.
The instability has heightened frustrations with the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent spate of kidnappings.
“People think that the responsibility for the future of the country is the government and the president, and that it is up to the latter to find solutions to the problems,” he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protester, said people just wanted stability.
“Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want to have free access to the roads,” he added.
Pia: at least four injured in a violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday evening.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a crowd of around thirty people according to the testimonies collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a brawl involving several people broke out on the side of the Post Office.
At least four minor injuries are to be deplored.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Pastor charged with child pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who cared for young people in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia is accused of child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested Friday morning following searches of his home and the National Research Council office where he works.
The Timberlay Baptist Church, where the pastor officiated, says it is deeply saddened by this news.
In a statement, church officials say Mr Hudgins has resigned from his post.
The pastor was released on conditions.
In particular, he must not communicate with people under the age of 18 and must not access the Internet.
He will appear in provincial court in Halifax in December.
Coulson used phone hacking to check out a pipe
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson reportedly used &quot;phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation&quot; to try to confirm a bogus tip about an affair involving then-incumbent Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke was having a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his &quot;pretty special adviser&quot;.
It was reported to the court that the newspaper instructed Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack into Pawlby&#39;s voicemail and &#39;permanently plant outside her door&#39;, but Coulson also called her and left messages for her. vocals.
&quot;The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of man to stand outside people&#39;s houses hoping to surprise them, he is the kind of man to like to present the story to people to see what they say about it,” Mr. Edis said.
He said NotW uses three means to investigate the subjects: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, surveillance, it cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He says the opposite, but we say &quot;Of course if&quot;.
Rumors of an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by NotW&#39;s editorial office when a source, feeling sexually attracted to Miss Pawlby, said he had been told: &#39;Don&#39;t waste your time on her , she is with Charles. »
A tape, on which voicemail messages hacked into his phone were recorded on at least three occasions, was seized from Mulcaire&#39;s home in August 2006.
Investigators also found entries on the private detective&#39;s computer which related to Miss Pawlby and her sister stored in a &#39;Projects&#39; folder.
During the period the detective was investigating her, Miss Pawlby&#39;s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr Edis added.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw surveillance of Miss Pawlby&#39;s every move.
In a voicemail he left her on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, &quot;I have a story we&#39;re planning to publish tomorrow that I&#39;d really like to tell Charles about. »
Mr Edis explained that Coulson&#39;s involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other prominent men, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he was dating co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to having carried out telephone hacking.
$325 million bailout for Tasmania&#39;s healthcare system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million bailout for the ailing health care system comes with stringent conditions aimed at ensuring the state government won&#39;t waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking &quot;urgent action&quot; to end a crisis caused by the island state&#39;s aging population, high rate of chronic disease and system constraints. .
The funding, planned over 4 years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state,” Ms Plibersek said today.
The $325M plan includes a $31M campaign for elective surgeries.
2,600 additional operations, notably in the field of orthopedic and cataract surgery, will help to catch up.
Funds are also provided for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better outpatient care, training of medical executives, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
&quot;These investments respond to the idea that frontline clinicians believe this is the best way to heal Tasmania&#39;s healthcare system,&quot; said Ms Plibersek.
The minister said the Tasmanian government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on where it is spending the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides services in the most effective and efficient way possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that the $325m will not count for much &#39;unless it is followed by real reform to strengthen Tasmania&#39;s public health system&#39;.
He nevertheless praised the government for having responded to the urgent request for help it presented to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“I hope the federal relief package will go a long way in getting Tasmania&#39;s public health system off the blacklist,” Mr Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional elective procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But Opposition Health Critic Peter Dutton believes today&#39;s announcement is &quot;a band-aid solution&quot;.
&quot;The reason we&#39;re here is because the state Labor government took $430 million out of their health care system,&quot; he said on ABC TV.
You can&#39;t have a state government gouging out almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth putting in $300 million, and pretending it&#39;s a lucky day.
Mr Dutton has visited Ms Plibersek to ensure that no bailout dollar will be spent on additional bureaucracy.

Dr. Georges Bwelle delivers free health care to villages in Cameroon
Dr Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him, or any of the other 10 heroes, to be named &quot;CNN Hero of the Year&quot;.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate between periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and visit hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but he contracted an infection which spread to his brain, creating a hematoma which he would carry with him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, getting him whatever treatment he could get.
“It&#39;s not easy,” adds Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5 a.m., rush to the hospital to be the first, and you&#39;re not the first.
There are many patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr Bwelle&#39;s father in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only 1 doctor for every 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor for every 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not afford the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of the country&#39;s health expenditure is carried out in the private sector.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” explained Dr Bwelle.
And due to poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After watching his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to turn things around.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed more than 700 surgeries free of charge over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaoundé.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with around 30 people, they pile into vans after fixing medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult terrain to reach the villages that need the most help.
Luck does not always follow them.
They have repeatedly had to push the vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: the community throws a party, sings and dances and offers them the best accommodation available.
In these villages, free healthcare is cause for celebration, and Dr Bwelle – with his big smile and boundless energy – is more than happy to join in the festivities.
The next morning, the team begins seeing hundreds of patients.
&quot;We get 500 people on each visit,&quot; Bwelle said.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this mobile hospital, various health care services are provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, a collected pair of glasses or a free birth certificate – a document needed to attend school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgical procedures under local anesthesia.
The operations are generally carried out in a school, a town hall or a house; after the procedure, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery room to make way for the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It&#39;s a grueling pace, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
&quot;They bang on drums all night to keep us awake so we can keep working,&quot; Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work they have accomplished.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has performed 700 surgeries for free over the past year, and they know their presence can make all the difference to those they help.
A man explained that the free operation he underwent for a hernia would allow him to work again.
“It will change my future and that of my family,” the man said.
In addition to supporting this mobile hospital and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical practices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, which finances 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don&#39;t know when he&#39;s sleeping,” said Katie O&#39;Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer with Dr. Bwelle&#39;s group.
He is still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association to be able to carry out these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O&#39;Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle on his assignments, it&#39;s a hands-on learning opportunity they don&#39;t need. do not have at home.
“We were able to participate in operations to help mop up the blood or pass the instruments to Dr Bwelle,” said Miss O&#39;Malley.
It&#39;s not something you get to do in America when you&#39;re a sophomore medical student.
Student volunteers generally pay for their journey to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their board, transport and education are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
&quot;He&#39;s a hero, there&#39;s no doubt about it,&quot; said Katie O&#39;Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not about to die out.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Helping others live happily ever after by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
&quot;I&#39;m so happy when I do this job,&quot; Mr. Bwelle added.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I&#39;m doing.
Making people laugh and relieving pain are the reasons why I do this.

Additionally, the Defender Challenge will feature a day of training and testing in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
The two Frances of Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and situate Pierre Nora.
Teacher in lecture halls and classrooms?
No doubt, but emphasizing his weakness for side roads, Sciences-Po, Hautes Etudes.
Arbitrator of the works of others in his office on rue Gaston-Gallimard?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the editor.
Heir to the chair that Fontenelle occupied at the French Academy?
Certainly again, but knowing that such a consecration could not replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, which has been dispensed with.
They willingly recognized in him a great awakener, animator and unifier of their work, but pointed out that he showed little inclination to produce any himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of &quot;Places of memory&quot;, to which he attached his name, also contributed.
Nasty tongues were able to see a gigantic flea market there, presented by an intelligent commentator, endowed with a keen eye and loaded with erudition, but incurably dilettante.
The two books published by Nora almost two years ago have already established that the one who was considered not to write had written a lot and well.
This book should definitely do it justice.
Yet we find there, once again, the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagrancy, the jubilation of jumping as if with both feet from one subject to another.
But we quickly understand that the disparate objects gathered in this book with such a beautiful title bring the second-hand dealer to one and the same passion: that of discovering the core of French identity.
Why these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: it is a preoccupation of the times.
Recently, we were collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders at the time, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the affair, Jacobinism obliges, was entrusted to the prefects and the sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora is tracking is quite different.
He does not pose as heir to an eternal Frenchness, he refuses definition.
An analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he wanders in a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by an object in the form of a rebus, tormented by irritating questions.
Including this one, which is born of the company itself: why, in a country so permanently established within its borders, so anciently structured and solidly built, do we hear these dramatic calls for unity?
They are only so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, to ward off the trouble born of the discords of French history.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very old.
And the most emblematic is obviously the one that splits national history in two.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two histories and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without succeeding in denying it; anxious, on the contrary, to rediscover its sacredness and all the more eager for unity and indivisibility in that it had cut off the head of the one who was its obvious and powerful incarnation.
And, from there, an invincibly binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution.
To make this singularity of French identity felt, nothing beats four steps outside France, so much so that Pierre Nora&#39;s American escapade could well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But the American cousinhood only better underlines what is unique to us.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, encumbered men of an indigenous Old Regime, and all the more radical.
There a consensual revolution when here it has sown drama and confit.
There founding fathers always honored, and here revolutionary ancestors whom it is difficult to make models, and who moreover killed each other.
There an institutional constancy, and here a cascade of constitutions, like so many mistakes to make up for and attempts to repeat.
The France that is leaving, the France that is coming
There was, however, a time when the French believed they could mend the torn dress of their history, and overcome the curse of the number two.
At this Third Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed great interest and even tenderness: saluting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching schoolchildren everything that in old France obscurely prepared modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity only had a time.
Here it is again in debate, jostled by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of protesting minorities, absorbed in the European space.
The book therefore offers both a fascinating portrait of the France that is leaving and a circumspect sketch of the France that is coming.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve some surprises.
We discover that the tramp was a homebody.
The man of multiple curiosities revolved, slightly obsessively, around the same idea.
The Edge Prowler stood in the center of the center.
And the one who, more than half a century ago, had submitted a subject on the idea of nation, but had withdrawn from the initiatory exercise of the thesis, confides to us, cum grano salis, that he will have finished by doing it.
Certainly in a less stiff, more fragmented and more subtle form.
But make no mistake, just as binding.
Because much more than the imposed figure of the university curriculum, this thesis speaks of the inner necessity of a life.
How biometrics will invade our lives
No more passwords to type in to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French and Japanese researchers are predicting a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of telephones and computers.
Bernard Didier, deputy general manager of Morpho, even believes that &quot;the century will be biometric&quot;.
Only biometrics will make it possible to ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a universe as transverse and transnational as the Internet.
Organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this enthusiasm for biometrics, but are concerned about it.
In 2011 alone and in France, the National Commission for Computing and Liberties authorized 774 systems for recognizing fingerprints, the shape of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens ...
“Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and anytime,” says Justin Brookman, head of consumer privacy at the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, among some, and pessimism, among others?
Biometrics will rely on new techniques, which will provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data are fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its limitations.
&quot;For example, some people who work with concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are illegible&quot;, observes Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity field at Thales Communications &amp; Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand suppose a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
This is both a security - one cannot capture this data without their knowledge - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been carried out for around twenty years on other approaches, such as face or iris recognition (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to the increase in the precision of the sensors and the computing capacity of the computers necessary for the analysis of the data, these techniques are becoming operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has increased tenfold over the past five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture&#39;s R&amp;D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the UK and Holland have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
&quot;Today, we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but it requires a quiet environment,&quot; said Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel. Labs.
A unique and tamper-proof marker, DNA also arouses hopes and concerns.
&quot;In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data&quot;, confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of studies, innovation and forecasting at the CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very time-consuming and very expensive.
NEC offers the judicial police services a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in one hour.
The uses of biometrics fall into two groups: identification (recognizing a person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is who they claim to be).
Identification has so far concerned the issuance of identity papers: biometric elements (fingerprints, photo, iris) must be compared with the information that the State has on all citizens already on file.
This helps ensure that a person does not attempt to impersonate someone else.
This principle of comparison can have other applications.
NEC thus offers VIP recognition at the entrance to a hotel or shop.
“We collect images from surveillance cameras and compare them to photos of celebrities that circulate freely on the Internet,” explains Dany Nassif, in charge, at NEC France, of business development for biometric identification solutions.
Another use: take a picture of someone queuing in a store, follow their progress using facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication initially concerned physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens, etc.) or logical access (opening a computer).
Added to this, more recently, is presence control.
&quot;A biometric time clock avoids the phenomenon of the buddy who points for another&quot;, justifies Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also concern transactions, in particular those carried out from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from certain ATMs by inserting your card and placing your hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces typing the secret code.
A similar technique is being tested in Villeneuve-d&#39;Ascq and Angoulême by the company Natural Security in partnership with banks and large retail chains: when paying in stores with their bank card, the customer does not enter their code , but inserts his finger into a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is scheduled to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French traders.
Ways to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics appealing to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
&quot;If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in the checkout thirty seconds less, it&#39;s appreciable&quot;, explains the director of a supermarket.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you tailor-made options.
And, finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect the databases.
&quot;Fingerprints are stored on a first server; people&#39;s identities are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which is blocked if you try to move it&quot;, enumerates Philippe Robin, from Thales.
But, for lack of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know whether these discourses really convince users.
Privacy experts continue to worry.
&quot;Advances in facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the enormous amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance&quot;, predicts Andrew Patrick, of the Office of the Commissioner for Protection of privacy in Canada.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines is considering charging up to $100 for passengers carrying carry-on luggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for carry-on baggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday it said passengers could take the unopened can with them to the descent from the plane.
The new hand baggage fees are for bags stowed in the overhead compartment, so smaller bags fitted under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if fees were paid up front and $100 if travelers paid only once at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O&#39;Malley said the $100 was intended to entice travelers to pay the fee upfront.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to charge that price,&quot; she explained.
Airlines began charging for first and second checked bags in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these fees put as much as they could into the carry-on baggage stowed in the overhead compartments, so there was often no room left in these compartments.
These fees are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O&#39;Malley said these new fees won&#39;t really be used to raise money.
This is to make the most loyal Frontier customers understand that it is becoming more and more difficult to find space in the overhead compartments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline&#39;s website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger queuing at a Frontier gate could carry a bag for free, while the next person in line might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O&#39;Malley explained that Frontier&#39;s check-in site and procedures are changing to ensure passengers are aware of these charges before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier&#39;s carry-on baggage fees will not be applied until the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often grumble about baggage fees and other fees, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are significant and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Yet many of them have not touched the baggage fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first carry-on baggage fees three years ago, and low-cost airline Allegiant followed suit a little later.
The only other company imposing such a fee is Hungarian carrier Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who tracks surcharge fees closely.
He estimated, in a December 2011 report, that Spirit&#39;s carry-on baggage fees brought in $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, traveled on Spirit recently and wondered what he would find at the gate as passengers learned about the company&#39;s unusual carry-on baggage fees.
&quot;I&#39;ve never seen such a smooth boarding process in my entire professional career,&quot; he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the door.
The plane was full, he added, &quot;passengers boarded at lightning speed&quot;.
Frontier also does like Spirit and charges a $2 fee for a coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said passengers taking a soda or juice can take the unopened can with them, and those taking coffee can get a refill for free.
She will always distribute free water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008 but backtracked seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier&#39;s decision to charge carry-on baggage fees when passengers don&#39;t purchase tickets directly from the airline is its latest effort to drive customers to its site.
Airlines pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of going to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began offering only half frequent flyer miles to customers who purchased their ticket through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut mileage awards by 25% on one trip.
For example, a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown of Denver, but its business is shrinking and it is losing money.
Revenue fell 9% and its flight capacity shrunk nearly 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic attempted to straighten out Frontier&#39;s finances by selling the airline.
Scientists have just shed light on how a dog&#39;s tail movements are linked to his mood.
Previous studies have found that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog&#39;s perspective), while nervous dogs wag their tails more to the left.
But now scientists say dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from the University of Trento, said: &quot;Everyone knows that in humans the left side and the right side of the brain are involved in different ways in the stimuli that arouse emotions. positive or negative. »
Here we tried to see what it was like in other species.
He added that similarly to humans, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to disorderly tail movements from other dogs, researchers followed animals watching movies that featured other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It surely won&#39;t be long before we figure out why their tails sometimes go one way and sometimes the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: &quot;We showed dogs movies that had other dogs in them - either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other confounding factors - and we were able to manipulate the tail movement and show it like going more left or right. »
When the animals saw an expressionless dog wagging its tail to the right (from the perspective of the dog wagging its tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail swerving mostly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog wagging its tail), their heart rate spiked and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Rather, he thinks dogs know from experience which movements they should and shouldn&#39;t be concerned about.
He added: &quot;If you repeatedly encounter other dogs and notice that most of the time their tail wagging to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right side results in a less friendly, you will react according to this experience. »
The researchers say the results could help owners, veterinarians and trainers better understand their pets&#39; emotions.
Canine behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the University of Bristol&#39;s School of Veterinary Science, clarified that this was not the first study to examine the importance of left and right in dogs. canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog.
And in another scientific study carried out by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Dogs went more easily towards a robot dog when its tail was wagging to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – l opposite of what appears in the Italian study. »
He said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies didn&#39;t fully view the animals in the movies or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he said.
“While there is a lot of evidence from different mammals that indicates that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, there are still many details that need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception,” he said. .
However, given how easily their behaviors can be recorded, it surely won&#39;t be long before we understand why their tails sometimes move to one side and sometimes to the other.
Launch of an accessory store for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of connected glasses signed Google.
They can thus acquire an earphone, a charger or even a storage case.
This store, strictly reserved for developers who already have Google Glass, offers a few accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a protective cover made of micro-fibers or an in-ear earphone.
Although Google is currently working on a model of Google Glass equipped with corrective lenses, no full-scale release date has yet been confirmed.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This is what motivated, a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and education staff, to think about ways to better integrate students who live between several cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of &quot;Living together in French&quot;.
The Vision Diversity organization has been going to schools for a year to help students of all origins discover common landmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are benchmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether native or from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
“So we create projects so that they identify with all that,” explains the president of Diversity Vision, Aïda Kamar.
Michel Venne, from the Institut du Nouveau Monde, identified several challenges for the school board.
“On the transmission, for example, of what Quebec culture is, the feeling of belonging, support for staff in the transformations that we are experiencing, within the student clientele,” he lists.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board has created a research center that will provide tools to teachers who, sometimes, also come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
Preparing to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
&quot;Different pedagogical strategies, that&#39;s the real need&quot;, she summarizes.
Research will focus on inclusion from all angles: linguistic, academic, social and cultural.
Obama ends eavesdropping on IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to put an end to the tapping it practiced on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, said an American official on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House&#39;s attempt to regain control of the NSA wiretapping affair after revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that the surveillance of the IMF and the World Bank by the intelligence agency has been mentioned since the start of the scandal.
Asked about the subject, an official of the American administration replied: &quot;the United States does not carry out electronic surveillance targeting the headquarters of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington&quot;.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official did not say whether such surveillance had been in place in the past.
Another official said that Barack Obama had given orders to stop these practices in recent weeks.
This instruction was given around the same time as the one ending the tapping of UN headquarters in New York.
Against that backdrop, the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday approved tighter controls on government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The commission introduced new restrictions on the data intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a five-year limit on the retention of such information.
European stock markets down at mid-session, except London
With the exception of London, the main European stock markets are moving down on Friday mid-session, weighed down by some disappointing company news, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
Moreover, investors remain cautious as they believe that the US Federal Reserve could unwind its quantitative easing policy sooner than expected.
Conversely, after the announcement of inflation at 0.7% for the whole of the euro zone, the idea is spreading among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy .
Wall Street futures point to an opening for US equities higher, after two consecutive sessions of decline.
In values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the largest decline in the CAC 40, weighed down by the profit warning from its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, after having also published lower results this morning and announced the internal creation of a bad bank 38 billion pounds of riskiest assets.
For its part, Vodafone (+2.45%) remains at the top of the increases of the EuroFirst300 in reaction to press information that AT&amp;T is studying a possible takeover bid.
On the foreign exchange market, speculation on the evolution of the ECB&#39;s monetary policy is rife, as evidenced by John Hardy, strategist at Saxo Bank.
The ECB&#39;s single mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week&#39;s meeting.
We anticipate strong downside potential for the euro.
In this context, the euro continues to fall against the US currency and hit a two-week low in session at 1.3517 dollars.
These same conjectures conversely support the bond market in the euro zone.
This judgment means that a text of law adopted in July in this State and largely questioning the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
Classical singing for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five sketches imagined and performed by artists from the region, vignettes with a strong dose of humor, we allow teenagers to tame classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Société d&#39;art lyrique du Royaume will return with its Lyric Destinations, a formula that is now sold out at the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two other concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving artists from the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
Added to these activities was the Lyric Apéro, the benefit concert held last August, with the help of coloratura soprano Marie-Ève Munger.
It was a fundraising activity, alongside the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization produce a financial statement that is as sweet to the ears as a tune from The Bat.
Without providing specific figures, the chairman of the board of directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future is looking good, even in the long term.
We have more solid and constant support.
&quot;Finances are afloat and we hope to last until the operetta&#39;s 50th anniversary, a milestone we will reach in seven years,&quot; commented the administrator.
&quot;I would even say beyond that,&quot; added general manager Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
Congolese army chases M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced Thursday that its units would pursue the rebels of the M23 to their bases located in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears on the verge of being beaten after being driven out of localities in the north-east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) which it has controlled since the start of the insurgency 20 months ago.
&quot;We are going to pursue the M23 and corner them wherever they hide because they are criminals,&quot; FARDC spokesman Colonel Olivier Hamuli told Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize because they have been torturing the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, political leader of the rebellion, affirmed on RFI that these military setbacks would in no way modify his demands for the peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed on Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and the M23.
Clashes are reported in the hills overlooking Bunagana, the last locality in the hands of the insurgents to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion was born in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the flight of the government garrison and the passivity of the blue helmets of Monusco.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of manpower, to strengthen its mandate and form a rapid intervention brigade made up of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC staff was reshuffled and the army went on the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The rate of advance of government troops is now unprecedented.
&quot;The M23 seems to be coming to an end,&quot; predicts an expert on Congolese affairs, Jason Stearns, on his Congo Siasa blog.
It would be historic - it would be the first time that the government in Kinshasa had succeeded in defeating a major insurgency.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied to Rwanda would be present in eastern DRC.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda, which fiercely denies it, of supporting the M23 militarily, initially made up of former Congolese soldiers who mutinied.
British Foreign Minister William Hague urged Rwandan President Paul Kagame to exercise restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
Last week, Kigali raised the possibility of military reprisals following the shells that fell on Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana took to the streets of the town to greet the entry of FARDC soldiers.
&quot;We lived for a year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to us that one day we would be liberated by the army&quot;, testifies a resident of this locality bordering Uganda.
&quot;We lived in terror (of the M23), we are traumatized&quot;, added this man.
John Kerry admitted in unprecedented fashion that US espionage &#39;had gone too far inappropriately&#39;
John Kerry has signaled a softening of the defensive attitude of the United States towards its surveillance programs by admitting, in an unprecedented step, that on several occasions espionage &quot;has gone too far inappropriately&quot;. .
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had been on &quot;autopilot&quot; when a series of inflammatory revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities emerged.
The leaks put the US government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said: &quot;It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have learned about some things on autopilot because that we had the possibility, from the Second World War until the difficult years of the Cold War, and then of course 9/11. »
He then became the first high-ranking member of the United States government to admit that American espionage had overstepped the mark, but insisted that everyone&#39;s rights had not been violated.
He said: “In some cases it went too far inappropriately. »
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make it clear to people that he was now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels cheated.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Mr Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We live in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up. »
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We did prevent planes from falling, buildings from blowing up and people from being murdered because we were able to learn the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns over the alleged U.S. espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counterterrorism efforts with the United States, it said on Thursday. Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about threats they had made about a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations in because of frustration with National Security Agency surveillance.
“It is truly important to the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain with us in mutual engagement in the fight against terrorism,” said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and president of the US Senate European Affairs Subcommittee, in an interview from Washington.
And I&#39;m going to Europe to make it clear to them that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programs.
The press reports that the NSA has intercepted millions of communications in Europe, which has damaged relations with some allies of the United States, however the director of the agency said this week that this was inaccurate and that this was a misunderstanding as it involved metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations included documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from German Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s mobile phone and those of 34 other heads of state.
Director of Intelligence James Clapper justified spying on allies by saying it was necessary and common practice on both sides.
In the tumultuous atmosphere, Murphy said his office was planning a congressional trip, which was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and both houses.
The names of the other participating lawmakers are expected to be revealed in the coming days.
He said the route was yet to be determined.
Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to help improve relationships, but also to show &quot;loving firmness.&quot;
He explained that European heads of state need to be honest with their citizens about the kind of spy programs they themselves have been running for years.
“We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we&#39;re not the only people in the world spying,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry has planned to visit the Middle East and Poland this weekend to deal with resentment over US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as state surveillance activities. -United.
Scott Brown&#39;s appeal dismissed
Scott Brown, captain of Celtic Glasgow, has had his appeal rejected and will be well suspended for his club&#39;s next two Champions League matches, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expelled against Barça for hitting Neymar, the Scottish midfielder saw his suspension extended to three games by UEFA.
In a statement, his club said he was &quot;very disappointed&quot;, believing that his appeal was entirely justified.
For the CEO of Titan, &quot;the plan to buy Goodyear Amiens starts with zero employees&quot;
After throwing in the towel with a bang in January for the partial takeover of the Goodyear site in Amiens-Nord promised to be closed, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American tire manufacturer Titan, declares today that he is ready to save 333 jobs on the 1,137 in the factory.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister for Productive Recovery, had already announced it on Monday, October 21.
After having given up on the plan to buy the factory in January, you are back today.
You had uttered violent attacks and insults, speaking of &quot;so-called workers&quot;, who &quot;work three hours&quot; a day, of &quot;crazy&quot; unions, targeting the CGT.
We do not understand this reversal.
Is it to please M. Montebourg?
I&#39;m not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man who is trying to save some of the best paid industrial jobs.
If I hurt anyone with my words, I&#39;m sorry.
But France has a high level of taxes and unemployment too.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries we work eight hours handicaps France.
In India, China and many other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I have no prejudices about France.
What I see is a plant that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located, and has room to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so badly?
Titan doesn&#39;t need to buy this factory.
But, with a decent price and skilled workers, it&#39;s worth a try.
What type of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the plant, Goodyear had offered the employees a good severance package, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now imagine that Titan buys the closed factory from Goodyear.
From then on, Titan could move the machines to Poland or to any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
However, he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from among the approximately 1,200 current Goodyear employees.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before trying to get CGT to sit down at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is for the CGT and Goodyear to seal an agreement on severance packages for all employees.
From then on, there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said that you were prepared to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm it?
The only number I mentioned to the minister was 333.
I know he would want a four year warranty.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance pay.
If all the employees accept them, the plan to buy the factory starts with zero employees.
How can we give job tenure guarantees when there are no employees left on site?
If Mr. Montebourg manages to get the CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan to buy the factory, we fully intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to the local police, there would be at least 2 injured.
It would be an employee working for the United States Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the author of the shots.
The incident reportedly happened at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travelers and staff rushed to the exits or onto the tarmac.
Very quickly the police intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport car park.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
Supreme Court upholds Obama&#39;s health care reform bill
Big victory for the Obama administration: The US Supreme Court today ruled that the health care reform bill signed by Obama was constitutional.
By a vote of 5 to 4, the judges upheld the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014 or face having to pay a fine – and said it was constitutional under the government&#39;s power to tax.
Supreme Court President John Roberts joined the court&#39;s four most liberal members, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy disagreed.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page law and further considered that the provision of the health system reform law, which stipulates that the threshold for eligibility for Medicaid must be lowered under penalty of losing all federal program funding, was coercive under the constitution.
The lawsuit to block the law has been initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All of the major Republican presidential candidates running in the 2012 primaries, including nominee Mitt Romney, fiercely opposed the law.
Aretha Franklin will return to the stage in December
The Detroit News newspaper reports that the queen of soul will perform on December 21 at the Sound Board room of the MotorCity Casino hotel.
Ms. Franklin is busy recording an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music in November, produced by Don Was and Kenny &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease from which she suffered, the famous interpreter of Respect had told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were “difficult”.
She says she is &quot;happy to be back&quot;.
Children should be taught myths and legends as &quot;lifestyle models&quot;, says the author.
The Legend of Thor might show that &quot;brutal force is no match for subtle cunning&quot;, while the Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be &quot;far too violent, far too outrageous and in some cases, far too obscene to be taught in school&quot;, Crossley-Holland advocated a &quot;careful selection&quot; of age-appropriate works.
&quot;I think it&#39;s great that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,&quot; he said.
I have been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are &quot;overtly didactic&quot; causes children to &quot;completely drop out&quot;, with messages being &quot;sublimated&quot; into enjoyable stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: &quot;You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight. »
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end well, but there is an innate sense of right and wrong.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than stated.
The known basis of what is shown and not told.
US green light for Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday that they had received no objections from US authorities to their merger, thus approaching the creation of the world&#39;s largest advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
&quot;Omnicom Group and Publicis Groupe today announced the expiration of the review period for the previously announced merger of Publicis Groupe and Omnicom under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended&quot;, announce the two groups in a press release.
They specify that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiration of the review period provided by the HSR in the United States and the authorization decisions issued in other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the completion of the transaction.
&quot;The merger is also subject to obtaining other regulatory clearances and shareholder approval of both groups,&quot; they add.
New class action lawsuit against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new class action lawsuit has been filed against the Sainte-Croix brothers, concerning sexual assaults that allegedly took place this time at Saint Joseph&#39;s Oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the testimony of the applicant, identified as &quot;J. J&quot;, who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher, brother Soumis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at Saint Joseph&#39;s Oratory, where he was a mass server and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal only targeted three establishments, and when we announced the settlement, many people said to us: “I was at such a place, can I register?”, says the lawyer. Alain Arsenault, who is defending the victims in the two actions.
The class action that has just been filed has the particularity of allowing the addition of plaintiffs from any establishment where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the Congrégation de Sainte-Croix.
At present, the action brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been attacked by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The facts alleged are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the establishments in question closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal further emphasizes that the Congrégation de Sainte-Croix and the Oratoire Saint-Joseph, which is a separate entity, &quot;allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children&quot;, that they &quot;exercised moral, religious and psychological coercion on the victims&quot;, that they &quot;knew of the sexual abuse perpetrated and nevertheless covered it up&quot;, and that they &quot;knowingly and consciously chose to ignore the problem&quot;.
These latest accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer for the Sainte-Croix brothers, Me Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on research carried out in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuse.
The class action must first pass the admissibility stage in the Superior Court.
Once admissibility has been accepted by the Court, we proceed to the second stage, namely the hearings on the merits.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were conducted on the merits.
DRC: the army prepares a new assault
Children play on a charred armored vehicle that belonged to M23 rebels, in Kibumba on October 31, 2013, eastern DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing for a new assault on Friday against the last strongholds of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The objective is to dislodge the M23 from the hills above Bunagana.
Yesterday we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall on her own.
Only Runyonyi hill will remain.
&quot;That of Chanzu is not very strategic,&quot; North Kivu governor Julien Paluku told AFP.
Mr. Paluku plans to travel to Bunagana on Saturday.
Political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion, this locality is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was taken over on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred diehards of the M23 have been entrenched at an altitude of nearly 2,000 meters on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the neighboring town of Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who had reported nearby fighting all day Thursday said the situation had been &quot;calm since this morning&quot;.
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fighting the day before and were buried.
A girl was shot and injured, and three other people were injured, including one seriously, evacuated by the FARDC, added this witness quoted by AFP.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on October 25, the two belligerents have given no assessment of the loss of human life.
Court blocks ruling on NYPD stop and search policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge&#39;s decision demanding changes to the New York Police Department&#39;s stop and search program and removed her from the case.
The United States Court of Appeals (Second Circuit) said Judge Shira Scheindlin&#39;s decision was stayed pending the outcome of the city&#39;s appeal.
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program to control and interrogate citizens.
The city appealed its findings and remedial orders, including a decision to assign a monitor to help the police department change its policy and associated training program.
The appeals court heard arguments on the stay request on Tuesday.
The appeals court said the judge should be removed from the case because she breached the code of conduct for judges by compromising a judge&#39;s need to avoid any appearance of bias, in part due to a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly reacted to the court&#39;s criticisms.
The judge had ruled that police officers were violating the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their stop and search program.
She appointed an outside monitor to oversee changes, including reforming policies, training and supervision, and she ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in neighborhoods where the greatest number of checks take place.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police check.
The hearing of the city&#39;s appeal is scheduled to take place after March 14, 2014.
The stop and search tactic has been criticized by many civil rights advocates.
This stop and search system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of stops recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an all-time high in 2011 at 684,330 stops. which primarily involved black and Hispanic men.
A legal action was brought in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into a class action.
Supporters advocating changes to the NYPD&#39;s stop and frisk program say they will end unfair practices, lead to more effective and trusted police forces, and can change the way law enforcement departments police use politics.
Opponents say the changes would undermine police morale without lowering crime, would be a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after police numbers were sharply reduced over the past of the last decade.
The judge emphasized that she was not ending stop and search practices, which are constitutional, but reforming the way the NYPD implements its checks.
NSA revelations heighten corporate paranoia over state surveillance
On a fine day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany&#39;s financial capital.
On the orders of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany&#39;s national intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media explain that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of US intelligence, insisted again in September that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to &quot;steal trade secrets from foreign companies on behalf of corporate Americans in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits&quot;.
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant-turned-whistleblower, began uncovering his endless treasure trove of information on US surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate executives are at a loss whether to believe the manager on his word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by U.S. cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have sparked paranoia more than ever. companies with regard to state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s phone had been hacked, possibly for a decade, was the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back.
If Europe&#39;s most powerful person can be targeted, then surely corporate executives are also potential targets.
Snowden made the intensive collaboration between US intelligence and business seamless.
I find it conceivable that this data is used for their mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” says Oliver Grün, chairman of BITMi, which represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe the United States is as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a July survey by consultancy EY.
However, in all the documents revealed by Mr. Snowden, there is nothing to date to indicate that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and internet capabilities and believe it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A member of the German parliament says that we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly...
“That&#39;s not the right way to do it,” says Hasso Plattner, president of German enterprise software company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we shouldn&#39;t let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars to farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
Still, the scale and sophistication of US spy agencies exposed by Snowden&#39;s revelations came as a shock to some companies that had until then thought China posed the biggest surveillance risk.
A big change is happening in cloud computing as European officials realize that data stored in the United States is governed under the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, some 10% of non-US members backed away from plans to use a US cloud storage service provider after revelations about the US data mining program. Prism data.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, says, &quot;Our customers are asking us a question today that they weren&#39;t asking us a year ago: where is my data stored and can you assure me that it&#39;s physically remain in that jurisdiction? &quot;.
Many German leaders say the latest reports are just a confirmation of what they already know, which is that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There always have been.
&quot;This has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion,&quot; says Kurt Bock, managing director of chemicals company BASF.
Americans spy on us commercially and industrially just as we spy on them because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to reveal the preventive measures they have in place, in case it gives the advantage to an adversary.
Big corporations have long hammered home the message that it&#39;s unwise to pick up a free USB drive at a trade show or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of car manufacturer Audi, says collecting cell phones before board meetings, so they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been common practice for decades. years.
Germany&#39;s BfV advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when traveling abroad due to the risk of compromising the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid cell phones are then discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized businesses remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
“SMEs often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect their trade secrets against unauthorized access,” warns the BfV in a report.
The United States alerts its own companies to economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States, cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty in the second degree of having carried out acts of piracy of economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst”.
Bernard Squarcini, former director of France&#39;s internal intelligence, DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies. »
A tax on foreign property owners to burst the London bubble
The Treasury has tentatively priced the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne who in the 2012 budget listed a 7% stamp duty on properties costing more than £2m £ and annual fee for buyers who choose to hold properties as part of a company rather than as an individual.
Stamp duty already applies to residential properties in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington &amp; Chelsea, and amounts to £708m in the 2012/13 tax year, exceeding the total amount for Northern Ireland, the country of Wales, Scotland, North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: &quot;Following the increase in stamp duty on high value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law in this area, it is very difficult to argue that high value properties are undertaxed regardless of the effects of the outdated council tax system. »
“But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell,” he added.
Prime property – the top 5-10% of house market prices – in the thriving south-west London area that stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen by a record percentage 11.8% over the past year.
Prices in central London are showing steady year-on-year growth of 5.6% but have been overshadowed by a growing &#39;inner market&#39;, the city&#39;s South West, North (7.4% ) and the east (6.5%) experiencing a recovery, according to the Savills studies.
The shutdown in the USA has slowed the rise in the automotive market
The 16-day shutdown of most federal governments weighed on U.S. car sales growth in October, automakers&#39; figures showed on Friday, with five of the top six performing below expectations.
Detroit&#39;s three major manufacturers posted double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts were anticipating an average of 15.4 million annualized and seasonally adjusted sales, but the market settled at 15.3 million according to estimates by Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas.
In a note to the bank&#39;s clients, he believes that this slight slowdown is primarily due to &quot;the government shutdown and its impact on consumer sentiment during the first half of the month&quot;.
GM nevertheless reported an increase of almost 16% in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, against 211,563 expected by the consensus.
The group&#39;s four brands saw their commercial performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit from the success of its pick-ups, among other things, saw its sales increase by 14% over one year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus was expecting 194,301.
For its part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an 11% increase in sales to 140,083 vehicles, against 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also posted sales below consensus, despite year-on-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
On the New York Stock Exchange, GM shares gained 1.4% at 4:35 p.m. GMT while Ford lost 1.1%.

A study to multiply the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland has been launched by the UK government.
Work by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and the North of England will start as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would &quot;bring the UK together&quot;.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was &quot;excited&quot; to work with the UK government on the project.
Phase 1 will be a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the north of England upwards from £32.7bn to £42.6bn.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to look into increasing rail capacity and improving journey times for the north of England and Scotland.
This must include the possibility of journey times between Glasgow and Edinburgh of no more than three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our focus for HS2 is on a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together. »
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits it presents are enormous.
Without it, we face a capacity problem in our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that links between them are better thanks to HS2.
UK Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael added: “Today&#39;s announcement is good news for Scotland. »
For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to &quot;unequivocally&quot; support Scotland&#39;s inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: &quot;High-speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland&#39;s economic clout to the overall high-speed rail project across Great Britain.
“We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the UK government to explore options to bring the high-speed rail network to Scotland, creating a benefit for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line. which the Scottish Government is already planning.
“I look forward to reading the review report with UK ministers next year and we will then decide together on the next steps. »
The UN welcomes the new objectives in favor of the fight against poverty
The United Nations will immediately start working on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were set up 12 years ago to fight poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing forward &#39;sustainable development goals&#39; to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, ahead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit which started the day before in Rio de Janeiro .
They were in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that now was the time to &quot;go beyond national interests&quot;.
“I am pleased that Member States have agreed to initiate and own the process to set universal Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),” he added.
These SDGs will build on progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfill the mandate given to me by Member States to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Parents of intersex children can choose &quot;undetermined sex&quot;
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sex organs.
The male or female sex of newborns will no longer be assigned to them, in a rigid manner, at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare their child&#39;s sex, allowing them to enter an &quot;undetermined&quot; or &quot;unspecified&quot; sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to take the pressure off the shoulders of parents who might make hasty decisions about sex reassignment surgery for their infants, and to fight discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person reportedly said years later, “I am neither male nor female. »
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors created, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, with intersex being part of the group of about 60 diseases diagnosed as disorders of sex development, an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sex organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Gender identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when gender cannot be determined, it is best to use the best information available to assign it, then wait and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before considering surgery, if necessary.
Dr Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and a specialist in gender identification issues, said the new German law &quot;seems like a good idea&quot;.
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have extremely serious illnesses that require surgery, but most children don&#39;t,” he added.
It is possible to make a sex assignment without surgery, and see how the identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a gender identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It&#39;s like the mystery that surrounds homosexual people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, since their status is not linked to sex but rather to their biological makeup, which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively that of a woman, but is usually both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other.
These characteristics may manifest themselves in secondary sex characteristics (such as muscle mass, body hair, chest, and stature), primary sex characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sex organs), or body structure. chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination intersex and transgender people face in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and bias-motivated crimes.
Gender-nonconforming young boys now have camps just for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to write male, female or “third sex” on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be declared &#39;neutral&#39; after winning her appeal case which allows her to keep an &#39;unspecified&#39; gender for life.
German passports will feature a third designation alongside M or F–X for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers in this staunchly Catholic country signed a petition to have “gender theory” removed from school books.
US site Catholic Online also opposed the German law, writing that &quot;as the world is dragged into a new realm where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not, two more pillars of civilization. »
In Maryland, the mother-of-one also told Baby Zone that she would prefer babies were assigned a sex when they were born.
&quot;Parenting is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don&#39;t know your child&#39;s gender,&quot; she told the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sex organs were called hermaphrodites, after the name of the magnificent Greek god who had dual sex.
And just a decade ago, the medical community treated gender as a slate that you can erase and redraw on.
But now many are questioning the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex and sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about being gender reassigned when they grow up.
&quot;In the mid-twentieth century, it was called a psychiatric emergency,&quot; Drescher said.
When these children were born, we did not call the psychiatrist, we telephoned the surgeon.
The prevailing theory on how to deal with children with ambiguous sex organs was started by Dr. John Money of Johns-Hopkins University, who considered gender to be malleable.
He coined the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that social and environmental cues - the way parents raise a child - interact with a child&#39;s genes and hormones to shape them to be identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as “John/Joan,” his theories caused controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been severed in a botched circumcision to castrate him entirely, removing his testicles as well, and raise him as a girl.
&quot;Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it wasn&#39;t,&quot; Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors are &quot;always repeating that pattern.&quot;
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who had survived these sex reassignment operations said that “they were not satisfied with the result”.
Such is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sex organs.
Doctors couldn&#39;t really tell if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never have a &quot;satisfying life&quot; as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce had his external organ and testicles surgically removed and was raised as a girl.
She was put on female hormones when she was 12 years old.
&quot;I knew I wasn&#39;t a girl,&quot; he told ABCNews.com.
I wasn&#39;t happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At 18, he underwent vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing something was wrong, he asked for his medical records.
What he discovered horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with Disorder of Sex Development (DDS) which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sex organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, undergoing testosterone treatment and had his breasts removed.
The surgery made him sterile.
Today, he champions the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, chief executive of the California-based nonprofit Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that the German law &quot;invites labeling and stigmatization&quot;.
&quot;Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an &#39;undetermined&#39; sex,&quot; she said.
We are afraid that it encourages interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female gender, and wait.
But we didn&#39;t see what the law was going to give, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports the Australian law because &quot;it allows adults to choose to be recognized as the third gender&quot;.
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender,” she added.
German law concerns the assignment of sex at birth.
This is not a battle that young children should fight at this age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammograms in Pittsburgh, whose daughter has a disorder of sexual development and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said the German law will “empower” parents and children.
Dr. Baratz&#39;s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of her androgen receptors, Katie developed feminine characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29, Katie is married and a child psychiatrist resident at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogate mothers.
&quot;The law gives parents some leeway so they don&#39;t have to make hasty decisions,&quot; Baratz said.
This gives them time to take certain tests and understand them, and a delay before registering “masculine” or “feminine”.
So it&#39;s all right – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and are enjoying parenting.
You don&#39;t have to rush for surgery which is irreversible.
&quot;It puts the kids at the heart of the decision and alleviates the feeling of anxiety that drives parents because they&#39;re afraid they&#39;re not doing the right thing,&quot; she said.
Finally, the child will decide which gender he/she feels most comfortable with – and that&#39;s a great thing.
This empowers the child to make the decision for themselves.
An octogenarian greets children with a rifle at Le Muy for Halloween
The minors, aged 9 and 13, went door to door asking for candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the Muy district visited by the children opened the door holding his shotgun.
The old man, aged 86, explained to the gendarmes that he had been afraid.
His weapon was seized.
The cry of despair of an Obama voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of change
He says Obama made laudable efforts thwarted by Republican Party filibuster
Obstructionism is no excuse for the Obamacare site&#39;s difficulties, or drone attacks
Obama&#39;s 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I&#39;m reading an awfully sad book these days.
This is a book that I thought would cheer me up through the gloom of 2nd year med and give me hope.
It&#39;s called &quot;The Audacity to Win&quot; and it&#39;s the memoir of Barack Obama&#39;s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patients&#39; medical reports at night and go to bed, this book takes me back to the days when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended in a landslide victory and news anchors took time to reflect on the historic nature of the moment.
My classmates cried with joy and my parents kept all the diaries they found.
A young team of visionaries was advancing towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama&#39;s transition period before taking office in 2008, he had 82% favorable opinions.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it&#39;s like coming out of a dream.
It is hard to remember those days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years since I first voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great accomplishments, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of our army from Iraq, to the end of the &quot;neither seen nor known&quot; and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Further, I believe partisan filibuster has destroyed too many efforts to move our nation forward on immigration reforms, public health care, and closing Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending the Obama administration to my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I am on the verge of political despair.
Republican stonewalling cannot explain the bugging of foreign leaders, nor the drone attacks on innocent foreign children.
She cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans, nor the indictment of whistleblowers who reveal government misdeeds.
It cannot justify the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the evasion of public funds and the overspending during presidential campaigns.
She can&#39;t substantiate the conclusions of a report that says the White House&#39;s efforts to silence the media are the &quot;most aggressive...since the Nixon administration.&quot;
And, more recently, she can&#39;t excuse the inability to design a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.
I don&#39;t know if this is what I expected.
If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that precede it.
Obviously, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and the events that happen by chance, like the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all of the examples I&#39;ve listed above seem to be largely the administration&#39;s choice.
That&#39;s what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that did not seem to help determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected to a second term freed from the pressure of future elections, would deliver on the promises we had heard about for so long.
Yet, as the Positive Opinion Index dipped below 45% this week, it&#39;s even harder to look back to 2008 through this book.
He makes me long for the many promises that have flown away.
This week I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses to Clinton in the Pennsylvania Primaries.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team they needed to get back on track and stay true to their cause.
&quot;I want us to refocus on our talent,&quot; he said.
We must remember who we are.
Here we are 5 years later, Mr. President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
La Nouvelle Star made a strong comeback in terms of audiences, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV set, or 5.6% of the audience share.
But was the show on point?
Some 10,000 candidates showed up for the auditions for this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the villainous Sinclair, the perched André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really scored during this first bonus.
Like every year, the first audition shows bring together a wide choice of budding singers, for better and sometimes for worse.
However, on Twitter, we want spectacle, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, some have found their account.
Many of them have tried the New Star, and sometimes even gone all the way.
Behind the television screens, the vocations of a successful singer are always there, season after season.
Others just want to make people laugh.
RBS suspends two forex traders
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its FX division according to two sources familiar with the matter, further showing that regulators&#39; global investigation into suspected FX market manipulation is starting to bear fruit.
Some of the world&#39;s biggest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed they are cooperating with regulators in investigations into the world&#39;s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion US change hands every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the widening investigation which echoes the Libor interbank rate manipulation scandal.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
&quot;The ongoing investigation into this matter is continuing and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators,&quot; a bank representative said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources familiar with the matter said RBS had passed records of emails and instant messages, sent to and by a former trader, to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as European head of spot trading for currencies at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European head of spot foreign exchange trading at Citi, was furloughed this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged.
Mr Usher&#39;s dossier included instant messages sent to and from bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, people familiar with the matter added.
UBS explained this week that it had taken legal action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating suspected foreign exchange market manipulation at a number of banks. Swiss.
Around the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the United States Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are looking into allegations made about bankers who colluded to manipulate rates on the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, people familiar with the matter said.
Banks have been sifting through instant messages and emails sent for years to find instances of wrongdoing.
News of the investigations has rattled traders in an industry that has been one of the biggest growth drivers for investment banking trading units in recent years, but has been challenged this year due to low currency volatility which limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play it down by saying it&#39;s nearly impossible to manipulate the vast, highly liquid forex market, but senior traders say that&#39;s not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily FX trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between exchange management platforms and the increasing use by banks of their own platforms internal &quot;explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at little cost&quot;.
The news came the same day Credit Suisse announced it had fired a trader working in its London Stock Exchange-traded funds office this week after he caused a $6 million loss late last year.
The bank promptly notified the relevant authorities and cooperated with regulators.
“We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the matter was brought under control,” said a representative of Credit Suisse.
Chinese newspaper that appealed &#39;will be overhauled&#39;
A Chinese newspaper that made a front-page appeal for the release of a journalist accused of defamation is to be overhauled, a press regulator says.
The Guangzhou-based New Express issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he took bribes to fabricate stories about a parastatal company.
Now the New Express will undergo a &quot;complete overhaul&quot;, the regulator said.
The &quot;reshuffle&quot; order comes from the Guangdon Administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, part of the Yangcheng Evening News group, published several erroneous articles about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
&quot;New Express&#39;s editorial staff was disorganized,&quot; the regulator said in a statement.
He indicated that he had decided &quot;to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card&quot;.
He also &quot;ordered the Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a comprehensive overhaul of New Express, and recommended that it investigate those responsible at New Express and immediately overhaul the newspaper&#39;s management team.&quot;
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express about alleged financial irregularities at a construction machinery maker called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a front-page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen later appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to posting false stories for money.
&quot;In this matter, I have harmed Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public trust,&quot; he told public broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was chasing money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen&#39;s apology, New Express published his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several prominent suspects have recently made televised confessions.
Experts say people are routinely coerced into confessing, despite a change in the law passed earlier this year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
Obama backtracks on health care reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama yesterday reneged on his unambiguous and oft-repeated promise that &quot;if you&#39;re happy with your health care plan, you can keep it.&quot;
After hundreds of thousands of people received termination notices from their providers, Republicans have slammed the president in recent days, accusing him of misleading the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
&quot;The vast majority of people who have health insurance that suits them can keep it,&quot; he said during a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls &quot;a buzz in the news&quot; about cancellations, President Obama urged Americans who received these notices to seek new insurance in the marketplace.
Most people will be able to get comprehensive, more tailored health plans for the same price, or even less than expected.
“You will come out a winner,” he said.
The Administration announced that it should come as no surprise if the 5% of the population who buy their own insurance find themselves forced to switch plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me speak directly to these Americans: you deserve better,” Kathleen Sebelius said during her testimony before the Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Ms Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the October launch of the online marketplace had failed &quot;miserably&quot;.
&quot;I&#39;m as frustrated and irritated as anyone,&quot; she added.
I look forward to regaining your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this sentence, when she thought her microphone was cut off, when speaking to an assistant seated behind her during yesterday&#39;s Assembly session following an exchange of points of contentious view with Republican Rep. Billy Long from Missouri over whether she should join Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long kept insisting Ms Sebelius why the &#39;architect&#39; of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance to take out a scheme through HealthCare.gov, which she now touts to millions of Americans.
The Coen Brothers Tribute to Folk
&quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot; by the Coen brothers, Grand Prize at the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich village of 1961 and the folk music that was just beginning to resonate there, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the Cinémathèque française, won the Palme d&#39;Or at Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Failing to be able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have set their sights on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the planetary pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and the songs performed live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself as an accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music. with contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she has left the rich trappings of Daisy Mulligan in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; for less shiny clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the machine-gun swearword when she speaks.
&quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot; recounts the tribulations of a folk singer over a week who cannot break through and becomes angry with the whole world.
He reluctantly accepts replacements at short notice in the studios.
Homeless, he makes the rounds of the sofas of his friends who are still willing to receive him.
An air of documentary
&quot;His relationship with success is tortured, that&#39;s what we were interested in: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not careerist but honest, with a self-destructive behavior&quot;, declared to the press Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel with several Oscars and prizes at Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two folk music fan filmmakers built their history on real personalities of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this district of New York destined to become &quot;the epicenter of the rise of folk music which would spawn international stars&quot; as the journalist Elijah Wald wrote. , friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes on the appearance of a documentary, from the dusty music label invaded by unsold LPs inhabited by an old priceless secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where the singers performed.
The magic of the Coen brothers still works by integrating a funny character who crosses the film permanently: a magnificent ginger cat with a cute look, companion of fortune of Llewyn Davis.
Asked how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled having &quot;grown up in Tennessee, bathed in blues and country&quot;.
&quot;My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play the guitar,&quot; he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary to &quot;be considered good&quot;, &quot;chance can also launch someone&#39;s career&quot;, and &quot;more and more today&quot;.
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses to compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, &quot;the most important thing is not to get stuck in anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves&quot;.
Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, on Friday reported a drop in quarterly profit due to lower refining margins, as its oil and gas production increased but lagged behind targets. of the group.
Its third-quarter net profit fell to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts polled by Reuters on average had expected earnings per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd produced a year earlier.
The company is targeting 2.65 million bpd for this year, with 25% production growth expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual capital expenditure has increased by $7 billion in two years and is expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities fell slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell 45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Thus the main competitor of Chevron, Exxon Mobil reported Thursday a net profit down, despite the increase in its production of gas and oil.
The LA Times reports that an agent from the United States Transportation Security Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of gunfire.
Firefighters called to the scene of the tragedy said they responded to a call reporting &quot;multiple injuries&quot;.
&quot;The police are on site,&quot; said the airport on its Twitter account, while television images showed evacuees in ambulances.
&quot;There was a shootout,&quot; a spokesman for the US Transportation Security Agency (TSA) told AFP.
The local ABC antenna showed an evacuee on a stretcher, and a second transported on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9:30 a.m. local time (12:30 p.m. in Montreal) at the airport&#39;s Terminal 3, the airport also said.
The Los Angeles Times specifies that terminals 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesperson was unable to immediately confirm whether any of its employees were injured.
All flights arriving and departing from the airport have been suspended.
NSA espionage: US has &#39;gone too far&#39;, admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone &quot;too far&quot; in terms of espionage, acknowledged Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first admission by Washington in the midst of a controversy with Europe over the massive collection of data by the Agency National Security (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time that a US government official has explicitly admitted to controversial practices in the NSA&#39;s interception of communications and data. in Europe.
&quot;In some cases, I&#39;ll grant you, like the president has, some of those actions have gone too far and we&#39;re going to make sure that doesn&#39;t happen again in the future,&quot; John Kerry said during an interview. a conference in London in which he participated from Washington Thursday, October 31 by video link.
In his broadcast speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of the American diplomacy justified at length the practices of intelligence and the collection of information by the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of September 11, 2001, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and those in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the American authorities had since thwarted numerous plans for attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and the information gathering.
&quot;We have in fact prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered, because we were able to be aware of these projects in advance&quot;, argued the head of diplomacy. American.
And, John Kerry told the Europeans, &quot;I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived&quot;.
But we are trying to gather information.
&quot;And yes, in some cases, it went too far inappropriately,&quot; admitted the Secretary of State, who had already had to speak about this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday evening that President Obama was &quot;committed to trying to clarify and that he was reviewing these practices so that no one feels cheated&quot;.
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA was intercepting data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which cites documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, claims that the program dubbed &quot;MUSCULAR&quot;, and carried out with the NSA&#39;s British counterpart, GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from the optical fibers used by the Internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected in the month of January alone - ranging from metadata on e-mails, to text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection to these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy have revealed that the NSA would have massively intercepted data and communications from allies of the United States and their leaders, in particular German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the American press claimed that the American president was not aware of such tapping, Barack Obama refused to speak on this subject, citing national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had picked up tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even returned the ball to the European intelligence services which would have seized these communications, before providing them to the NSA.
This would concern &quot;military operations&quot; in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and it would absolutely not target Europe, said General Alexander.
And the controversy extended to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international spy ring which has also drawn the ire of China.
Precocious Puberty: Aging Earlier
Studies show that African American and Hispanic girls tend to hit puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical Changes Don&#39;t Mean Puberty Is Imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts think the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for precocious puberty
The tendency towards precocious puberty is not as pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter&#39;s breasts and pubic hair start growing at age 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, child endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young American women and represent a new standard.
&quot;I spend a lot of time reassuring parents — usually that doesn&#39;t indicate a rapid move into full puberty,&quot; Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as budding breasts, hair under the arms and in the pubic area, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age at first menstrual period over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, while it was 12 three quarters in 1970.
&quot;Once the breasts have started to grow, it takes at least two or three years before menstruation begins,&quot; said Kaplowitz, also the author of &quot;Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This. Common Problem”.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will evolve.
There is some debate regarding what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered &quot;early&quot; when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before age 8.
In most cases, development slows or stops – something a pediatrician can monitor closely.
Faster progression may warrant testing by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems like tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of the first period and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones which can slow down growth and short stature in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug and hormone treatment are based on the child&#39;s age, rate of development, rate of growth, and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with medication but acknowledges that &quot;controlling puberty can alleviate some behavioral problems and young girls&#39; sense of being different from others.&quot;
The other big problem is understandable: Parents just don&#39;t want their very young daughters to menstruate.
“They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they&#39;re going to handle hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter had her first period at age 10.
Even though there were signs and we talked about periods, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends.
There are many theories made known to the public about the causes of precocious puberty.
Yet there is no consistent theory that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz says the most credible hypothesis is the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study conducted on girls aged 6 to 9 that linked body fat percentage to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, the mechanics of precocious puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have younger facial and pubic hair, the trend toward true precocious puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other physicians attending the AAP conference emphasized the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
&quot;We have to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist working at Goryeb Children&#39;s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk with their child.
“It may mean having a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will generally react well.
Girls going through early puberty need to be reassured that, even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
Driver speeding 210mph with a hot drink between his legs has been fined £1,000
A motorist has been fined £1,000 for driving at 130mph with a hot drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree in Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the takeout drink between his legs.
At Colchester Magistrates&#39; Court, Howie admitted the offense of driving without due care and attention.
The seven points taken off his license led to a 6 month license withdrawal.
Howie was also ordered to pay costs amounting to £90 and a victim surcharge of £100.
A former hostage in Lebanon: &quot;The return is quite complex to manage&quot;
Kidnapped in Beirut on March 8, 1986 with three members of his &quot;Antenne 2&quot; team who came to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released nearly 21 months later, on November 27, 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the association for the defense of hostages &quot;Hostages of the world&quot;, which he has chaired for several years.
Its main objective: to obtain the possibility for the hostages to lodge a complaint and to bring their hostage takers before the International Criminal Court.
Detained for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of AQIM (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
And try, little by little, to resume the course of their lives.
&quot;Le Nouvel Observateur&quot; questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, ex-reporter, retired since 2008, president of the &quot;Hostages du monde&quot; association.
From the evening of your release, you were on the 8 p.m. set of &quot;Antenne 2&quot;.
What are your memories of your release today?
On the spot in particular, in Beirut.
When I am released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing him because it is dark - Roger Auque.
He tells me &quot;we&#39;re freed&quot;, but I&#39;m not sure, and tells me that we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but very tense too.
It&#39;s war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They drop us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the site of the Summerland hotel where the press is present.
French people take us to the French Embassy.
It&#39;s time for the first phone calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dined in a T-shirt at the French Embassy.
I also remember a short night chatting with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we don&#39;t have the means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arrived there by helicopter, we take a private plane which brings us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How was your arrival on French soil?
We land at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is there.
It&#39;s a bit brutal.
There is an incredible jostling.
And lots of media.
When I left there were three TV channels.
I come back and there are plenty.
The descent of the stairs from the plane, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, all of this is extremely emotional.
Between the airport and my house, many motorbikes follow our car, which Roussin drives.
The bikers pull the plug to take pictures and follow me to my house where I have to do a bit of policing to prevent some from riding.
The media pressure is enormous.
It does not stop, we are well placed to know it...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We come out of a hole and we are suddenly under the media spotlight.
It&#39;s a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to manage.
But we did the hard part.
The same evening, I am at 8 p.m., the next day also I am on TV.
Then begins a kind of readjustment to life, very gently, for one or two months which are a bit like a vacation.
How did the medical examinations and the DGSE debriefing go?
I had been entitled to a first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done at Val-de-Grâce the days following my return: X-rays, examinations of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It&#39;s not a session that does everything, but we know that we can count on him, call him back if necessary, that we are not on our own.
It&#39;s part of the procedure.
I also met the intelligence services.
They asked me about the hostage takers.
It made sense.
It didn&#39;t bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages from Niger?
I listen to what is being said.
The debate on ransoms in particular.
Some things annoy me, others less so.
I try to make a distinction between questions about my past as a hostage and my role as president of the &quot;Hostages of the World&quot; association, which allows me to put some distance, and seems much more interesting to me to land.
For example, I wonder about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I fight, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there is a problem of semantics.
We must qualify the taking of hostages as &quot;political&quot; hostage taking - which is the case most of the time - and allow the hostages to have access to justice, to file a complaint and to bring their takers hostages before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices in the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages could perhaps also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is made for that.
Why don&#39;t we say to the hostage takers &quot;you flouted the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva conventions, we will bring you to justice&quot;?
It seems to me, however, well-founded, legitimate, struck by common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened to, and that shocks me.
This is my main fight.
Sixth edition of Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of Play Skateboard takes place this Saturday, November 2 at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump association, the competition should bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations are taken on site Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualifying phases will begin immediately after, at 10 a.m., before the final scheduled for 3 p.m. and the prize-giving at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend competitions at the highest level, like the young prodigy from Hyères Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years old, he has already conquered his place for the European championships in Copenhagen this year and he likes nothing more than to show off to competitors who exceed him by three heads.
The Wolf of Wall Street: second trailer released
Martin Scorsese lets out a few images of his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget being reasonable and take out your tickets.
Leonardo DiCaprio will blow your hair in his role as a crazy trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a &quot;Long Island stockbroker who refuses to cooperate with the authorities in a massive corruption case on Wall Street&quot;.
In the 80s, Jordan Belfort set up a scam that made him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible rise, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
Without limits, the man connects parties, women, drugs.
Decadence and excess of all kinds are the hallmarks of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seem to have rediscovered the magic that united them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its lengthy editing.
It would seem that the film finally lasts 2h45.
In theaters on December 25, he will be able to participate in the race for the Oscars.
The London Stock Exchange closed lower on Thursday, weighed down by poor results from Shell and the day after an announcement by the Fed to maintain its support for the economy, as planned.
In La Seyne, rehousing due to rats turns into controversy
At the beginning of the week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
Faced with the urgency of the situation, the director of the Terres du Sud Habitat office offered, on an exceptional and temporary basis, to rehouse the couple and their three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses &quot;for financial reasons&quot; and the situation is blocked.
The affair has taken on exaggerated proportions, estimates Joël Canapa, the director of the office.
There have always been rats in cities.
The rat extermination company carries out two visits a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at each request from the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, we have carried out 64 interventions.
The district is not abandoned, and the rats do not swarm in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, rodent control products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, you&#39;re not going to kill a kid.
&quot;We did not invite the rats to our house&quot;, defends the father of the family who left his accommodation to settle in the hotel.
We are soon penniless and we are waiting for a new accommodation, at the same price as the old one.
Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal structure of defeasance (&quot;bad bank&quot;) grouping together 38 billion pounds (45 billion euros) of the most risky assets, a measure intended to relax its relations with London and to accelerate its reprivatization.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of doubtful assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned it up within three years.
RBS also said it would book an additional four to £4.5 billion bad debt write-down in the quarter, an entry related to the formation of the ring-fencing structure.
RBS also specified that this internal restructuring would free up 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, thus strengthening its ability to lend.
The bank and London have stressed that the &quot;bad bank&quot; would make it possible to draw a line under the past, the government having in particular been accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
&quot;We can now move forward, worry about the future and the 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a great bank for customers and for the UK,&quot; said new chief executive Ross. McEwan to the press.
George Kerevan: The break-up of Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time around we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European Free Movement Area in order to join the EU.
And now we hear stories of passport control at Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian&#39;s Wall.
While the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to the potential economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, it was not in the headlines (and that was to be expected).
Nor has anyone said that EU member states spend a lot of their time bending their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, continued non-compliance with the rules would be a slim concession that Brussels could offer in return for whatever it wants from the Scots.
It is therefore a story that is not one.
And a story so old it&#39;s now frozen: I first heard the canard that &quot;independence means passport control&quot; over 40 years ago.
Yet an interesting point has been overlooked in this interpretation of a dusty old tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe&#39;s instructions, anyway?
Why exchange the yoke of London for that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe has definitely come to a standstill.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties that oppose the EU or campaign for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded only this year and coming out of nowhere, garnered nearly five million votes in the September federal election and ousted the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats ) of the Bundestag.
There has always been national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, combined with the straitjacket weighing on national economies through joining the single currency, has led many to believe that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits – that was only true for Greece.
Rather, the European system has burdened its members with exchange rates favorable to German exporters – something German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe find themselves with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany.
The only recourse is to make drastic cuts in salaries and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise related to productivity in Europe.
As a result of “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize French and German energy companies at consumer expense – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas than the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the wage freezes in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, revolt is brewing, particularly in France, one of the great leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the battered French economy to scramble.
Result: Marine Le Pen&#39;s far-right party, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial by-election, sending the ruling Socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – a timely warning to Britain&#39;s Labor Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right will automatically favor the left.
What is Marine Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity with the French white working class?
She wants to use next year&#39;s European elections to create a single, anti-European anti-currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-single currency sentiment in Europe will unify and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will revert to something more like the free “Europe of (sovereign) Nations” favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will regain their own currency.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project, and hope that it will turn a blind eye to the US.
However, Washington&#39;s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
And Scotland, in all this?
We can decide to be a region of Little England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes screwing up Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could live with a freer European agreement provided that we keep our own motto.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
Scotland&#39;s SNP government is – and it should be noted – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, winning a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed (and implemented) deep cuts. implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labor Exchequer, Alistair Darling, and the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition that followed.
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
A house engulfed in flames in Old Quebec
A fire that broke out Friday noon in Old Quebec was quickly brought under control.
More than thirty firefighters were dispatched to 9 rue Hébert.
The flames broke out in a three-unit house spread over four floors located behind the courtyard of the Séminaire de Québec.
All the tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was brought under control an hour after the arrival of firefighters, who were numerous to intervene.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw apparent smoke.
&quot;So the alarms followed one another, because it took reinforcements to attack the building, because it&#39;s buildings glued here&quot;, explained France Loiselle, spokesperson for the firefighters of Quebec.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of the fire.
Spectacular wingsuit jump over Bogota
Athlete Jhonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter over Bogota, the Colombian capital, on Thursday.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination equipped with wings), he passed at 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located more than 3,000 meters above sea level, where many onlookers had gathered to observe his achievement.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
Entering the 500 m2 of the Elysian kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies, the cook climbed all the levels to become a chef nine years ago.
He has served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande to Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation spots, and nurtured countless greats of this world in a virtual anonymity that he only breaks today. retiring today, at age 60.
The man with an open face, bald head and intellectual glasses, born on October 24, 1953 in La Ferté-Saint-Aubin, holds a pastry CAP.
His mother was herself a cook in a chateau in Sologne.
“I went from one castle to another!”, ironically Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manias of the six presidents for whom he officiated, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
&quot;It&#39;s always the head of state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus,&quot; he recalls.
&quot;Ms. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly to the kitchen&quot;, to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
No offense to heads of state who displayed relative indifference to earthly foods, &quot;they are all greedy&quot;, gently denounces Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had &quot;a slightly more developed appetite&quot;.
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates came back empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored the cheese, &quot;he is someone who likes to eat&quot; and &quot;there is not much he does not like&quot;.
The current head of state, who regained the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has &quot;no specific diet request&quot;.
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially during state dinners at the Elysée: you have to serve &quot;between 200 and 250 people in about an hour&quot;.
The night before is almost white.
These people would not understand that there are errors.
The now former chef of the Elysée kitchens, who had a drink on Tuesday evening with his team, his family and friends, leaves with a twinge in his heart. “François Hollande came to greet me”.
He said praise.
&quot;His human side came out,&quot; he says.
The leader will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been at the Elysée for seventeen years.
A collision between two vehicles left four injured early Friday on Route 131 in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 a.m., a motorist traveling northbound in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and hit a car coming from the other direction.
The four occupants of both vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
Traffic was back to normal around 6 a.m. Friday.
Mayor Rob Ford investigation botched, lawyer claims
After police confirmed they got hold of a copy of the video that allegedly showed Rob Ford smoking crack cocaine, Clayton Ruby said he had never seen such a sloppy investigation.
Ruby told The Canadian Press that police &quot;ignored or minimized&quot; the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford&#39;s friend and occasional driver, 35-year-old Alexander Lisi, and charged him with extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police said they also observed the man delivering packages to Rob Ford, new court documents show.
Mr Ruby called it &quot;inexplicable&quot; that the police never searched Rob Ford&#39;s vehicle or his home, or tapped his phone, arguing that Chief Constable Bill Blair knowingly chose to do not act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford&#39;s vehicle, arrested the mayor, and carried out a search - even without a warrant.
She could also have requested an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash described Mr Ruby&#39;s remarks as an &quot;obvious and desperate attempt&quot; to promote himself to the media in a matter that does not concern him in any way.
At a press conference on Thursday, Mr. Blair said there was nothing in the video that could constitute &quot;reasonable grounds&quot; that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
A fighter from Hamas&#39; military wing was killed and another wounded by Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip this evening, medical and security sources in Gaza said.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they came under shellfire from an Israeli armored vehicle.
German journalists urged to flee Google and Yahoo
The union of German journalists on Thursday invited its members to stop using the online services of Google and Yahoo the day after new revelations about the activities of the American and British intelligence services.
“The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo search engines and messaging until further notice,” it said in a statement.
She considers &quot;scandalous&quot; the information from the Washington Post, according to which the American National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected masses of information by infiltrating the international networks which allow the two firms to synchronize their servers.
&quot;Research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them,&quot; added Michael Konken, president of the union which claims 38,000 members.
A CGR room in Narbonne evacuated Thursday evening
Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR in Narbonne, as a precaution, following tingling in the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the establishment had the room evacuated and alerted the firefighters to a suspicious odor.
About 70 people walked out of the session.
The people were examined and a full recognition of the room did not give anything.
Bad joke against a backdrop of tear gas?
Or unintentional incident?
Still, the cinema management played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers thoroughly.
The room was aired out and everything was back to normal.
The cinema was able to regain its rights and customers rediscover the pleasure of images.
On screen only.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a faulty water heater at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which seriously injured two people on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a faulty water heater. , said the deputy public prosecutor on Friday evening.
The expert dispatched to the scene by the prosecution ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a build-up of gas.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is still engaged.
The grandmother was thrown by the explosion and was seriously burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his partner, was at his side and was slightly burned.
&quot;The two victims were intubated and conditioned for a long time on the spot before being taken to the CHU of Liège, she by helicopter, he by ambulance&quot;, specified the mayor José Paulet, descended on the scene.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and sound, he was able to reach the ground floor by the staircase which remained intact while the back wall of the house was totally destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the neighboring house, weakened by the explosion, were rehoused by the president of the CPAS.
The Andenne and Namur firefighters and the Arches police intervened.
Crisnée civil protection stabilized the two buildings.
A black box in your car?
As highway planners across the United States struggle to find the money to repair crumbling highway infrastructure, many see a solution in the form of a little black box that hovers above from your car&#39;s dashboard.
The devices, which log all the miles traveled by a motorist and relay the information to officials, are at the center of a controversial bid in Washington and government planning offices to overhaul the outdated system of funding America&#39;s major highways.
The generally irrelevant area of highway planning has suddenly sparked heated debate and turbulent alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups to lobby the government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly the road you travel, and then use the information to craft a tax bill.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concerns about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress can&#39;t agree on whether to continue, several states have not waited.
They are researching how, over the next decade, they can move to a system where drivers pay based on the number of miles driven.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental trip.
This is truly essential for our nation.
&quot;It&#39;s not like we have a choice,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, chief executive of the Southern California Association of Governments, which expects the state to begin logging the miles driven by every California motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do that.
The pressure comes as the country&#39;s Highway Trust Fund, funded with the taxes Americans pay at the pumps, is financially broke.
Americans don&#39;t buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars can go more miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to increase the tax even by 1 cent when gas prices are high.
&quot;The gas tax just isn&#39;t sustainable,&quot; said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently had trackers installed on 500 cars to test a pay-per-mile system.
“It turns out to be the most logical long-term alternative,” he said.
Wonks calls this a mileage user fee.
It&#39;s no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals, since the taxes could be used to change driving habits in ways that help reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve goals set out in the state&#39;s ambitious global warming laws.
But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free-market proponents of the Reason Foundation also like the idea of charging drivers by the mile.
“This isn&#39;t just a tax going down a big black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits provided to them.
The move is also backed by two former US transportation secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go the pay-per-mile route.
The US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have involved around 10,000 cars.
But the House Speaker killed the proposal, addressing the concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents who have to travel many miles every day to get to work or to town.
Several states and major cities are nonetheless making progress on their side.
Most determined is Oregon, which mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the nation&#39;s largest experiment.
These motorists will soon pay the state mileage charges instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois is attempting a trial on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in trucking in states along the US east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is exploring how it might implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently fitted their cars with a device, drivers were worried the government could track their every move.
&quot;The concerns about Big Brother and that kind of thing are a big deal,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, who leads strategic performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It&#39;s not something people want.
From the start of the trial, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices. »
There is no need to build a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people&#39;s daily comings and goings.
Nevada is one of a handful of states now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to track how many miles a car has traveled, but without knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to hire a small California start-up called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help motorists who pay taxes to the States.
It was looking to break into the emerging auto insurance market, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices she is testing have pleased highway planners because they don&#39;t use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
&quot;People will be more likely to do this if you don&#39;t log their speed and locate them,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.
Big mistakes were made in pilot programs in some states.
There are far less expensive ways and far less intrusive methods of doing this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a flat rate based on the average number of miles flown by all residents of the state.
Other states hope to sell the concept to wary citizens by allowing the devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transportation officials are looking to develop a charging device that would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide pay-as-you-go insurance, and create a real-time speed dataset. from other drivers that motorists might use to avoid traffic jams.
“Motorists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits the system offers them,” said an urban planning document.
However, some transportation planners wonder if the whole pay-per-mile debate is just a huge diversion.
At the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission, officials say Congress could very simply handle the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by raising gasoline taxes.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of gas, so that everyone pays their fair share.
&quot;There&#39;s no need for radical surgery when you just need aspirin,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, the commission&#39;s director of legislation and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
British police issue extradition warrant for Assange
British police today issued an extradition warrant for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and is seeking political asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had issued a &#39;surrender notice&#39; for the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not he would be likely to be stopped.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden over the sex crime allegations, having exhausted all possible avenues under UK law after the Supreme Court overturned an appeal he lodged against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would authorize his transfer to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has &#39;issued a surrender notice to a 40-year-old man who asks him to report to a police station, at a date and time of his choosing,&#39; a spokesperson said .
He continues to violate his bail conditions.
The Embassy declined to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be charged with espionage, after uncovering more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks site fighting against secret information.
Letta confident in the longevity of his government
Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta believes that his government will hold out until 2015 despite strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition as the Senate vote approaches to strip Silvio Berlusconi of his mandate.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the centre-left leader said he &quot;firmly intends&quot; to continue to govern with his coalition until the next legislative elections in 2015.
The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former Council president sentenced for tax evasion in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, pronounces his dismissal.
But part of his camp, grouped around the national secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2 last by his refusal to give in to the injunctions of Berlusconi who already wanted to drop the cabinet.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to observe strong dissatisfaction on the part of the people I meet: monstrous revaluation of their properties, deluge of taxes, cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs no more finish.
In short, unlimited siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of squandered dollars could be saved to allow taxation that is much respectful of those who pay.
Any money forcibly taken from taxpayers diminishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major businesses, we are not shy about lavish spending and the maintenance of lame ducks: loss-making cultural center, high subsidy to the Cité de l&#39;Énergie, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, sell them to private enterprise or demolish them.
It is also heartbreaking to see the expropriation of several properties to accommodate a major industry that never came.
However, I give an honorable mention to the transformation of the old Wabasso into a sort of industrial incubator, but at what cost for tax payers?
It is not up to the public levels to invest in such enterprises, but rather to the private sector, based on consumer demand.
Residents were pleased to learn that the à la Pêche and des Piles lakes will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
Following the departure of all industries (large water consumers) and the great decline of the population, the use of water has considerably decreased throughout the territory.
Without meaning to waste it, the city will never run out of water and the severe regulations regarding its use could be greatly softened.
In summary, it is very easy to achieve great things with other people&#39;s money.
I would be ashamed to defend such a record.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this town can&#39;t even buy a pen without going through a loan bylaw.
We have been managed for more than 40 years by ties with good diplomas for the most part and I do not believe that a sheep breeder does worse.
Worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks Thursday morning in Montreal.
The tragedy occurred around 11 a.m. on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the borough of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
In all likelihood, foundation work had been going on there for some time.
A party foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived at the site to retrieve his tools.
I was driving by and I saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the site.
I disembarked and went to remove the large bricks that covered it.
You could only see part of his back, it&#39;s so unfortunate.
Authorities say the victim is an elderly man in his 50s who worked for a formwork company.
Resuscitation maneuvers were attempted by the emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector from the Commission de la santé et de la sécurité du travail was dispatched to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.
NSA Blames &#39;Internal Error&#39;, Not Hackers For Site Crash
The behind-the-scenes National Security Agency said Friday it was a bug that caused its public site to go down for a few hours, not hackers as some claimed online.
&quot;NSA.gov was down for a few hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update,&quot; the spy agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Allegations that the outage was due to a Distributed Denial of Service [DSD] attack are false.
Earlier tonight, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users are still unable to access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency&#39;s sensitive internal network was &quot;not at all&quot; compromised.
No classified information is at risk, the spokesperson explained.
At least one group of online hacktivists has claimed responsibility for bringing down the NSA site with a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
The cyber tactics are not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The once top-secret NSA, once dubbed the “No Such Agency,” has found itself in the spotlight and heavily criticized in recent months following a spate of revelations about its extensive communications surveillance programs in domestically and abroad – which are part of secret NSA files stolen from the agency and leaked by disillusioned former NSA consultant Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency has caused much speculation that tonight&#39;s incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Among them, 200 have still not found a new job.
Delta promises not to let its employees down.
Employers came to meet employees directly on site, we met employees individually to assess their needs.
“This support will continue for the next six months,” explains the regional director of labor relations for Delta Hotels, Félix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta comes in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned that building had choices to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue to operate it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
&quot;Or either he sold it to someone else and that&#39;s what happened,&quot; explains Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Tourism Chair at UQAM&#39;s School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for the elderly.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will see the light of day over the next two years.
Fancy some neon ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world&#39;s first fluorescent ice cream made from jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He got the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the shiny protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by raising the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that since ice cream begins to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you lick, the glossier it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of &#39;Lick Me I&#39;m Delicious&#39; ice cream company, said: &quot;It&#39;s amazing stuff but we&#39;re still in the early stages in terms of production, and 2g of This stuff costs around £200. »
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth heats up the protein, the pH level rises and the ice cream starts to glow.
We&#39;ve been testing it over the past few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at Halloween time as it gives an amazing glowing effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice cream I have created because the luminescence of jellyfish is worth four times as much as gold.
So each scoop costs me around £140.
But she tastes pretty good!
Charlie&#39;s experimental company, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice cream flavors such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation promises to be even more ambitious.
He added: “I would really like to develop an invisible ice cream. »
It&#39;s inherently impossible due to the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think I&#39;ll find a way to make it happen.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
One seriously injured in an accident with a ghost driver on the Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury, Friday morning around 5:30 am, on the inner ring of Brussels at the height of Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo.
A female driver&#39;s car was hit by a phantom driver, who is unharmed.
The ring was closed to traffic until 9:00 a.m. at the site of the accident, while the road was cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation hardly caused any traffic jams because the accident took place near the Hoeilaart exit.
Traffic could therefore be diverted by this exit/entrance to the ring.
A child seriously injured in an attraction at Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child has been seriously injured following an accident on an attraction at Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer engaged but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a ship of the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; attraction.
It has been closed until further notice.
Snowden ready to &#39;cooperate&#39; with Germany on US surveillance issue
Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblower, said he was willing to travel to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he enjoys asylum, on Thursday to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr Snowden said: &quot;Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize political speech with accusations against which it is impossible to defend oneself. »
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to drop the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the US Department of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany&#39;s interior minister, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will work to make this possible. »
Relations between the United States and Germany have been strained following complaints that the NSA tapped German Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who leads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign intelligence, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr Snowden as a witness &quot;without putting him in danger and completely ruining relations with the States United&quot;, we had to take advantage of it.
Mr. Ströbele, German Green MP, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Ströbele said that according to the lawyer for the former NSA consultant, Mr Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden gave evidence in Germany, he would have to be given assurances that he would be “safe” there, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a “severe and sustained” campaign of persecution which had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he was encouraged by the global reaction to &quot;my act of political expression&quot;.
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials – including in the United States – judged that the exposure of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was in the public interest.
The letter advances an offer of cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved”.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new species of humpback dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, scientific officer at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Marine Animals and Environments (OCEAMM) returns for L&#39;Express to this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin surprise you?
This is good news, but it does not particularly surprise me.
If in the past, species were described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allow us to improve our scientific knowledge of the classification of species.
It is also not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology call into question the classification or membership of a species in a genus, a family, or even an order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are challenged due to advances in genetics.
In the same way, two species very close morphologically have been distinguished thanks to genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
About ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: the Pacific humpback dolphins and the Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyzes have identified four species.
Why is this a significant discovery as claimed by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population had already been known to researchers for a long time, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only at this location.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture arises in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local disappearance of a population of a species more widely distributed on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered depending on the number of individuals existing on Earth, ie the stock, and the possibility it has of recovering from neighboring stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, from which the population of the newly discovered species is derived, its stock has automatically become lower, thus making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This mixing of genes limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can ultimately lead to the creation of new species.
You should know that the marine environment is the least well known environment.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, than to know what lives in the Mariana Trench, just 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
More money is spent on the search for life on other planets than on marine research and it is high time that this changed.
Clive Palmer claims MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and take advantage of it.
The mining magnate, who is challenging the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, has made this argument to try to sideline questions about a potential conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be scrapped.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott&#39;s daughters stand to personally benefit from these policies.
“He will have a significant conflict of interest when it comes to paying for parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant he will have a vested interest in whether or not she gets leave,” said Mr Palmer.
Two months after his election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr Palmer won the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes, after a recount.
Mr. Palmer floated the idea of overhauling the vote counting system to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott&#39;s daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the voting is over?
&quot;We need a better system,&quot; he said.
Why can&#39;t we have a system where you can log in, put your details into a computer, vote immediately, and have the result by 6:30 the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark the ballots.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone does not agree?
Nowadays, having a pencil seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has explored options for electronic voting and recently released a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his political plan included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new role &quot;very seriously&quot;.
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
&quot;We are not looking for any reward except the story reward because we have to serve the community at a critical time,&quot; he added.
When a host of equestrian event experts gathered in Cardiff to battle it out for the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be tough.
But no one expected three-year-old Fenton Kirkland to win.
Not yet in school and only a few months after cutting his teeth, the toddler and his Shetland pony Toffee trotted through the three laps with great ease and won the top prize, leaving the other 30 competitors behind. adults.
The two lovebirds - who are the same size - were hailed for presentation, attitude and style at the annual show held at Sunnybank Equestrian Center in Rudry near Cardiff.
Pitching against men and women in smart bowler hats, he wore his flat cap a little to the side casually to parade his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural dressage qualities that were uncommon for a child of his age.
And Toffee received high marks for her presentation and personality.
Fenton got Toffee as a gift for his 3rd birthday last March and has been training with his Shetland pony every day since.
Her mother Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee make a great pair. »
They showed up against all odds, but both won the gold cup and the rosette.
It was only his second time competing with Toffee and we were overjoyed that he won.
On the track, people who didn&#39;t know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to have their picture taken with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale in South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been competing in equestrian competitions for over 10 years.
Ms Howells said: “There was electricity in the air and everyone was cheering for her and applauding her. »
He ran the full length of the track and even though he looked tiny, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the countryside and has two chickens to look after.
The way he started, he will surely soon be competing in the Horse of the Year event – and I&#39;m sure he will put in a good showing.
A spokesperson for the annual equestrian event said: “Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to ride his pony. »
They make a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee presented well and the way they walked down the runway.
They look for effective teamwork between pony and trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I&#39;m sure his nice clothes helped Fenton, he looked really good.
Defense Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that injured soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before returning to civilian life. .
Attacked by the Liberals and New Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that before their release, the members of the army followed a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive proper care in preparation for their return to civilian life and none of them are released until they are ready, he said.
Critics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured service members - who do not meet the military&#39;s &#39;universality of service&#39; rule requiring personnel to be able to perform a varied series of tasks - to reach the 10-year qualifying period required for retirement benefits.
They notably cited two cases reported by The Canadian Press, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ont., who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, was released from the military despite his request to stay on for another year so he could receive a fully indexed pension.
His case came after that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he was pushed out before he was ready because he did not meet the universality rule. of service.
Mr Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and counseling sessions, but that was totally different from wanting to leave the ranks.
&quot;I told them I wasn&#39;t ready,&quot; he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the start of major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has struggled to determine how much leeway it can give to wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks, but who are not combat-capable.
Under current rules, seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployments, they may be forced out of the military.
Data presented to Parliament last year shows that of the 1,218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the length of service required to obtain pension benefits.
Liberal veterans affairs critic Jim Karygiannis on Wednesday called for the reinstatement of Corporal Hawkins, while New Democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to &quot;this shameful practice.&quot;
Airstrike against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli planes entered Lebanese airspace early Wednesday afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A shipment of SA-8 short-range surface-to-air missiles was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
This new raid by Tsahal aircraft on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in much the same circumstances as the one on July 5: at the time, it was also an anonymous American official who confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont surface-to-sea missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had made no secret of their irritation at seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Life imprisonment for a former Chinese vice-governor
A former vice-governor of Jilin province in northeast China was sentenced to life in prison on Friday for corruption.
Expelled from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of receiving more than 19 million yuan in bribes, state media reported.
Between 1995 and 2001, the vice-governor, who was also the president of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped companies and officials obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, said the first Beijing Intermediate Court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, has made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon poses a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the Head of State promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful &quot;tigers&quot; as with the &quot;flies&quot; - the subordinate officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials have been convicted, including former executives of oil giant Petrochina.
The most dramatic recent case was that of former CCP chief in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest state positions.
But the government has shown no intention of reforming the anti-corruption system, for example by creating an organization independent of the party.
Bombardier&#39;s profit down as aircraft deliveries and orders fall
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and railroad maker, reported a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday, pressured by a drop in aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues at its Trains division .
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not provide flight test data for its all-new CSeries aircraft or information on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious schedule for entry into commercial service before next September.
After the test aircraft&#39;s maiden flight about a month and a half ago, it only flew three times, and the question then arose whether the test phase was on track. .
Results fell short of expectations and share prices fell 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
National Bank Financial analyst Cameron Doerksen on Thursday downgraded his rating from &quot;outperform&quot; to &quot;sector performer&quot; due to the stock market&#39;s weak upside potential over the next quarter or two quarters.
“While the decline in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are very disappointed with the profit margin in the Transportation division,” Cameron Doerksen said in a note to clients.
We believe that Bombardier will register new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the next few months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries family of aircraft can catapult it into the lower end of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for the CSeries aircraft is modest so far at 177. It appears that potential buyers are awaiting flight test results to validate the company&#39;s claims about fuel efficiency and fuel efficiency. savings of the new airliner.
At present, the company has registered a total of 403 purchase orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is confident that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 firm orders before the first aircraft enters commercial service.
Executives also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was progressing according to schedule.
“The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” Beaudoin said on a conference call, adding that ground testing and software updates were planned during the time of the test. plane stop.
Each builder plans differently.
We had decided to do a first flight and plan an update period, and that&#39;s what we did.
This will reoccur throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the others to follow soon after, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical that the first customer will be able to fly a CSeries aircraft just 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier said it is evaluating the entry-into-service schedule and will provide further information over the coming months.
“This slow flight testing – although apparently in line with Bombardier&#39;s internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be pushed back to the first quarter of 2015,” Mr. Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended Sept. 30, Bombardier&#39;s net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues fell slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents a share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world&#39;s fourth-largest aircraft maker said it delivered 45 planes in the quarter, up from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft from 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautics division represented $32.9 billion as of September 30, a figure unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
&quot;In Aerospace, results were in line with our expectations, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing,&quot; said Mr. Beaudoin.
Aerospace revenues fell 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world&#39;s largest rail maker, said revenue from that division rose nearly 11% to $2.1 billion.
The Transportation Division&#39;s backlog totaled $32.6 billion as of September 30, up slightly from December 31 of the previous year.
The Transportation division&#39;s margins suffered from execution problems on a few large contracts.
Executives announced that further guidance would be provided during the fourth quarter.
The stock price of Bombardier, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, chief financial officer of Google Inc, would serve on the board, fell 8.5% to C$4.83 in the afternoon. of Thursday.
Brazil&#39;s Embraer SA, the world&#39;s third-largest aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier&#39;s closest competitor, reported a 10% drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Kenyan press outraged over controversial media law
“It is a scary country and it is legitimate to ask the following question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow? the newspaper said, challenging the bill and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional.
“This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya&#39;s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media court “will always be biased because it is an extension of the government” and that restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya&#39;s place in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to parliamentarians,” he added.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will allow the government to have &quot;control over the media&quot;. The Standard meanwhile reported that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya &quot;had suffered a severe blow&quot; and slammed the bill as &quot;draconian&quot;.
The bill&#39;s passage comes amid a package of measures to bolster national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists at the Westgate shopping center last September.
Kenyan media has angered authorities by releasing CCTV footage showing troops deployed to the scene of the attack allegedly robbing the luxury mall.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the summons was withdrawn following a media outcry.
Under the new bill, media could be subject to fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being &quot;barred&quot; or no longer able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single fine is enough to cripple most FM stations”.
He also says the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya&#39;s &quot;bustling blogosphere&quot;.
By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they want with impunity.
&quot;No one will ever know,&quot; wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist with The Nation, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
“Left to their own devices, politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering. »
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of popular anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against cuts ordered by the National Wage Commission and restored their staggering salaries of around 532,000 tax-free shillings a month – among the highest in the world.
Two cavers aged 23 and 27 had been missing in a chasm under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday evening, we learned on Friday from the Isère Speleo Rescue.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one experienced in practice and the other not, had gone underground Thursday around 9:30 p.m. to cross the Dent de Crolles, located in the town of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We hadn&#39;t heard from them since, said the same source.
&quot;The speleologists should have come out around 5 a.m.,&quot; said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser at Caving Rescue in charge of organizing the rescue.
Dozens of people on site
About twenty rescuers, ten civilian members of the French Caving Rescue, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on site.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two cavers were located.
“It was another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but in good health in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the rescue teams involved in the network” explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers in the 13th battalion of the Chambéry Alpine Hunters were found &quot;exhausted, but not injured&quot;.
They got lost in the network, retraced their steps while waiting for help, said the prefecture.
Resupplied, they should come out of the cavity with the help of rescuers in the evening.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his Suburb Party
Above all, make no mistake.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the &quot;Party of the suburbs&quot; is not only aimed at suburbanites.
I chose a map of France as a logo, he justifies.
When I speak of the suburbs, I am addressing all those who are excluded from the great national family.
Nevertheless, his project, presented Thursday at a press conference in his native town of Aubervilliers, was born from the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot which characterizes above all the districts.
My No. 1 proposal is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, territorial attaché, claims today as &quot;100% apolitical&quot; even if he has not always been neutral.
Activist in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then locally supported Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are attached to the left, but if people on the right are ready to support me, I will listen to them too, he continues.
It&#39;s only to extremist parties that I don&#39;t speak.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his program - which can be consulted on the Internet - from many themes that are supposed to speak to suburban residents and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, civil majority 16 years, the rehabilitation of the function of building caretaker...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene. &quot;For the municipal elections of 2014, it may be fair, he admits.&quot;
It is a problem of time and money.
The Party of the suburbs should nevertheless be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune claims to have already seven top candidates in mainland France and Martinique.
“And the support emails that I have received since yesterday do not all come from the suburbs,” he rejoices.
Vibrant tribute paid to veterans in Menton
In the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as numerous patriotic associations, paid tribute this Friday afternoon to the soldiers and deceased of all wars.
Wreaths were laid in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by Deputy Mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Foreign workers with a 457 visa may have to pass an &#39;authenticity&#39; test
The government is currently exploring the possibility of introducing an “authenticity” test for foreign workers with 457 visas as it plans to expand the crackdown.
The test, if passed, would be applied under a test intended to prevent 457 visas from being used to fill unskilled positions or as a backdoor to bring family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today as Labor MP Maxine McKew denounced the government&#39;s rhetoric on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia&#39;s neighbours.
&quot;The resounding statements about &#39;foreigners going back to the end of the line&#39; and &#39;jobs for Australians first&#39; are a nasty throwback to the days when unions demanded a protected labor market,&quot; she said. told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of white people had to be protected – and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo of this historical artifact.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that had previously been considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O&#39;Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials to discuss human trafficking, has implemented five of the recommended changes, with the others under review.
If the &quot;authenticity&quot; criterion were adopted, a visa applicant could be screened &quot;whether the job offer is genuine where the applicant is a personal relation or associate of the owner or person concerned. within the sponsoring company.
Companies could also be required to report the number of 457 visa holders after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker is believed to have died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The man&#39;s distraught 9-year-old son was traveling to Australia with him and has found some solace since his father&#39;s death on Wednesday from an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was rushed by Australian authorities to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
Challenging abortion rights in Texas
A federal appeals court in Texas has reinstated certain restrictions on the right to terminate a pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This judgment means that a text of law adopted in July in this State and largely calling into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The ruling by the Court of Appeal means that doctors who perform abortions will have to have a &quot;privilege of admission&quot; to local hospitals.
Admitting privilege is the right of a physician, by virtue of his status as a nursing member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical center for the purpose of providing diagnosis or treatment.
Abortion advocates argue that the content of the law could result in the immediate closure of a third of state clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this &quot;admission privilege&quot; for their practitioners.
In total, it would be nearly 22,000 women who would be deprived of access to these establishments.
On Monday, a trial judge ruled on the eve of the law&#39;s entry into force that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional.
But the Attorney General of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is running for governor, asked the appeals court to overturn the trial judgment that blocked the application of the law.
A full hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
Oracle shareholders angered by Ellison&#39;s salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders on Thursday voted against the compensation proposal for founder and chief executive Larry Ellison, given his group&#39;s financial performance.
The vote is not binding but tarnishes the image of Larry Ellison, the world&#39;s third-richest man just crowned with his boat&#39;s victory in the America&#39;s Cup.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Already last year, Ellison had suffered a negative vote on his remuneration.
Oracle boss forfeited $1.2m bonus for 2013 fiscal year ending May due to poor performance as the group missed growth targets but received around $77m related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the entire staggered 2013 financial year, Oracle&#39;s net profit increased by 3.5% while the stock market price jumped by 27.5%, outperforming the S&amp;P-500 index which gained 24% at the same time.
The tests carried out by the Institut Pasteur on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus turned out to be negative, announced the Ministry of Health.
He specifies that &quot;the two cases identified in May 2013 therefore remain the only two cases confirmed in France to date&quot;.
On Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient was suspected of being affected, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed around fifty people.
The 22-year-old supermodel does not start her film career through the back door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to play young Charlotte Gainsbourg in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This pornographic drama recounts, in eight chapters which will be released in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a forties addicted to sex since her adolescence.
Stacy Martin&#39;s resemblance to her eldest is striking: a twig-like silhouette, a diaphanous complexion and Franco-English origins.
Without forgetting a certain taste for risk: the one who had not hesitated to pose naked on glossy paper will appear in much more sulphurous situations on the big screen.
An excerpt from Nymphomaniac has raised the temperature on the Web: Stacy Martin appears there in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their modesty in the closet, he called on porn professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all the bodies digitally: above the belt, c is the star; below, the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, via Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has a habit of pushing his actresses to their limits, always for the best.
Stacy Martin has not finished talking about her.
It&#39;s been five years since my father disappeared from the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him in present tense,
I was so afraid of forgetting him or rather I didn&#39;t know how I was going to continue to &quot;visit&quot; him.
There is no recipe, no instructions for passing the invisible wall and finding your loved ones.
Then signs appeared.
The first time was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to look at his watch which never leaves me, placed on the bedside table.
It is the image of my smiling father who accompanies me in my daily actions.
Our mother passed away after her grueling battle with cancer.
At least that&#39;s what I thought the day I found his body empty, tense on this hospital bed with crumpled sheets.
Likewise, his funeral was a chilling farewell focused around the dim candlelight that framed his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little, in small daytime or nighttime appearances, a little shy, a little erased, she quickly came back to my mind, evolving as she took her place back in the landscape of my thoughts, which believed itself to be in mourning. .
And then, she revealed herself while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had in no way lost the person of my mother but simply a woman that I didn&#39;t really know, a woman who embodied this person during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and now I found her, full and whole.
This detour in the path of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, &quot;inside and out&quot; it seems.
I&#39;ve always been told that.
I never believed him at the time.
I had a difficult relationship with him until he became old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I was able to love him.
One day he died.
For a long time, it accompanied me: when I quit smoking, when I was scared, when I was in pain...
He spoke to me, constantly encouraged me, he inhabited my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I was able to have a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It lasted a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don&#39;t remember who said that dead people are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no more but I constantly feel them close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to them: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I dream of them constantly, maybe not every night but several times a week for sure.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it&#39;s too late, only there is always something that prevents me from accomplishing this moment.
I often wake up anxious when this happens to me and I deeply feel their absence.
Sometimes, certain dreams carry me on the contrary and are part of my story and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
The day before my ultrasound where I was to find out the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I woke up, I climbed out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the landing and he was smiling at me and happy that I was waiting a little boy.
The next day, I felt like he had visited me in my sleep to let me know that he was happy to share what was happening to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I enjoyed sharing this moment with him and I take pleasure in recounting this common memory lived after his death.
Exactly five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year before, she was on a trip with my family to Cuba.
This shows the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bachelor that I was at the time.
Despite everything, I realized my mourning quite quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially in times when I find myself in difficulty, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and taking an interest in the Middle East, to the point of doing a master&#39;s degree in a major school, were not, with hindsight, trivial choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she instilled in me are still present, so that I sometimes think about how she would like me to act at a given moment.
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and righteousness of spirit of someone who was a fervent believer.
From now on, I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I see his eyes land on me.
My mother passed away nineteen years ago now.
Died after talking to me on the phone.
I went through all the phases: incomprehension, anger, pain, crying that started on its own, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then time eased the pain.
Only lack remained, this unanswered void, this need for her, to confide in me, to reassure me in the depths of her sweetness.
However, she is there, a silent presence, she is there and looks at me.
Every morning, I see his worried eyes resting on me, I see the dark circles that make his gaze heavy, the fine lines around his lips hollowed out by cigarettes, the folds that mark his forehead on days of worry.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I look away.
My wife and the mother of my 3 children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We constantly feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually learned to smile again, and pronouncing his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I speak to her in the hollow of the night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when my morale is a little low.
We feel supported and protected in difficult times, the hindsight of time makes us realize how much she was a conductor and we try to stay on the path she had traced for us.
If someone has loved you very dearly, absence cannot snatch it from your heart and memories.
In a way, the loved one becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 to asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I was unable to attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a baby boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are consistent with his vision of things.
I have also had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it&#39;s impossible to go in the opposite direction, I can&#39;t sleep and I always wonder what he will think of it.
I don&#39;t know if I adopted his way of being or if I&#39;m just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, he will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk between us.
In short, he is there every day.
I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
It has been almost thirty years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 and our son was 6.
The immense pain that then invaded me has of course lessened but he is still close to me.
Very often it &quot;appears&quot; in my dreams in such a precise, vivid way that when I wake up I am even sadder to realize that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was fine, I told him no, he replied &quot;I&#39;m going down&quot; but in such a real voice that I woke up with a start, anxious and I turned on the bedside lamp, looking everywhere, convinced that he was coming.
I still live in the same house, and often I feel watched and I turn around to see if he&#39;s not there, I know it&#39;s him and I talk to him.
In all the rooms I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world would I leave this house where we were happy and where his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since his departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a job with responsibility, I laugh and I sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have lots of friends, but my heart and my soul belong to him and I never speak of him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Horse in beef products
Horsemeat has been detected in tins of beef products sold by two small UK retail chains at low prices, the food safety agency announced today.
Routine tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained 1 to 5% horse DNA.
&quot;As horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product,&quot; explained the British agency.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in ready meals erupted in Europe at the start of the year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to reviews by the European Commission, France has been the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products supposed to contain only beef.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was Iraq&#39;s deadliest month since April 2008.
Baghdad released official figures on Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the American President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
&quot;We are not telling the world to stand by us and support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it,&quot; Al-Maliki said Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not resolved, it will spread, and what is happening in Syria will also spread.
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki was speaking at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, demonstrators were protesting against the Iraqi leader.
They held up signs accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with aid.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without their trump card, the Swede Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announced the Ligue 1 club in a press release.
PSG, leader of the championship ahead of Monaco on goal difference, has released the list of players selected for this match of the 12th day, without including the 32-year-old striker.
The statement simply states that he is &quot;injured&quot;, without specifying the nature of the injury.
He nevertheless suffered from an inflammation of the left knee when he returned from selection at the beginning of the month.
Mick Jagger says he never hit on Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a backing vocalist on Jagger&#39;s song &#39;Old Habits Die Hard&#39; in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, &quot;he hit on me when I was 18.&quot;
She added, “It was a long time ago, and he was very nice. »
In a statement Thursday, a rep for Jagger, 70, said he &quot;categorically denies making any advances to Katy Perry.&quot;
The rep added, “Maybe she’s confusing him with someone else. »
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album, “Prism,” landed at number one on the charts this week.
Clashes between Palestinians and Israelis on the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured Thursday evening, October 31, 2013 during a violent clash on the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased operation on Friday (November 1st) after its fuel stocks ran out, the Palestinian enclave&#39;s Energy Authority announced.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another cadre of Hamas&#39; armed wing, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by tank shelling during an Israeli army incursion into east of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local Al-Qassam Brigades leaders, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer made an incursion of a hundred meters inside the territory before then withdrawing.
The clash lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abou Zouhri, paid tribute to the four &quot;heroes&quot; and claimed that Israeli soldiers had died during the confrontation.
Hamas commends the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell defending the territory during an incursion by the Zionist occupier into Khan Younis.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
&quot;Hamas assures that Gaza will be hell for the occupier,&quot; threatened the spokesman.
For its part, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7 and intended, according to the army, for &quot;terrorist activities&quot;.
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight against Israel, specifying that the aim was to kidnap Israeli soldiers to exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, an Israeli military statement explained.
During the operation, Hamas detonated an explosive device targeting IDF forces (Israeli army) and injured 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
&quot;This mission was imperative because of the risk of the terrorist tunnel being used for attacks against Israeli civilians,&quot; army spokesman Peter Lerner said.
Separately, Israel struck a military air base in northwestern Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles intended for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, the Al-Arabiya satellite channel reported on Thursday (October 31st).
A US official confirmed an &quot;Israeli strike&quot; but did not give details of the target.
&quot;In the past, the targets have been missiles transferred to Hezbollah,&quot; he added.
Israeli government officials have declined to confirm any reports of such an attack.
Citing &quot;exclusive sources&quot; which it did not name, the Saudi-owned channel said &quot;the bombardment targeted a shipment of surface-to-air missiles which was destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon&quot;, in reference to the powerful Shiite movement Lebanese who is fighting the rebels alongside the Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, had reported several explosions heard Wednesday at dawn at an air defense base in Sonar Jablé, near Latakia, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, based on a network of activists and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Disney relies on tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to favor tablets over its own television channels for the upcoming release of a new children&#39;s series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie&#39;s Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its app for phones and tablets.
Its worldwide launch on the Disney group&#39;s channels is only scheduled for 2014, details the press release from its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, aimed at children aged 2 to 7, tells the adventures of the cat Callie, sheriff of a town in the American West where she maintains order with a magic lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
&quot;Interacting with smartphones and tablets is second nature to children today,&quot; Albert Cheng, vice president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group, said in the statement.
This type of experience is part of Disney&#39;s efforts to &quot;extend the life of its series and build new relationships with its audience through increasingly important digital platforms&quot;, he said. added.
A survey released earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under the age of 2 have already used a tablet or a phone. , and 72% of children under 8, compared to 10% and 38% respectively two years ago.
Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The biker, Jonathan, 26, from Fléron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the rapid intervention of the emergency services, he died during this frontal collision.
The United States in Halloween colors
In the United States, President Obama has not deviated from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife, last night, he distributed treats to hundreds of children invited to the gardens of the White House in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivities on the US east coast were canceled due to Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the revelers have therefore caught up.
In New York, thousands of people in costume took part in the parade organized in the district of &quot;Greenwich village&quot;.
Everyone is over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
Me, I was finally able to put on the costume that I had planned last year.
We&#39;re having a blast, adds Rhonda.
People are happy.
It&#39;s good kid, it&#39;s cool.
We really need that.
Halloween is a pagan festival celebrated on the eve of All Saints&#39; Day, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
The island of Pitcairn wishes to create the largest marine reserve in the world, the daily newspaper Les Nouvelles de Tahiti announced on Thursday, taking up information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if we count three other small nearby islands.
It has been British since its occupation in 1790 by the mutineers of the Bounty, an episode in the history of the English navy which gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutineers, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends 95% on the generosity of London.
The Island Council voted unanimously in favor of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, ie 836,000 km2 which correspond to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Great Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctuarize these 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to ensure its surveillance, which is not the case.
There is no airport on Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to surveillance of the area there, and there is no port to place military surveillance ships.
As for France, it must already carry out the very costly aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the EEZ of French Polynesia, neighboring Pitcairn.
Greece: two dead in a shooting near a local neo-Nazi party
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured on Friday night when two people were fired from a motorbike that passed a premises of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party in the western suburbs of Athens, we learned from a police source.
The police were not in a position for the moment to give information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn claimed the victims were guards at their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police officers from the anti-terrorist service rushed to the central avenue of the Neo Iraklio suburb, where the incident took place, and cordoned off the area.
The incident comes weeks after six Golden Dawn MPs, including the party&#39;s leader and founder, were charged with participating in &quot;a criminal organization&quot; in an offensive against the party launched after the death of an antifascist musician by one of its members.
Parents of Georgia teenager who died in unusual circumstances believe their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgia teenager, whose body was found in a rolled-up wrestling mat in his high school gymnasium, believe their son was murdered, the family&#39;s attorney said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Georgia, was found Jan. 11 trapped in a propped up mat behind the bleachers of his high school gymnasium.
Lowndes County Sheriff&#39;s investigators have concluded Johnson died in unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old&#39;s family disputes those findings.
“They are absolutely certain their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, the attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as stated in the sheriff&#39;s findings.
&quot;They think it defies all logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense,&quot; Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered for the sole purpose of covering up the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a satchel and they returned him in a body bag,” he added.
United States Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson&#39;s death, noting that several important questions remain unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I will follow up on the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
&quot;I consider that there is a sufficient basis&quot; to open a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated Johnson died of &quot;positional asphyxiation.&quot;
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
“Several questions still deserve an answer or confirmation,” he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers anything that warrants a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson&#39;s death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative from the Lowndes County Sheriff&#39;s Office was unavailable to give us his opinion when we contacted him Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to turn over all CCTV footage that investigators had reviewed.
The teenager&#39;s parents said they hope the video footage contains clues to the circumstances of his death.
Ex-Gestapo chief buried in Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without ever being found, was in fact buried in a mass grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the head of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
&quot;His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte,&quot; he told the widely circulated daily, based on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would answer one of the great enigmas of the post-war period.
The German secret services, the BND, thus ensured that during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The Secret Service was totally wrong.
&quot;As early as August 1945, Müller&#39;s body was found in a temporary grave near the former Reich Ministry of Aviation by a commando&quot;, according to Mr. Tuchel.
He wore &quot;a general&#39;s uniform&quot;.
&quot;In the inside left pocket were his service records with a photo,&quot; he continues.
Bild also publishes a document from the borough hall of Berlin&#39;s Mitte district stating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery in the district.
The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, said he was shocked by this revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormity in bad taste.
&quot;We grossly trample the memory of the victims,&quot; he protested in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important figures of the Third Reich who have never been captured.
He took part in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the &quot;final solution&quot; and had in particular under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the &quot;logistics&quot; of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962 .
Egypt asks first freely elected president to be sworn in
Mohamed Morsi has taken the oath of office, but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark the end of political strife in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a &#39;new Egypt&#39; when he took the oath of office as president, becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted for 16 months earlier.
Upon his inauguration in the High Constitutional Court, Mr Morsi also became the Arab world&#39;s first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt&#39;s fifth head of state since the monarchy was overthrown 60 years ago.
He was sworn in before the 18 black-robed judges of the Court whose building on the banks of the Nile was built to look like an Egyptian temple.
“We yearn for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,” President Morsi said during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
“Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old US-educated engineer from the Brotherhood. Muslims, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and harshly repressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the Court to cheer on the new President and, in contrast to the presidential pomp of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow his convoy to pass through the busy streets linking the city center to the southern suburbs.
Seen as the uncharismatic &quot;spare wheel&quot; of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has been considerably boosted since his victory and his speech on Friday in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work started during the 2011 uprising against authoritarian President Mubarak.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Mohamed Morsi, in a blue suit and red tie, addressing the judges present in the ornate paneled room where he was sworn in.
Later, Mr. Morsi visited Cairo University where he delivered his inaugural speech.
He was officially greeted by a military band that played the national anthem as he stood to attention.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song &quot;The people and the army, hand in hand...&quot; sung by thousands of people gathered in the large amphitheater of the university.
Founded in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mr Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak&#39;s authoritarian rule last year originated, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers including the military council, which has replaced the ousted former president, dispossessed him.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as is customary, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi&#39;s speech in Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
Aircraft makers squabble over seat width amid big orders at stake
The row rages between major aircraft manufacturers over the width of economy class seats on long-haul flights, setting the stage for a bitter showdown at the Dubai Airshow which takes place this month.
The dispute centers on the width of seats offered on long-haul flights to Economy Class passengers – who are not always the most courted by airlines, but for whom allocated space is essential to increase efficiencies in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called on the aviation industry to introduce a standard requiring a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72cm) in economy classes, but arch-rival US Boeing says it should be airlines to decide.
The dispute has erupted as aircraft manufacturers seek to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul planes, hoping for an eventual order record at the Nov. 17-21 event.
The way the seats will be arranged at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, will there be 9 or 10 seats abreast – is essential for the economic return of the “mini-jumbo” segment.
Boeing says its refitted &quot;777X&quot; will accommodate economy class 406 people in seats more than 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch-wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aerospace giants often trade blows on technical issues while advertising in the trade press.
Today, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to overtake rivals with more than 100 orders.
We recently realized what could be the start of a new advertising war with the presentation to financiers of a photo showing three people against each other in a restaurant, entitled “Would you accept that? &quot;.
“Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than in regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leahy, chief commercial officer of Airbus.
As eating habits change, people get fatter, but airplane seats haven&#39;t changed drastically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing&#39;s 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American aged 40 to 49 increased by 10%, according to data from the US Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the average 21st century American is 39.7 inches, according to US health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is clinging to a seat concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly dubbed &quot;jet set&quot; aircraft was narrower.
Airbus adds that it has commissioned a study which indicates that an extra inch in seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing disputes Airbus&#39; figures for seat width and says it&#39;s not up to manufacturers how airlines balance ticket prices and amenities.
He also says the study shows that the cabin experience isn&#39;t just about seat width.
&quot;It&#39;s really about giving flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to run their business,&quot; said Kent Craver, passenger satisfaction manager at Boeing.
They don&#39;t want to be told what will allow them to be profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers it&#39;s more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers it&#39;s increasingly an issue that could affect their bottom line.
Behind the dispute lies a race to order planes worth an estimated $700 billion at market price in the coming decades, enough to tip the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seating configuration is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a per-seat efficiency in their latest long-haul twin-engine models that is 20% better than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing&#39;s advertised performance depends in part on comparing the 777X configured with 10 seats per row to an original 777 model configured in rows of 9.
The gain in terms of unit costs is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
&quot;Boeing is doing this to be able to squeeze in more seats and make its planes more competitive with our products,&quot; said Kevin Keniston, passenger comfort director at European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say cabins configured with 10 seats per row in existing 777s suggest that many passengers are in favor of a denser configuration, which can come with cheaper fares.
&quot;An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a business perspective, Airbus&#39; proposal is driven by the threat of the 777,&quot; said cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers from which airlines must choose.
Aircraft salesmen who fly around the world even carry a tape measure with them to check competing configurations.
While boasting of offering comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus is offering an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but says it hasn&#39;t sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for greater cabin customization by offering wider aisle seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the backing of the only other major maker of modern large aircraft, experts say its appeal to the aviation industry to introduce a size standard for seats is unlikely to succeed, but could make forget the wave of sales of 777X.
Guillaume Nicloux&#39;s adaptation of Denis Diderot&#39;s novel boasts remarkable art direction and careful period reconstruction, but it&#39;s also more labor-intensive than it should be.
Set in 1760s France, it tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the unbridled cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Mother Superior and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never veers into lewdness or sensationalism, and that&#39;s the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narration could also become a penance for the public.
The musical, this beast of the stage
Classic, sophisticated, popular, in English or in French, the sung and danced productions are taking off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It&#39;s a revolution: the French musical asserts itself as a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most attempts were entangled in ridicule.
And successes like Cabaret or Les Miserables wore the halo of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at Châtelet and Stage Entertainment at Mogador changed the situation.
Today, these two scenes handle titles like hits.
The first resumes, this Christmas, its excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following the world premiere of &quot;An American in Paris&quot;.
In Mogador, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; could well be one of the successes of the season.
On the other stages, musical shows like &quot;1789&quot;, &quot;les amants de la Bastille&quot; and small musicals like &quot;Disco&quot; or &quot;Life and Times&quot; are in tune with success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book &quot;Stories of musical comedies&quot; and lecturer at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyzes the reasons for the hard-won success.
How are French musicals evolving?
The offer has multiplied.
First there are the &quot;musical shows&quot; which evolve according to the producers...
Some use beautiful image projections and a real story as in 1789, les Amants de la Bastille.
Others jump back fifteen years on the pretext that you can serve just about anything when you have Matt Pokora as the headliner.
Afterwards, we have the musicals with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet which make us relive the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes variety Anglo-Saxon musical comedies by adapting them into French.
Independent French producers are trying to break through.
But current projects like &quot;Rent&quot;, &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; or &quot;Spring Awakening&quot; are struggling to get funding.
Do we have enough capable artists like on Broadway to sing, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it&#39;s a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who rotate from project to project.
In the United States, the birthplace of the musical, it is very different.
Young people are trained in these trades in many schools.
There are many jobs between regional theaters, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The talent pool is as large as the number of vacancies.
Why are tours in the provinces so successful?
With the exception of opera, the provinces remain the poor relation of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often boulevard theater aimed at adults and not young adults.
Musical performances fill this gap.
These are the same young people who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Proposing handsome young men (often talented) as headliners for a musical show is the guarantee of a craze for these young girls and often for their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are expertly maintained by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are eagerly awaited when they arrive in a provincial Zenith.
The mayonnaise is mounted in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the major venues in France in the same form as in Paris.
Tokyo Stock Exchange ends down 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rating suffered from the decline of the dollar against the yen, detrimental to export values and the warning on its annual result issued by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14,201.57 and the Topix fell 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.

Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival : The New Yorker
You could say that New York City is where stand-up comedy was born in America: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of master of ceremonies at the Palace Theater, on Broadway, started telling jokes directly in front of the audience, in a conversational tone.
Fay&#39;s innovation has continued over the years, until it was picked up more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theaters.
&quot;Most of the headliners emerged at the Carolinas, and were very successful, until they became too famous to play in a club,&quot; Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year&#39;s event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of &quot;Stand Up for Heroes&quot;, an evening of comedy and music to benefit veterans, held at Madison Square Garden, at which will be present, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has grown, and so has the world of comedy.
Many of the comedians taking part in this year&#39;s festival have gone through non-traditional channels, such as presenting shows on small television stations, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll burst onto the scene in a cable sitcom (“The League” on FXX&#39;s gleefully lascivious fantasy football theme) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate has been on Saturday Night Live and cast in Parks and Recreation, but is best known for her viral &quot;Marcel the Shell with Shoes On&quot; video series.
Kroll and Slate, along with other young comedians with singular voices (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest draws to the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a stand-up comedian, but has become an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called &quot;Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg&quot;.
The meeting takes place at City Hall in midtown Manhattan.
&quot;The city is definitely in the comedic DNA of all of Larry&#39;s work,&quot; Steinberg said.
He used to tell me that when he was here, sometimes he would walk down an alley between two buildings and think to himself, Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I&#39;ll come live here.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railroad
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical track systems, has been discovered.
US authorities described the 4-by-3-foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagging a length equivalent to nearly six football fields long, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, United States.
The area is full of nondescript warehouses, making it easy to conceal trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs escaped unnoticed, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who authorities say worked as drivers have been charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They face a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers exploit vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge for drug cartels to get their products to consumers quickly.
In 2010, authorities found a passage about 700 yards with railroad tracks that ran from the kitchen of a Tijuana home to two warehouses in San Diego.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, says watchdog
Syria has destroyed critical equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas-filled ammunition, the international chemical weapons watchdog said on Thursday, as heavy clashes raged in the nearby north of the country. from one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored.
A Syrian militant group also said Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the country&#39;s civil war began nearly 3 years ago.
The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) announcement came a day ahead of the deadline for the
November 1 set by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or “render inoperable” all chemical weapons production units and machinery for mixing poison gas and filling munitions.
The completion of what is essentially the initial destruction phase is a milestone in the ambitious timetable to destroy Damascus&#39; chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Thanks to the destruction of the equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to start destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have around 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came as fighting raged on Thursday in the town of Safira which experts say houses a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. &#39;Man based in Britain.
The activist group, which tracks the human toll through a network of Syria-based activists, said on Thursday 120,296 people had died.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, an estimated 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad&#39;s armed forces were killed, of whom 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, an estimated 2,202 were also deserters and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated this figure since.
Some 2 million people have had to flee the country because of the conflict.
Assad&#39;s troops have been battling rebels, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda network groups, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said Thursday there were casualties on both sides, but gave no specifics.
The fighting underscored the serious dangers facing chemical weapons inspectors as they must complete their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal amid an enduring civil war, on time. tight.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, said its team was “now satisfied to have checked – and seen destroyed – all declared critical production and machinery for mixing and filling”.
She added that “no other inspection activity was planned at this time”.
Earlier in the week, inspectors said they had completed the first stage of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the latter two sites due to safety concerns, inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that the two sites were, according to Syria, &quot;abandoned and ... that the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected &quot;.
It was unclear at first glance whether Safira&#39;s unit was one of two sites that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons which was approved the following month by the Executive Committee of the OPCW.
&quot;I salute the moral strength and courage that you all have shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,&quot; said the organization&#39;s director general Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly pits Sunni Muslim rebels against al-Assad&#39;s government and its security forces, which are backed by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
Meanwhile, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there was a loud explosion on Wednesday at an air defense base in Syria&#39;s coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Two YMCA workers charged with sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two New South Wales YMCA workers have been charged with child molestation following allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 at a Commission hearing royal court on child sexual abuse.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said it “has never had to deal with a child sexual abuse issue within its organization.”
Chief Executive Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offenses and a YMCA Caringbah Hall physical education instructor was convicted of sexual assaults on children in the center where he worked in 1991.
Mr Hare told Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, that he had knowledge of the first case but was unaware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA&#39;s opening statement was inaccurate pointing out, &quot;External reviews of the YMCA have been carried out and have indicated that the safety of children is a top priority for the organization. »
It was shown before the Commission that the YMCA had been told it had received the second worst ratings out of four establishments in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit carried out in August this year.
Mr Hare, who started working at the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that people management had been a failure with Lord&#39;s recruitment and that he had failed to check that employees knew they were were required to report any violations of the Child Safety Policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexually assaulting twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of 6 years in prison.
But Mr Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA has a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord&#39;s failings in child safety.
Staff members testified that they observed certain failings, including Lord being alone with the children, keeping them private, sitting them on his lap, telling them he loved them and leaving them playing with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was mentored by Lord and had requested child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said she found YMCA Caringbah Children&#39;s Services Manager Jacqui Barnat, who mentored Lord &quot;very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time&quot;.
The chief executive said he rejected testimony from staff that they were reluctant to report such misconduct to their supervisor.
Instead, he said the friendly relationship they had with Lord clouded their judgment, so they didn&#39;t report his actions.
Mr Hare said he had expressed his views to the New South Wales YMCA board saying that for the organization the lesson learned from the &#39;Jonathan Lord incident&#39; should not be about &#39;the reporting” by staff, and the board agreed with him.
Mr Hare said the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations arose was made by YMCA chief executive for children&#39;s services, Liam Whitley.
He said the move was intended to avoid contamination of the evidence but was “overzealous” and poorly implemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a safe organization for children during the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, which was between 2009 and 2011, the child sexual abuse expert said, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
He said there were &quot;serious problems&quot; in recruiting, vetting, inducting, training and supervising staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
A ceremony in memory of the cremated deceased
The Père Lachaise crematorium is organizing a secular ceremony at 11 a.m. in memory of all the deceased cremated in its establishment during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, socialist candidate for mayor of Paris must attend, and will then explain, during a press conference, her funeral proposals.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funeral, more and more French people are choosing cremation rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study carried out on September 6 and 7 among 1,009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a loved one, it&#39;s the opposite: the French prefer burial (53% against 47%).
If they have the misfortune to lose a child, only 15% choose cremation.
In his book Death in Ashes, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Funeral Ethics Committee, insists on the &quot;violence&quot; that cremation constitutes for the survivors.
There is, with cremation, &quot;a violence done to the loved body&quot;, which will be &quot;reduced to a heap of ashes&quot; in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which &quot;would accompany the phases of mourning&quot; .
There is also &quot;a symbolic violence&quot;, which is due to the &quot;erasure of the singularity and the distinctive signs&quot; reduced to the &quot;anonymity&quot; of the ashes.
Why is what is easily accepted in some Nordic and Protestant countries, still badly experienced in France?
&quot;Because cremation is a new fact&quot;, answers Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Taming death.
It has only been tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to tame it.
Taming cremation means, for François Michaud-Nérard, Director General of Funeral Services of the City of Paris, planning for the deceased a ceremony as dignified as that to which he would be entitled with a burial.
The annual Ipsos survey shows a very strong attachment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their loved ones, whether religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of people who have chosen a cremation want a ceremony to be organised.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
&quot;For ten years, they have been trying to spare families the violence of waiting, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the handing over of the ashes&quot;, observes Mr. Michaud-Nérard.
70% of establishments now offer masters of ceremonies, who proceed, in the presence of the body, with the following ritual: welcoming the assembly, naming the deceased, connecting him to others, evoking him, giving meaning to his death, organizing the farewell.
This has been the case at the Père Lachaise crematorium since 1998.
The masters of ceremonies are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the Père Lachaise crematorium has been organizing, since 2010, on All Saints&#39; Day, several ceremonies of remembrance, secular and non-religious, to which it invites the families of people who have been cremated during the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is broadcast online, for those who cannot make the trip.
The crematorium allowed us to relay her.
Hagel blames 9 US states for violating gay rights
Since the federal state recognized same-sex marriage, &quot;all military spouses are entitled to a Department of Defense identification card and the benefits that come with it,&quot; the minister recalled in New York in a speech before the Anti-Defamation League fighting against anti-Semitism.
“But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in National Guard installations” located on their territory, he denounced, accusing these states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defense said he ordered the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The nine-state sling started with Texas refusing to implement these benefits on Texas National Guard settlements, due to a conflict between Texas law and federal same-sex marriage law.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population concerned by the recognition of homosexual marriage at around 5,600 active people, 17,000 including the National Guard, the reserve and retirees.
The price of oil continues to fall and is approaching $96 per barrel
The price of oil continued to slide on Friday as concerns over the size of inventories offset a report showing China&#39;s power-hungry manufacturing sector is gaining strength.
The price of benchmark U.S. crude for December delivery fell 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in late morning Europe during electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it down 5.8% for October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price over the past few weeks.
The US Department of Energy said Wednesday that US supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on China&#39;s manufacturing sector that arrived on Friday, which show growth in activity, suggest an uptick in demand.
This suggests that China&#39;s economic recovery may continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter from a two-decade decline in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude already used by US refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 a barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents her two new group choreographies at Danse Danse: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by Satie&#39;s famous Gymnopédies piano solos.
An evening that allows you to see the whole prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and from inky black to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, just as white, in the immense space that is the Théâtre Maisonneuve, advances, in profile, thin as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink by Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, simple line, takes its shape.
And this form will be that of the whole piece: a row of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, dressed entirely in black, only their hands and face uncovered, wait on each side of the playing area, rush when the next spelling appears, embody it, come out running.
This black and white game of Henri Michaux is done in relay of solos, in a group in unison (a mass that is solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
One thinks of &quot;Morning Glory&quot;, where, in solo, Chouinard carried out a series of choreographic tasks written on labels, posed in line at the front of the stage.
It&#39;s the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is loud, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the dance floor, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux&#39;s poem, monotonous and monotonous in the auction, and will continue dancing.
And the music to start again, and the sequence to resume.
This sonorous and energetic discharge, long if possible, ends up deafening and numbing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - creating images has always been a strength at Chouinard - like those hair that ruffles or those black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux&#39;s work, has imposed herself, with her tics.
Result: the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux&#39;s inks, like forms of Gestalt, open up a broader and more game-filled imagination than dance, which is more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers choppy by a strobe light and the white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches on magic.
The public liked it, the welcome was warm.
Les Gymnopédies, after the intermission, is richer.
The stage is partly draped in gray, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in an abandoned house.
On the piano, dancers take turns to play the scores.
Their musical clumsiness, touching, gives a real fragility.
On stage, pass the couples, in amorous duets, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving ensembles, choirs, the writing is less binary.
Jesters appear, also familiar to Chouinard, sporting red noses, in highly polarized male-female love parades.
Loves are carnivorous, fleeing or playful.
The gestures, the laughter and the little cries beautifully transpose the archaic, the grace and the ridiculousness of the bodies in coitus, of the beings who merge.
But the play really takes off after the salute.
A clown returns to the stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes possible: the fourth wall falls, the universes explored overlap, the dancers romp about, go down among the spectators, gossip, smoke, short-circuit each other, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a skilfully calculated disorder that remain sensual.
Joy and madness transpire, and it is Chouinard&#39;s art, there, to contaminate the public.
Major fire in a business
A fire seriously damaged a business in the borough of LaSalle, in Montreal, overnight from Thursday to Friday.
Help was called around 1 a.m. on Friday because of a fire that broke out in the basement of an Indian restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
The thirty firefighters who were dispatched to the scene took almost an hour to bring the blaze under control.
The fire &quot;caused significant damage to the structure of the building,&quot; said the chief of operations of the Montreal Fire Department, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when firefighters arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but nearly twenty apartments, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross has been requested as residents of one of the apartments may need to be housed temporarily, the SIM said.
Report: Obama campaign seen as ditching Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama&#39;s closest advisers have been secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to The New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant event featured in Mark Halperin and John Heilemann&#39;s long-awaited 2012 campaign book, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the president&#39;s close aides conducted &quot;extensive group work and polling in late 2011&quot; to see if ousting Biden might help Obama in his run. re-election as his hopes dwindled.
According to Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, namely former White House secretary Bill Daley, to gauge what effect replacing the vice president with former secretary of state Clinton could have on the ballot.
The possibility of a trade is a fiercely guarded secret within Chicago campaign headquarters and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president&#39;s top aides — including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina and former White House aides David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew the change was being considered.
&#39;Double Down&#39; says Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their &#39;close personal ties&#39;, before finally deciding against the change when numbers showed having Clinton on the presidential slate &#39;didn&#39;t markedly improve Obama&#39;s chances of success.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said I looked at a whole series of questions, and this was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
Remember at that time, the president was not in good shape, and so we were like, “Lord, what can we do? &quot;.
While Daley called the review &quot;concerted,&quot; Martin told CNN&#39;s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested heavily in finding out whether the change would be beneficial on the ballot.
&quot;Campaigns don&#39;t spend a lot of money on polls and focus groups unless they&#39;re seriously considering taking action,&quot; Martin told AC360.
However, it&#39;s unclear whether Obama was aware that his team was considering the replacement.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his then-boss knew about the possible reshuffle.
Although Daley said he didn&#39;t think the president &quot;knew&quot; about the possible change, the former secretary general admitted it was &quot;possible&quot; Obama knew.
Martin added that &quot;Double Down&quot; doesn&#39;t definitively answer the question of whether political polls have landed on Obama&#39;s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn&#39;t know Biden&#39;s ouster from the presidential slate was being considered.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
David Bowie: four unreleased songs to listen to
The English musician has not finished surprising this year.
From The Next Day, published in January, he concocted a luxury reissue scheduled for November 4, with several unpublished.
Four have already emerged on the Web.
The announcement of the release of a new David Bowie album left everyone speechless.
On his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he said a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, dates from 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that we could still count on him to make the pop scene sparkle.
A feast for his fans
Not tired of surprises, David Bowie had more than one trick up his sleeve with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke has planned to reissue this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he concocted a real feast for his fans.
This reissue, entitled The Next Day Extra, will come in the form of three discs: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already unveiled.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three tracks from the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie has also made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
He introduces both each of the discs, but also the accessories supplied with them: exclusive photos and covers, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with the lyrics...
And, above all, he gives a taste of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and a skilfully controlled rock electricity.
Unreleased tracks already listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.
The Informer is double-sided: a disturbing intro before a luminous cavalcade which gradually slows down to give way to a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a little reference to Elton John&#39;s Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The bewitching guitar riffs make you want to leave the Earth.
In any case, Bowie has fun playing the chameleon with these titles: in turn informant, man on board a rocket, Martian potential...
He conceals and reveals at the same time, playing at adopting different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, notably with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the photograph for the L&#39;Invitation au Voyage campaign for the Louis Vuitton brand, whose new face he embodies.
He will appear in one of their commercials, broadcast from November 10.
A bird hoisted from a platform in the North Sea has been released into the wild
A bird, airlifted after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea, has been released into the wild.
The water rail was flown on a helicopter to Aberdeen last month before it was rescued by the Scottish SPCA at its rescue center in Alloa.
The center&#39;s director, Colin Seddon, said: &quot;This water rail was probably a wintering migrant that came from northern Europe and got caught in the middle of high winds in the North Sea. »
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added: “He was unable to fly again so we were contacted to help. »
The water rail was healthy when released.
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers could well have access to applications like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the Netflix video-on-demand service via their television in the not-too-distant future.
The Cogeco subsidiary said Thursday that it was currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
“This will allow us to showcase more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options,” Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet explained in an interview.
Cogeco Cable is following in the footsteps of its competitors, such as Bell, even if the Cogeco subsidiary does not yet have a precise date for this new platform.
&quot;You have to adapt and change or resist change and fail,&quot; said Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
Telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been cited, can be ironed out.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in talks with some major cable companies to make its service available through their streaming platforms.
The CEO of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also hailed the announcement made by the Harper government in its Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the option of pay-per-view services.
“We have been saying for about two and a half years that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large channel packages does not work,” said Mr. Audet.
However, he hopes that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) will lead to interesting recommendations.
&quot;There should emerge from these discussions a kind of new frame of reference to define our new Canadian cultural policy with respect to television,&quot; said the CEO of Cogeco.
The CRTC has been consulting with the public since last week and they should continue with the industry next spring.
On the results side, Cogeco said it posted net income of $43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82¢ per share.
This is a decline from net earnings of 44.9 million, or 83¢ per share, for the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline by amortization costs related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired US-based cable company Atlantic Broadband in 2012 for $1.36 billion.
This was the company&#39;s first major acquisition after the failed one in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal company also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprises, a Vancouver-based Internet provider, for $526 million.
As for Cogeco&#39;s revenues, they grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.
Net income for its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90¢ per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93¢ per share, for the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable&#39;s revenues increased by 45% to reach 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers during the fourth quarter.
However, for the 2013 fiscal year, the number of Cogeco Cable customers is up 5546.
Mr. Audet is not worried to see the number of clients fluctuate in this way.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with very stiff competition.
Gazprom&#39;s Alexei Miller Says Bulgaria Gas Pipeline Ushers in New Era of Gas
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of Europe&#39;s biggest energy projects, the Gazprom director said.
&quot;An historic event took place today: Construction has started in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the most important large-scale project in Europe&quot;, explained Alexei Miller, the general director of Gazprom, in a statement Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify export routes from Russia to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine, the country through which most of the Russian gas destined for Europe passes, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, adds the director.
Miller added that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated “forever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced rate once the entire project is commissioned in 2015.
Gazprom said construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Unknowns fire on a hotel near the pyramids in Cairo
Unidentified hooded men opened fire on Friday at a hotel near the Cairo pyramids in Egypt without causing any casualties, the result of an apparent quarrel with dismissed employees.
The assailants fled, said interior ministry spokesman, police general Abdel Latif.
This attack comes as Egypt has hardly received any tourists since the army deposed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and bloodily suppressed protests by his supporters.
Schools encouraged to focus more on math, spelling and grammar
As part of the English literature course, students will study at least one Shakespeare play, one 19th century novel, one romantic poem and one work of contemporary British fiction from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also feature &#39;new texts&#39; to encourage more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be deleted.
From 2015, pupils will be required to take a stand-alone language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Department for Education is due to release its new English and maths syllabuses tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a drastic overhaul.
It will make changes to other core subjects next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Examination Regulator, will unveil a redesign of the structure of the GCSEs, with a new marking system and fewer courses.
Speaking over the summer, Michael Gove, Minister for Education, said there was &quot;broad consensus on the need to reform our examinations system to restore public confidence&quot;, insisting that GCSEs would be &quot;more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous&quot;.
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
By comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours a year, and Singapore students do about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal requirement to devote more hours of the timetable to maths, sources close to the Coalition Government have indicated that the in-depth maths GCSE – along with the greater importance given to subjects appearing in international rankings – would presumably encourage schools to provide more teaching hours.
The program will place greater emphasis on &quot;real world problems&quot;, including financial mathematics.
Are Europe&#39;s elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a promise to bring business together and define what wealth and job creators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the widest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they think of Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov interviewed over 1,000 business leaders, broadly representative of all company sizes, sectors and regions across Britain.
The findings of the investigation will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing while EU states stagnate.
They want to see the government prioritizing new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming Europe&#39;s institutional arcana.
When asked for their views on specific policy points – ranging from regulating monopolies to product laws – the majority of business leaders believe control of these key powers should return to Westminster.
The single market has caused widespread dissatisfaction, with businesses saying the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trading area – 40% of large businesses, traditionally the most pro -Europeans, even agree.
Finally, and most tellingly, our survey of business leaders revealed that a significant majority wanted to see Britain pursue initiatives for treaty change and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade and not politics.
This conclusion, which is found across all major corporations and businesses of all sizes, shows that the corporate world is pushing for “meaningful change” that puts power back in the UK.
The stakes are high – getting the treaty changed and better representing Britain&#39;s interests could see a 16% swing in votes in favor of keeping the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubts that this survey shows that British businesses support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain&#39;s membership of the EU.
It also shows that companies hope the renegotiation will be a significant shift in the current balance of power in favor of a return to UK hands.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of UK business as the Eurozone moves towards closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as our survey findings show, for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels. .
Beijing blames a Turkmen Islamic movement
&quot;Behind-the-scenes support for the bombing came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and West Asia,&quot; the head of China&#39;s security organs told a Hong Kong TV station, according to a video uploaded Thursday. evening on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CCP), was speaking in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
It is the first time that a Chinese official has named a particular organization after Monday&#39;s attack.
Chinese police say three Uyghurs from the same family from the Muslim-dominated region of Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, drove their car loaded with cans of gasoline into the entrance to the Forbidden City in Beijing. , in a suicide attack that left two dead and 40 injured.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother perished in the car fire.
Etim, which claims to fight for the independence of East Turkestan, the former name of Chinese Xinjiang, was classified by the UN in 2002 as an organization affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
This movement is often blamed by the Chinese authorities for the sporadic unrest in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after it got stuck 15m above the ground on an unstable ledge in a quarry
Ruby, a cocker spaniel, escaped after a minor road accident
She was spotted three days later by a dog walker who was stuck in the quarry
Firefighters abseiled down the cliff to retrieve the dog and save her from certain death
A pup was lucky to escape the worst after firefighters were called to retrieve him safely from his perch 15m above the ground on the unstable ledge of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker spaniel, escaped after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Her owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, traveled to Flappit Quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the Fire and Rescue Service of West Yorkshire.
They had been desperately searching for their lost dog and appealing on social media sites after she went missing in the quarry following a minor accident.
At around 2.15pm on Wednesday, a person with keen eyesight walking their dog spotted Ruby on a ledge in the quarry, stuck 15m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and abseiled to rescue Ruby using an animal stretcher to carry her up the cliff.
Technical rescue specialist Andy Clayton said: “She was in a precarious situation. »
She was right in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She didn&#39;t move at all during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she&#39;s fine now.
She ate cookies afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
It&#39;s amazing that anyone noticed the dog.
Technical rescue specialist Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very lucky to come out unscathed. »
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up; his general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said: “I was terrified watching the rescue. »
At first I didn&#39;t believe she was up there.
It was surprising to have her in my arms again.
The vet said that if she had been too exhausted and passed out, she probably would have fallen.
The firefighters were amazing.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each one of them has been absolutely wonderful.
Mr Alderson, of Keighley, added: “We were afraid she would fall but she didn&#39;t move. »
The firefighters were great.
I can&#39;t believe she was up there.
Ukraine nears bankruptcy
Credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s lowered Ukraine&#39;s credit rating on Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet republic, which has been in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The rating of the country&#39;s public debt securities goes to &quot;B-&quot;, sinking into the category of speculative investments.
It comes with a negative outlook, with S&amp;P seeing at least a one in three chance that it will be lowered again within a year.
“It is less and less likely that the government&#39;s strategy will guarantee enough foreign exchange to meet its high external financing needs,” explains the American agency.
The agency notes that Ukraine&#39;s foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects the trend to continue.
This complicates the repayment of credits taken abroad.
These reserves, which the authorities are using massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the agency considers more and more likely a devaluation, which would inflate its foreign debt.
kyiv also needs cash to pay for its gas imports from Russia, which accuses it of not having paid a bill of 882 million dollars.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian government in a period of intense tension with its Russian neighbor, furious at kyiv&#39;s desire to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country&#39;s economy had suffered between July and September its fifth consecutive quarter of contraction.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&amp;P estimates it at 33.5% of GDP, against less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in budget deficit, has been asking for help from the International Monetary Fund for months, which granted it a loan of 15.3 billion dollars in 2010 and has only released 3.4 billion so far.
But the Fund refuses to disburse any new tranche until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, in particular by increasing the price of gas to the population.
At the end of a new unsuccessful mission to the country, the IMF noted this week that &quot;the significant external financing needs&quot; constituted &quot;a vulnerability&quot;, while noting &quot;signs of economic improvement&quot;.
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud, of the Center for Political Studies, &quot;we cannot expect an improvement in the short term&quot;.
&quot;There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year&quot;, the presidential elections being scheduled for 2015, notes the expert, interviewed by AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation.
S&amp;P also notes the &quot;uncertainty&quot; linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditions on the release of opponent Yulia Tymoshenko.
“Signing the agreement would be positive for trade in the long term but there could be negative consequences in the short and medium term linked to the reaction of Russia”, explained S&amp;P, which fears “trade restrictions” on the part of Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukrainian exports, has warned that if a free trade zone is created between the EU and Kiev, it would have to tighten its border controls for imported goods.
Singapore&#39;s pawnbrokers cash in on middle classes forced to tighten their belts
At a pawn shop in Singapore&#39;s Bendemeer shopping mall, Janani Amirthalinga deposits a gold bracelet, ring and pair of earrings to pay for her daughters&#39; school fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it,” says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, such is demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – that ValueMax, where it carried out its transaction, this week became the third pawnbroker to be listed. on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Pawning jewelery is not only a quick way to get cash – Singapore $1,300 in Ms Amirthalinga&#39;s case – but it&#39;s almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Typically, pawnbrokers in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local moneylender with a branch in the same center. commercial.
However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary, and can clear loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnbrokers as families feel the pressure from rising living costs and household and consumer over-indebtedness.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fueled by overly loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnbrokers to make up the difference as their economies are slowing down.
This week, ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s cited rising household debt, stemming mainly from rising mortgage lending, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt-to-gross domestic product ratios in Asia.
Malaysia tops the list with 80% of GDP, up from 60% in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which narrowly emerged this week from a technical recession.
Data on Thursday showed continued weakness in exports and slowing consumer demand.
&quot;The bottom line is that with rising costs, people in the middle or bottom [of the pay scale] are looking to supplement their incomes however they can,&quot; says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past couple of years have seen people rush to pawn their belongings to get the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, around 70% of the items pawned in the city-state&#39;s 200 pawnshops are gold.
People say, &quot;the price of gold is high, let&#39;s pawn grandma&#39;s gold chain and we&#39;ll come back for it next month.&quot;
In Thailand, the largest pawn shop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its shops in recent months.
The rise is such in the pawnshop sector that ValueMax, operator of the shop in Bendemeer and 15 other shops like it in Singapore, plans to expand not only into neighboring Malaysia – where it already has four shops – but also outside of Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its managing director.
The company will fund them using 60% of the Singapore $66m it raised this week in its Singapore IPO.
While some cut-rate lenders have come under fire for charging exorbitant interest rates, Ms. Yeah says pledging not only offers lower rates than other lenders, it also doesn&#39;t does not directly increase the debt.
&quot;Customers are mortgaging things they already own, and monetizing their personal assets doesn&#39;t increase household debt,&quot; she says.
Pledging is becoming more and more socially accepted as a means of obtaining secured short-term financing.
People who go to pawnshops aren&#39;t just those in financial trouble, either.
Affluent people in Singapore also go to ValueMax pawnshops to pawn gold bars or Rolex watches, which can amount to up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all walks of life.
“It can be well-to-do people who need short-term borrowing for business activities or investments, or small businesses who need cash to get through a difficult period,” adds Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money really fast.
The cocaine-addicted lawyer who tipped off a drug kingpin about a police investigation has been jailed
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction would come to light
He was sentenced to a three-year prison term by Liverpool Assize Court
A top defense attorney, who tipped off a drug kingpin about a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction would come to light, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was giving sensitive information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough regarding investigations into his drug-dealing activities after he compromised himself because of his habit of cocaine use.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed &#39;Bash&#39; and considered by criminals to be a &#39;key case&#39;, was arrested at his home in 2011 following wiretapping operations by police directed at Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous trial in relation to drug trafficking.
Police officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping off three bags of cocaine at the barrister&#39;s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while attending a bar dinner with colleagues.
Investigations revealed Ditta was a &quot;regular user&quot; of the Class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought to illicitly obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough as well as one of his associates.
The four suspects were being watched by police at the time as part of a major heroin and cocaine trafficking investigation taking place in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Along with 32 other men, they were subsequently jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5m, as well as over £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was providing information to criminals because he feared his drug addiction would come to light.
At Liverpool Assize Court today, Ditta, who works at Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, fell out of favor after being found guilty on two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The barrister&#39;s downfall came after police, investigating Scarborough, discovered he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta&#39;s home and placing drugs, 60% pure, under the attorney&#39;s trash cans in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the filing, Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner party at Ewood Park football stadium, home of Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer returned home, found the drugs, and they called each other nine times.
The court heard Ditta was a &quot;regular user&quot; of cocaine after tests showed traces of the Class A drug in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine. He said he spoke to the alleged drug dealer because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to &quot;legal privilege&quot;.
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his wallet and attempted to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
During questioning, he stated that he had an office at his home, as well as at his place of work, and that clients sometimes called him at his home with legal questions.
But the court heard testimony that he called major players in the drug trade, including some he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators knew about it.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “If anyone should know not to break the law, it&#39;s a criminal lawyer. »
Mr. Ditta is accused of having abused his position as a criminal lawyer, and of having become too involved with particular clients.
The relationship we&#39;re talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will no doubt be legitimate communications because he was his attorney.
But it went far beyond the ordinary bounds of a lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored it.
He got too close to some clients, particularly Scarborough, and let his independence be compromised.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and said: &quot;If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr Scarborough, I would not have waited 3 p.m., I would have done so immediately. »
But after the hearing Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said: &#39;Mr Ditta went from criminal barrister to criminal himself when he started sourcing drugs from organizations criminals. »
His addiction to cocaine compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the ulterior motives of leading members of organized crime groups who tasked him with obtaining valuable information regarding police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and establish a climate of trust with the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the veneer of his profession.
Lancashire&#39;s Serious and Organized Crime Unit led the investigation into Mr Ditta, who was found guilty on all three counts of possession of cocaine and now obstruction of justice, testifying to his commitment to prosecute criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is above the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to aiding and abetting trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in the traffic were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his site, Ditta hosted a Q&amp;A about himself in which he said his dream job would be to be a lawyer representing clients on death row in America, his latest guest at dinner would be Muhammad Ali and inequality would be what motivates him to work.
Renault weighed down on the stock market by Nissan&#39;s warning
Renault suffered the biggest drop in the SBF 120 index in Paris on Friday after its partner Nissan Motor announced that it had cut its annual net profit forecast by nearly 20%, traders report.
Nissan, which had to carry out such an overhaul, also announced a management reshuffle.
Several traders reported that the Renault share was affected this morning by the &quot;warning&quot;.
&quot;It&#39;s clearly Nissan&#39;s profit warning,&quot; said a trading manager at a Parisian brokerage.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of the capital of Nissan and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of the French, according to data from the Nissan website.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, official says
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening, a military official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out airstrikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 was engulfed in flames in Old Quebec Friday noon.
The four-unit building, located at 15 rue Hébert, received three alarms from the fire department.
The fire broke out at the front, but spread to all three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Quebec Fire Department, said that the rapid intervention of firefighters prevented the flames from spreading to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this sector of the city where buildings are built close together.
The burned house contained four apartments, but no tenants were on the premises at the time of the fire.
The damage was on the whole limited, even if the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine the origin, but the sappers have dismissed the thesis of a criminal act.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists from the Laval Health and Social Services Center (CSSS) caused quite a stir for the management of the Cité-de-la-Santé Hospital in 2012. -2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leaves or simply departures, the pharmacy department found itself severely understaffed.
Nearly 30% of the necessary staff was missing, making this financial year &quot;very difficult&quot;, according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire independent labour, which can cost up to three times more than a full-time pharmacist.
We did not resort to troubleshooting, explained Ms. Beaudet.
We have rationalized or reduced some of our activities inside the establishment to compensate for the time that things recover.
Of course, we have worked hard to interest our young people [pharmacy residents] so that they come and stay here.
There was a combination of circumstances that meant that we were in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this arduous period, the year 2013-2014 promises to be much easier for the CSSS pharmacy department.
Already, three pharmacists are back at work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the efforts made by the department to retain them have borne fruit, since the four students currently in residence in Laval have also decided to remain employed by the CSSS.
Now it&#39;s much better, said the pharmacist.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three returning from maternity.
This will therefore make up for our departures from last year.
Ever-increasing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or the predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have a young environment and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always go through three maternity leaves when things are going well, a- she added.
Last year, we had a lot more and we don&#39;t have pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.

Anger sparked by sentencing of Bali bomber
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombings have reacted angrily to the sentencing of the latest conspirator to be brought to justice, saying Umar Patek should be shot by firing squad. &#39;execution.
Patek, who has spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia&#39;s most wanted men, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in manufacturing the explosive devices used during the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old was convicted of mass murder in the bombings targeting two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of numerous other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bombings targeting churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have asked for a life sentence, yet they could have asked that the man, referred to as the &quot;Demolition Man&quot; for his reputation as an expert bomb-maker, be sentenced to death.
The decision brought back painful memories for June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction carried out by Patek and the other conspirators almost 10 years ago.
On the verge of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
“He should be dragged before the firing squad,” Ms Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren, or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded into a van parked outside, exploded just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy&#39;s Bar when a suicide bomber blew up an explosive-laden backpack there just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he “died” three times while on life support.
Mr Hughes said Patek should have met the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terror cell responsible for the carnage - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed 4 years ago.
In reality, this man should have been condemned to death before the others.
Keep him alive, why, there&#39;s no reason to keep him alive.
Spending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds more is not much.
Patek is the latest of the Bali bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid capture for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to reestablish links between Southeast Asian terror groups and al-Qaeda. .
&quot;He didn&#39;t surrender,&quot; Ms Corteen added.
Until recently, he couldn&#39;t care less about the grief he may have caused other people.
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks which will be celebrated later this year and marked with ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
&quot;There will be a lot of crying this year,&quot; said Ms. Corteen.
Patek can, however, appeal against his conviction.
Tony Blair has said he would seize the opportunity to become prime minister again, but acknowledges his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old offered his views on various national policies.
Since stepping down in June 2007 after a decade in charge, Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet&#39;s special envoy for the peace process in the UK. Middle East.
When asked if he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr Blair reportedly replied, according to the Evening Standard in London: &quot;Yes, of course, but it is unlikely that it will happen, so...&quot;
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a strike by an American drone on Friday in Pakistan, security services have learned.
Hakimullah Mehsud&#39;s death has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence, military and activist officials said this time he had lost his life in the strike, carried out in the North Waziristan region.
&quot;We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone strike,&quot; a senior security official said.
The day before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, traveling to London, had informed the British government that discussions had been initiated with the Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Imbroglio around the closure of the emergency room of the Hôtel-Dieu
Faced with the rebellion led for several months by part of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on July 10 to &quot;shift the timetable for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of emergencies which cannot intervene on November 4&quot;.
A request officially made &quot;to run no risk on the management of emergencies in Paris at the start of winter&quot; but which also aimed not to interfere with the PS campaign a few months before the municipal elections.
Despite the ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective on this date.
Even if, at the APHP, we prefer to use the term &quot;transformation&quot; or &quot;change in continuity&quot;.
From November 4, the firefighters – who provided around a quarter of the 40,000 annual visits to the Hôtel-Dieu emergency room – will all have been instructed to take the thirty serious cases a day to the emergency rooms of other hospitals. Parisians.
This date of November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the Hôtel-Dieu, interns specializing in emergencies will give way on Monday to five interns in general medicine.
As for the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for later this month.
&quot;The emergency reception service at the Hôtel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us, it&#39;s November 4&quot;, assures bluntly Loïc Capron, the president of the establishment&#39;s medical commission ( CME) of the APHP, which supports the management project.
“On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by the firefighters, only people coming by their own means,” confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical manager of the new Hôtel-Dieu.
“But we will continue to receive emergency patients,” he tempers, pointing to the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain on site, he also assures.
But it is up to the ARS to decide on the closure of the emergency reception service.
“Things are being done gradually,” replies Nicolas Péju, spokesman for the ARS for whom, on November 4, “there will be no change in terms of service rendered.”
&quot;The minister lied to us or we lied to her,&quot; laments emergency doctor Gérald Kierzek.
Dismissed from his position as head of the SMUR in early July for having led the revolt against the reorganization project, he defines himself as a &quot;whistleblower&quot; in the face of a &quot;cynical&quot; decision taken by &quot;the medico-administrative technostructure&quot;.
&quot;They are emptying and asphyxiating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago,&quot; he said.
For him, &quot;if the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem&quot;.
But they are regularly clogged.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting in the emergency room of Lariboisière.
At the ARS, it is argued that thirty patients &quot;dispatched&quot; to several sites are not likely to represent an &quot;avalanche&quot; in the other emergency services, whose human resources will also have been reinforced.
At the ARS as at the APHP, we defend the &quot;new hospital model&quot; already started since October 7 and which should continue to welcome 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners should also come to participate in the establishment of a &quot;permanence of ambulatory care&quot;.
&quot;Where are we going if we ask people to self-diagnose&quot;, wonders Gérald Kierzek for whom &quot;the concept of not serious emergency&quot; is &quot;dangerous&quot; and marks a &quot;medical regression&quot;.
This will happen as for level 3 maternities.
People are not crazy, they will go where there is the best healthcare available.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change gear, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency doctor and member of CGT Santé.
We are going to be even more present in the municipal campaign and we are going to think about presenting a list.
In Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet&#39;s team, Vincent Roger, Paris UMP adviser and elected representative of the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that &quot;even if the Parisian UMP were for the maintenance of emergencies at the Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to the responsibilities&quot;.
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, again recalled Monday morning on France Inter that she had spoken out in favor of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on November 4.
If this were the case, she would mark her clear disagreement, underlines Bruno Julliard, her spokesperson.
Even if the restructuring of the Hôtel-Dieu has its legitimacy on the merits, we cannot accept it without an acceptable scheme of transfer to other hospitals.
Did you think travel agencies were a thing of the past because of the internet?
Flight Center seems to be reversing the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecast upwards and is hoping for record results thanks to holidaymakers from Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency now expects full-year underlying profit of between $325 million and $340 million before tax, compared with a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12 to 17% growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million achieved in 2011/12.
Chief Executive Graham Turner said Flight Center made 8% profit in the first half and the second half got off to a strong start, particularly in non-business travel to Australia and the United States. United Kingdom.
“Year-to-date, all 10 countries in which we operate have been profitable, and several of them are on track to achieve record full-year results before interest and taxes” , did he declare.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the highest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded in the second half, helping to offset a slightly weaker domestic business travel market.
Similarly in the UK, Flight Centre&#39;s leisure travel business performed well while business customers spent less.
Its subsidiary in the United States recouped its losses in the first half of the year when seasonal demand is weaker and was expected to report a profit for the full year for the third consecutive time.
Flight Center shares rose 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
GM is recalling some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the seat backs
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups for fixing an issue with manually reclining seatbacks, according to a statement Friday from the U.S. vehicle safety regulator.
On certain pickups, the front seats could have a fault with the reclining mechanism.
As a result, the backrests do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
“If the vehicle is struck from behind, the head restraint may not adequately protect passengers, increasing the risk of injury,” according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website ( NHTSA).
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The rollout of GM&#39;s pickups began in June and represents the largest vehicle launch for the top U.S. automaker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM notified pickup owners of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the owner information letter due to the 16-day shutdown of government operations, which slowed vehicle sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, rose about 20% in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM&#39;s stock price rose 1.4% to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.

Toronto mayor chases reporters who came to question him on drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of taking drugs, according to several media.
A video submitted to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The person concerned, Rob Ford, has always denied having used crack, while admitting to having a penchant for cannabis.
This Thursday, he chased several journalists from his property who came to question him.
We also believe that sometimes images don&#39;t need any explanation or commentary.
Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new Catholic Church cardinals for the first time on Feb. 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
Cardinals are the most senior clergymen in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, once a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – this amounts to a group of 120 “Cardinal Electors”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting of all existing cardinals would be held ahead of the ceremony in which bishops will be elevated to the dignity of cardinal, known under the name of consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February the number of cardinal voters will likely have dropped.
He said a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as needed to bring the number of cardinal electors up to 120 and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wanted.
Next year&#39;s consistory will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a kind of tendency to favor Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance,” he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with considering ways to reform the church.
Previously, the pope decided alone.
“Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero explained.
He added that it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is completely new.
Valero said popes typically elevate bishops representing large communities to the rank of cardinal, but Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he will appoint.”
The tenants must go to vote, because each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of housing, which goes in taxes to the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each dwelling.
We are forced to increase the rents to help us pay the new taxes.
By going to vote, we are sending a clear message.
We need to change things in the City.
All the candidates told us they would tackle the outrageous debt.
We can no longer afford $100,000 fireworks, $4-5 million land just in case...
Go vote, it&#39;s the best way to express yourself and say that enough is enough.
Vettel shows off a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The lucky winner, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat at track level.
German Sebastian Vettel, four-time Formula 1 world champion, released for free practice at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday a special helmet designed by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel chose from 1,500 drawings sent from around the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, an automobile brand, of his team.
He was invited to follow the GP of Abu Dhabi, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion up close, on the track and in his pit.
Vettel had to wear this helmet Friday and Saturday, at the tests.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, intended to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper &quot;East Hampton Star&quot; to residents of the town of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
&quot;He died Sunday morning, gazing up at the trees and performing the famous 21st movement of tai chi, with his musician&#39;s hands slicing through the air,&quot; writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a tai chi master, a Chinese martial art.
The singer&#39;s wife also explains that she had promised her husband, the week before his death, to get him out of the hospital and take him to their house in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here over the past few years.
And even though we are city dwellers, this is our spiritual home.
&quot;Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and the beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joie de vivre he had,&quot; she adds.
Lou Reed had undergone a liver transplant last May.
She tries to import 2 kg of cocaine in pumpkins
Taking advantage of Halloween, a woman tried to smuggle two kilos of cocaine hidden in pumpkins into the country on Thursday morning at Montreal-Trudeau airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger&#39;s luggage that the drugs were detected.
The cocaine had been distributed in three pumpkins having been previously emptied.
The drugs were then transported to the office of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) which took over in this investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) has not revealed where the woman was coming from when she was intercepted.
It&#39;s part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, spokesperson for the CBSA.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montréal-Trudeau airport have made 173 drug seizures, including 10 seizures of cocaine for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region made a total of 1,653 narcotics seizures.
Gérard de Villiers, the author of &quot;SAS&quot;, is dead.
He will never have known the word retirement.
Phenomenon of French publishing, Gérard de Villiers, who died Thursday at the age of 83, had just published his 200th SAS, &quot;La Vengeance du Kremlin&quot;.
In February, the New York Times named him &quot;the author of spy novels who knew too much&quot;.
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the scene of the 198th and 199th installments of the famous series of spy novels.
Physically diminished by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he moved during this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he had also gone back to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, claimed to be unaware of the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of &quot;SAS in Istanbul&quot;, the first of the series, nearly a year ago. &#39;a half-century.
&quot;Probably between 120 and 150 million all countries combined,&quot; he said last March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment in a building on Avenue Foch a stone&#39;s throw from the Arc de Triomphe, his mischievous eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS have been translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
&quot;Not to mention the pirate editions,&quot; he added, pointing to a pile of books on the coffee table between the bronzes or ivories brought back from the 130 countries surveyed to place his novels there.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with advantageous breasts, carrying a pistol or an assault rifle.
Inside, His Serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, penniless Austrian aristocrat and contract agent for the CIA to pay for repairs to the family castle, sets off on the heels of all the bad guys on earth, communists of the 70s and 80, then jihadists from the 90s.
Each book has the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, a few hard sex scenes, a touch of violence and torture.
&quot;I never claimed to be a literary author&quot;, explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to entertain people I don&#39;t send a message to.
He worked &quot;like the great pre-war reporters, of the Albert London type, who went on the spot and came back with real and long investigations&quot;.
SAS&#39;s father said &quot;to make a kind of geopolitical soap opera&quot;.
&quot;I constantly follow my files (Afghanistan, Syria, etc.) before leaving,&quot; added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those of the AFP, diplomats, people of the services that I know for some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often prescient: thus, a month before the attack on a Syrian regime command center that killed several senior officials, he told the story in &quot;Le Chemin de Damas&quot;.
In &quot;Les Fous de Benghazi&quot;, he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadat in &quot;The Cairo Plot&quot;, a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in &quot;Panic in Bamako&quot;, he recounted the columns of 4X4 jihadists who descended on the Malian capital.
I am not a diviner, Gérard de Villiers defended himself, I simply make assumptions from countries that I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled down for a month behind his IBM daisy typewriter dating from 1976 &quot;all the parts of which have been changed&quot;.
300 pages later, he wrote the word &quot;END&quot; and corrected each page in pen.
On the walls of his office hang AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly pinned for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sex objects in my books, but others are beautiful, smart, and brave women.
I am always well received in Africa where I have many readers.
Gérard de Villiers had said it: &quot;Malko Linge, like all heroes, is ageless&quot;.
He will not die and will not retire.
Not more than me.
Nearly 50,000 homes are without power across the province shortly after noon on Friday due to high winds affecting many areas along the St. Lawrence River.
The sectors most affected are the Laurentians with 15,042 subscribers plunged into darkness, the Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8,642.
The greater Montreal area is also experiencing its share of blackouts with nearly 7,000 homes without power in the metropolis and Laval.
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lights
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometers of seaside covered in a cloak of light: you could almost feel the heat in Menton with the bill for the illuminations.
Invoice which, unlike many municipalities, is also paid by taxpayers, and not by trade associations.
To reduce its costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also differentiated management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Beijing blames Uyghur group for Tiananmen attack
China&#39;s domestic security chief on Friday accused a group of Uyghur separatists from Xinjiang of being behind the car bombing that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, drove into the crowd in the famous square of the Chinese capital, symbol of the murderous repression carried out in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passers-by.
Meng Jianzhu, member of the Political Bureau in charge of internal security issues, accused the East Turkestan Islamic Movement of being the instigator of the attack.
Many Uyghurs, a Turkish-speaking minority living in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent outbreaks of violence that occur there, driven by demands for independence.
&quot;The violent terrorist incident that took place in Beijing was organized and premeditated,&quot; Meng told Hong Kong&#39;s Phoenix TV.
&quot;The group that stood behind the scenes was the Islamic Movement of Eastern Turkestan,&quot; he added, his remarks being echoed by the New China agency.
Chinese police have identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests he is of Uyghur origin and said his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers filled with gasoline and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident left 42 injured.
The East Turkestan Islamic Movement is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Repainted lights: a deputy calls for the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
Minister Brigitte Grouwels&#39; project to &quot;relift&quot; traffic light posts in Brussels does not please everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday in the center of Brussels a test project consisting of repainting 16 traffic light poles in the region in the yellow and blue colors of Brussels.
The aim being both &quot;to increase security&quot; and &quot;the Brussels identity&quot;.
The idea is to eventually repaint all traffic lights in Brussels, at an estimated cost of around one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is &quot;too dark&quot;, according to the Brussels deputy Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of &quot;Flemishization&quot; of the capital and demands the &quot;resignation&quot; of Brigitte Grouwels.
&quot;Not content with spending madly the money of the people of Brussels in operations to relift the sign posts in the colors of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues her operations to flemish the capital&quot;, protests Mr. De Bock in a press release.
After her yellow-mango-black taxis, she finally repainted the Brussels posts herself in yellow-dark blue-black.
According to the MP, there is now &quot;no longer any difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels&quot;.
The people of Brussels deserve better than to see their money wasted by a CD&amp;V minister who is carrying out the NVA&#39;s program herself.
It is high time to stop the Trojan Horse of Flanders.
&quot;As a reminder, Brigitte Grouwels was only elected with 2,245 votes, or 0.5% of the people of Brussels!&quot;, concludes Mr De Bock.
The Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier in &quot;unavailability&quot;
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is stranded.
The leak of radioactive steam detected on one of the two nuclear boiler rooms of the Charles-de-Gaulle, in mid-October and while the boat was at sea, was &quot;safe for sailors&quot;, but is not without consequence for the Navy.
The Royal has indeed just confirmed to us &quot;the unavailability&quot; of the ship until &quot;mid-November&quot;, &quot;the time to take the necessary corrective measures&quot; on the reactor.
For its part, the DCNS company, a specialist in naval defense, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, dispatched to the Var for the occasion, &quot;are currently working on the aircraft carrier&quot;.
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the faulty boiler room.
&quot;Everything is done so that the Charles-de-Gaulle can make its deployment planned for the end of 2013&quot;, however explains DCNS.
And the Navy to certify that &quot;it does not in any way call into question the activity program of the boat&quot; with nuclear propulsion.
Remember that the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier is coming out of a six-month intermediate maintenance period.
He had sailed from Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, with a view to qualifying young fighter pilots.
A &quot;minor damage&quot;, limited to the containment space of the reactor, then occurred on the flagship of the French fleet.
According to the French Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination.
He goes to the supermarket in Nazi uniform, before being chased away
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform crossed out with a swastika armband was asked to leave an English supermarket after customers complained to management who called the police, the store said Friday.
“We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store,” said a spokeswoman for the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police for help, but &quot;by the time she arrived he was already gone without a fuss,&quot; she added.
I was queuing when I saw a woman who looked upset.
People were speechless.
&quot;You don&#39;t go out like this on the street unless you want to attract attention,&quot; customer Rosina Rusin, 60, told Cambridge News.
This incident happened on Thursday, the holiday of Halloween, where it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was unclear if it was a hoax.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for the act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
&quot;I have worn a black SS armband twice a week for three years at Asda,&quot; said Paul Dutton, explaining that he suffers from &quot;mental problems&quot;.
