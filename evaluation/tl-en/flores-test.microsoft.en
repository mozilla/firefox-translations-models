Not only does it confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already prevalent, but it also provides details that fossils usually don't, such as color and arrangement in three dimensions.
Scientists say the animal's fur is chestnut brown on the top with a pale or carotenoid color on the underside.
The discovery also provided insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have great stems, called rachis, but there were other feather features "barbs and barbule" the researchers thought that rachis were likely a newer product of evolution than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that even though it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the example shows that it was the feathers of an old dinosaur and not an inner, thin feather of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, even though it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample showed adult feathers and not chick feathers.
A car bomb detonated at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killed two policemen and injured more than twenty other people.

Much of the work done was theoretical, but the program was written to encourage observations made about the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team is looking at will be caused by the massive force between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls the earth in, causing the ocean water to rise and shrink, so does the Milky Way exert force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have also come to the conclusion that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter affects the same thing.
According to this theory, a large part of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a kind of limbo, and is made up of a myriad of tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in KwaZulu-Natal, a region located in South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new variant was "extremely troubling and alarming because of the high percentage of deaths."
Dr. Moll thinks some patients may have contracted the bacteria in the hospital, and at least two were health care workers at the hospital.
In a given year, an infected person can infect anywhere from 10 to 15 people who have been in close contact.

In France, voting has become accustomed to being a low-tech experience: voters separate themselves in a booth, placing a pre-printed piece of paper stating their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the identity of the person who voted, the person who voted would drop the envelope into the ballot box and sign off on the list of eligible voters.
French electoral law relatively strictly codifies processes.
Beginning in 1988, ballot boxes must be clear so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of the polls and so that no additional envelopes can be added except for those duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. At night, votes are counted by volunteers under intense supervision, following specific processes.

Her other race, the Giant Slalom, saw her finish tenth in the women's sitting group with a combined running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than Austrian first-place winner Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth-place winner GyÃ¶ngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers in the seated women's group failed to finish their races, and 45 of the 117 skiers failed to finish in the Giant Slalom race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Aray said, "We have arrested five people who raped a Swedish woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop".
The accused have been named as Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Superintendent of police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused had appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The street where the collision occurred was temporarily closed as members of the emergency team pulled the driver out of his red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to hospital at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred again to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been at Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of his son.
He is being held in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony may have been tampered with because his picture was widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but the Scottish judiciary operates differently and it has become the view of the courts that the publication of photographs has the potential to be discriminatory.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that "mobsters seem to be walking on the brink of doom when publishing photos etc of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the entirety of all proceedings, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
The document, as revealed, refers to the dispute over the boundary issue, in which the Palestinians wanted it based on the pre-1967 Middle East War.
Other topics are estimated to include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred both to the nations and to the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands the retention of a military presence in the valley for ten years when an agreement is signed while the PA agrees to maintaining such a presence for only five years.
Shooters in the supplemental pest control test will be carefully supervised by rangers, as the test is monitored and its effectiveness is evaluated.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Association of Sport Shooters of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been recruited, under the hunting programme of the Association of Sport Shooters.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the NPWS's Interim Director of Conservation and Park Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by the new nine-member Provisional Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the CEP as part of preparations to bring the country into new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-administration protests that began in October.
Protests that were once violent were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which were supposed to be as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of the defective iPod have been reported, causing six fires in total and leaving four people with slight burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 device-related accidents.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly disappointing."
The Mariana earthquake occurred at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas office for emergency management said no injuries had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman kidnapped Hong Kong tourists by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and adults, were released early, as were Filipino photographers.
Photographers later replaced an elderly woman because she needed to use a toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed his father's example and worked in the medical field.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating early birth defects in her spare time.
Research has shown that when a hormone is given, it accelerates the maturation of the baby's lungs in the womb.
Xinhua reported that government investigators had recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Others like him also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. He was my first manager. Luna passed away two months later. He was just as unique as he was. She is a brave woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels declares that "Luna is just as weird as I am... Perhaps more... I love him and I'm so excited for him... I hope he's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people questioned in the survey ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia's republic having grown by 8 per cent since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 per cent of those surveyed hold this view, seeking Queen Elizabeth II to become Australia's last queen.
At both ends of the survey, 29 per cent of those questioned believed Australia should be a republic soon, while 31 per cent believed Australia should never be a republic.
The Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer was set to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his injuries have put his fitness in question.
He couldn't take the drugs needed to relieve the pain he was feeling because they were banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known primary number to date on Jan. 25.
Some people confirmed the discovery using a variety of hardware and software in early February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water transport to the earth along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists want to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his tenure as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the allegations "political stunts and nonsense."
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to previous ground-based radar-based technology so that air traffic controllers can identify aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being put in place and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities will not be available on site.
Fears over a lack of transport have raised the prospect of being forced to play the match behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the development of a new bird species in the Ecuadorean Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species underwent evolution in just two generations, although this process is believed to have lasted much longer, due to the breeding between a native Darwinian finch, Geospiza fortes,  and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be molded into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled into thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. They can be hammered or rolled into piles.
It can be made very thin, and glued to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was once used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice varies in color according to how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the analyzed chemical.
Hydrogen atoms consist of only one proton separate from its electron, and a separate hydrogen ion is commonly called a proton.
Mix the two dry powders together in a circular manner and then, using clean wet hands, squeeze them into a ball shape.
The moisture on your hands will react with the external suckers, which will make it feel weird and form a skin-like texture.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro at the time had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remnants of sewer systems have been found in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There are also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women lived together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The space satellite will receive the call and send it back down almost instantly.
The satellite in space is sent by rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because Earth's atmosphere causes some of our light to be distorted and visible.
It takes a large rocket 100 feet tall to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The world has changed the world in extraordinary ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is that it has given us easier and faster transportation.
It has provided us with the railroad, the car, and many other means of transportation.
They were followed by a number of cats of about the size of an animal that ranged in size from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including stray cats) eat more and more small prey such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is to have a corresponding task or a special task to avoid competition from each cat.
Lions are the friendliest cats, living in large groups called prides.
The prides consist of one to three interlocking old males, as well as up to thirty females and a young lion.
Women are often closely related to each other, as a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that resemble lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also extremely aggressive towards their prey.
An all-around athlete, a tiger can climb (though not quite as well), swim, jump long distances and pull five times the strength of a strong man.
Tigers belong to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones capable of screaming.
The roar of a tiger is not like the roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of screaming, screaming words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They would catch monkeys, snakes, rats and birds if they could. Almost all of the animals that the ocelot looks for are much smaller than this.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and search for animals to eat (prey) by sniffing, sniffing where they are on the ground.
They can see clearly in the dark with night vision, and can also act stealthily. Ocelots catch their prey by adapting to their environment and then prey on prey.
If a small group of living things (a small population) are isolated from the main population they came from (such as if they were going to a mountain or a river, or if they were moving to a new island so they wouldn't be able to return easily), they often find themselves in a place that is different from where they came from.
This new environment will have different resources and different competitors, so the new population will require different traits or adaptations to become strong competitors than they previously needed.
The original population hasn't changed anything, they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to change their appearance differently than that of another population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will become so different in appearance that they cannot be classified as the same species.
We call this process specialization, which simply means the formation of new species. Specialization is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen which is what humans breathe, and they take in the carbon-dioxide that humans emit (that is, breathe it out).
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes out of plants and make clothes out of plants. Almost all of the food we eat is plant-based. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaurus was the leading predator of its time, so it had nothing to fear, except for other mosasaurus.
Its long jaws have 70 sharp teeth, including a spare row above its mouth, meaning no one can escape who comes across it.
We can't be sure, but it may have had a tongue-in-cheek twist. Its diet includes turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex wouldn't be able to dominate it.
Although much of their food is familiar to us, the Romans also had their spectacular or extraordinary foods prepared at the feast, including pig grass, peanuts, snails, and a class of rat called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and the woman eat sitting in chairs, the rich man likes to have feasts together where they can sit on their backs while eating.
Ancient Roman foods may not have had the foods that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey at all.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a main temple which was known as the house of the gods.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and priests would try to take care of the gods' needs through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower is a unique sanctuary for the gods.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house didn't matter much.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outside.
The women cook in the yard; The shops are just open dispatches facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the cost of wood was very high.
There are very few people living in Greenland. In long Norse accounts, they say that Red Erik was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling farther west, he saw Greenland and named it Greenland.
But whatever he discovered, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might imagine that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text is at the bottom of the document, which is upside down.
Although no one can be sure of its authorship, it is known that early in its life, the large parchment document (it measures 29′3/4 inches by 24′1/2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
It may be, therefore, that the brief note was placed to serve as a mere mark.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent wars liberated Northern France, but its south was still not free.
It was under the control of the French "Vichy". These were people from France who had made a treaty with the Germans in 1940 and had been complicit with the invaders rather than their enemies.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was dubbed "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a very large group of people who live and breathe, a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and it also somehow indicates the size of society.
Nation-states are the beginning of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a perpetual cultural footprint and equitable dissemination.
Secondary cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as worthy civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—Congress as its distinct part—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress has no power whatsoever to levy taxes, and, having no national executive or judiciary, it is dependent upon state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
Nor does it have the power to repeal interstate tax laws and tariffs.
The Articles require general assent from all the states before they can be amended and the states do not take the central government seriously and therefore often do not have their representatives.
The Italian national football team, as well as the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and became the hosts of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, basketball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan holds nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to Japan's group of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "island" because of its geographical location.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century when passing European sailors named the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in indigenous grain production practices and providing employment to Chinese workers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Pichu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
In the year 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu was restored and the renovation continues to this day.
For example, the most common format of photography in the world for still images is 35 mm, which became the primary film size at the end of the analog film era.
It's still being done today, but what's even more important is that digital camera image sensor formats have inherited their aspect ratio.
The 35 mm format is in fact, it seems confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divide by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (APS family of formats, for example) are approximately or equal to this aspect ratio.
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of the thirds is a simple guide that creates excitement while maintaining a level of order in a picture.
This states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the confluence of the lines that divide the image into three vertical and horizontal (see example).
At this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has bound European states together despite differences in language and customs.
Its pervasive-all-pervading power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the core Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and church funds are there for that particular purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years and it is this concentration of power and money that has led many to question whether this principle is being met.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital supplies for the military and civilians, although this barricade violated the generally accepted international law set out as a system through several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire ocean, causing danger even to neutral ships.
With only a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing practice of most citizens and nations was pacifism and exclusion.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents in his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his old job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different eras; Every stage of China or every family that has power is a certain dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also a period of division of provinces. The best known of these is the Three Kingdoms period that took place over a period of 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasty.
During this time, fierce warfare took place between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China, thousands of people died vying for the highest position in the luxurious palace in Xiâ€™an.
There were many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Also after the Revolution jobs opened up to all male applicants who were given the opportunity to be the most ambitious and successful in success.
The same can be said with regard to the military, because instead of army ranks being based on class, they are now based on combat prowess.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working-class people of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad took a deep interest in things beyond this worldly life. He used to go to the cave that became known as "Hira" on the Mount of "Noor" (light) for his meditation.
the cave itself, which has survived the ages, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not really easy to find even if someone knows it exists. Once inside the cave, it's completely isolated.
There is nothing to see but clear, beautiful skies and the many surrounding mountains. Only a small part of this world can be seen or heard inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of seven spectacular sights that still survives today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the massive pyramidal structures built to honor the late Pharaoh.
The Plateau of Giza, or "Necropolis of Giza" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt has many pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, many temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upward dizziness" mark looks like a V and the "downward dizziness" mark looks like a staple or a square without the bottom part.
Upward means you should start at the end and push the slope, and down means you should start with the frog (where your hand is holding the slope) and pull the slope.
Up-to-slip often creates a weaker sound, while down-to-earth is louder and more insistent.
Feel free to write your own marks with a pencil, but remember that printed marks for the movement of the pencil are there for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
Terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced by a crowd of market women to return to Paris from Versailles on 6th October 1789.
In a carriage, they travelled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The King and Queen were forced to open the windows of their carriages because of the mobs.
On one occasion a member of the crowd waved the head of the head of the king's guard who had been killed at Versailles in the presence of the terrified Queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism in its conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to finance a large portion of the expenses and the interest on bonds sold in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, it is the excess profits that have come from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people that will constitute the main advantage of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must know the context that prompted the formation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is often referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a myriad of ideas in practice, from the push of technology or the extreme technological necessity to the precise understanding that human destiny is motivated by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their technological manifestation.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the very advancement of technology follows a path that transcends cultural or political power, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are natural, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that the car is the driving force behind the construction of roads.
However, the national network of roads would not be a profitable business if it were only for a few vehicles, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Owning multiple cars leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which has led to the invention of new health care techniques for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism has a large element of cultural determinism, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time the customs and cultures associated with that geography evolved, and they, being appropriate to the place of society, were superior to unreasonably imposed laws.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its recognition as a center of luxury began in 400 A.D. and lasted until 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the twelfth century due to the fact that Christian invaders or Crusaders returned with gifts such as silks and spices that were even more valued than the Byzantine market could provide.
It was during this period that the title of the Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at the peak of popularity between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th centuries.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow flow of communication, western fashions can be delayed for 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest advances at the time as a result of the crusades was that people started using buttons to close clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is practiced to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses salvaged seeds that are native to the eco-region along with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bind together like-minded people who feel they are being neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be unique due to the age, ethnicity, status, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as unique may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a unique and figurative use of style, which includes fashions, customs, and vulgar language.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to base the few undesirable circumstances of children who have not been taught good behavior by adults as they grow up through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse.
Such children are called "wild" or ferocious. Some stray children have previously been trapped by humans (often their own parents); In other cases this abandonment of the child is due to the parental rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children who have limited contact with people from an early age may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or run away.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals; Others are said to have lived in the jungle alone.
When fully reared by animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) that are similar to those exhibited by the caring animal, such as its fear or cold treatment of humans.
While project-based learning should facilitate and make learning interesting, support formulation does much more than that.
Providing components for learning or scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather a aid that provides support to individuals going through a new learning experience using, for example, a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real. That is, a teacher is a form of scaffold as well as Clippy of Microsoft Office.
Virtual support frameworks are embedded in the software and are intended to ask, hint, and clarify procedures that may have been difficult for the student to deal with on their own.
Children are placed in orphanages for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not caring, caring, and teachable, but they are there.
We consider orphanages to be a safe place for these children.
Our shelter system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, continuing education, and reliable health care.
The orphanage should provide for all the necessities that were not available in the original home from which they were taken.
The Internet unifies the elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet allow for additional forms of use and gratification.
For example, "studying" and "socializing" have been suggested as important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated listeners' reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in interpreting tiny expressions, facial movements that only occur for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that a person can determine whether a person is lying by properly interpreting its small expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, has indicated how people who cannot understand speech due to brain injury are nevertheless able to assess honesty correctly.
He further suggested that such abilities for interpreting human behavior might be the same in animals as in domesticated dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic diversity: covert and overt.
A mutation adds new genetic diversity, and selection removes it from the pool of variations actually available.
Separation and recombination mix variation back and forth between the two pools in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino-acid requirement from plant sources.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences: slowed growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant resources to obtain are the proteins found in leaves and vegetable seeds, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest them unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, animal foods (ants, ants, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they provide an abundance of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in pretty much the same way that savanna apes do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up while in your normal sleep period and returning to sleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring your consciousness back without completely waking you up.
If you find yourself changing the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of your room, to force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biological rhythm-based options require drinking plenty of water (specifically water or tea, a well-known urinalysis) before going to bed, prompting one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is correlated with the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force that exists. Everyone has the potential to find complete peace and serenity.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been extended by the path of Mahayana love and the myriad techniques derived from Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all lovers.
In Kundalini Yoga the energy of Kundalini (energy of lightness) is aroused in the way of yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods. Through visualization in the minds of the various gods, the energy tunnels are cleared, the chakras become active and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany became an enemy of all during World War 2, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. By the end of the war system, processes and cultural conflicts had caused disharmony among nations.
Within two years of the end of the war, the former allies had turned hostile and the Cold War began.
It will last for the next 40 years and will be genuinely fought by proxy armies in conflict zones from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and elsewhere.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had been destroyed, and the only hope was to retreat and re-reinforce along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and formed Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Agreement, the Soviet-Polish Treaty of Non-Aggression.  and other international agreements, whether bilateral or multilateral.
Using ships for transporting products is the best of all for moving large numbers of people and products across the oceans.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country can maintain the ability to move its people and products, while at the same time, hindering your adversary's ability to move its people and products.
One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of WWII (World War II). The Americans were then trying to smuggle men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, whose main use was U-boats, was then trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed by chance, Germany would probably have conquered Britain as it had done in metropolitan Europe.
Goats seem to have been domesticated nearly 10,000 years ago in Iran's Zagros Mountains.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to care for them for the easy availability of milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Pet goats are often placed in flocks that roam the mountains or other pastures, often tended by shepherds who are often children or young people, similar to the more well-known shepherds. The method of tending the herd is still in use today.
Wagon tracks have been made in England as early as the 16th Century.
Although the carts consisted of parallel wooden planks, this allowed horses to pull faster on them and pull larger loads than the slightly rougher roads.
Railroads were used early to keep the rails stationary. Gradually, however, it was realized that the rails would be better off if they had a narrow piece of steel on top.
This practice became widespread, but steel caused the wooden wheels of carriages to become increasingly intertwined.
Eventually, wooden tires were replaced by steel tires. In 1767, the first all-iron railroad was introduced.
The first known transport was walking, where humans began walking vertically two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (i.e. standing man).
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not walk as straight as they used to.
Bipedal specimens are found in Australopithecus fossils that are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have been able to walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more harmlessly in our environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering in some way.
It is similar to the treatment of symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't want a temporary remedy, then we should look for the root of the problems and stop them from working.
It's clear enough that the world has changed dramatically because of humanity's scientific and technological advances, and that the problems have become more serious because of overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyles of people.
After Congress ratified it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
Throughout the night between 150 and 200 copies were produced, which are now known as "Dunlap posts".
The first public reading of the document was held by John Nixon on the grounds of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his soldiers in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
A lot of people don't believe they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are so many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk with both hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on controlling information encoded by binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, e.g. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits – or bits, when the term is used.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are generally severe enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be performed.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic chemicals in the home.
Check the label for specific instructions for first aid for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term is derived from the ancient existence of a thorough knowledge of the Surots, which are insects that are well-adapted to feed on humans.
Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs both depend for a long time on those who give birth after they are born, adapted to live in the nest or nest of their host.
Across the United States of America, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), it is considered a major neurological disorder in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spine and the optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child, to raise a baby.
A couple may decide to adopt their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their rights as parents so that another spouse can raise the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This approach actually guides most scientific research.
By no means alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on classical texts and, especially, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, are accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West found itself drifting away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in body structure and behavior are highly dependent on what happens within their bodies and their production through the biological clock.
Seasonal rhythms, which are not just responses to external seasonal cues, have been documented in most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue the period of free-running cycling even in the absence of external signals.
Hershey and Chase's experiment is one of the leading suggestions that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to put their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments that labeled either the DNA in the phage using radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects based on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are cells for sexual reproduction.
Only mutations in cells of the germ range can be passed on to offspring, while mutations anywhere else can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting places in nature for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including forest plants and animals.
Examples of actual activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visits to parks and learning about environmental information.
An example is visiting, taking photos, and learning about organgatuangs in Borneo.
Every day, people leave the country's small towns by car to get to their places of work and pass others whose place of work is the place where they came from.
In this dynamic transportation all people are somehow connected to, and supporting, a transportation system based on private vehicles.
Today's science suggests that this massive coal economy has stripped the ecological system (biosphere) of its one stable state that has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do these systems have such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers really incompetent? Or is there something more important going on?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with each other.
Sadly, the analysis of traffic flow is not easy because the driver's behavior cannot be estimated with scientific certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to stay within the immutable range; Thus, the traffic flow is also unchanged and can be estimated using mathematics.
To better describe traffic flow, relationships were made between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) weight, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in planning, designing, and managing facilities along the way.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped make it easier for them to cover their opponents and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of having the ability to fold their wings along with the body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are squirrels and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people believed he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, along with the Sun (and also other stars).
This seems to make sense, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes up to six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the seas comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It gathers water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the pyramid with stone did not stop until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and in the technical prowess of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest free country in the world and the least populous country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legal and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most people working in the state while Latin is most commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, inasmuch as all of them can be discovered in nature in indigenous form and can be easily mined using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, assumed that all things are composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. They are earth, water, air, and fire.
It is more similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also assumes that they become new objects to form what we see.
Alloys are usually mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table and some of them are also metals (such as calcium and potassium) and can be mixed with other metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys mixed with a few non-metallic elements such as coal.
Everything in space is made up of matter. Everything is made up of tiny objects called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, trillions of them can fit the dot at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it came out.
Sadly, as new ways of writing emerged, pencil was put on a lower status and uses.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, which will never have to be approached by the wizard.
One will only know what might happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy must combine the nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Perhaps it was like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. So splitting the nucleus back makes everyone else release that energy.
Some atoms are those with an imbalance of proton and neutron counts which means they tend to disappear when there is little or no matching number of protons and neutrons.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick in the near side and 100 km thick in the far side.
It is thinner under the mary and thicker under the high ground.
There may be more mares in the part of the world because the surface of the earth is thinner. It is easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around finding what will motivate people or grab their attention.
These theories suggest that people have certain specific needs and/or desires that they embrace as they age.
These theories are about what drives some people to want what they do and what things in their environment drive them to do or not do things.
Two well-known theories of content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge as managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the male companions" (or women).
This type of manager has a hard time making decisions that many won't like, discipline, assess performance, assign responsibility, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels he or she must change everything the group is already doing and make it his/her own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the group.
This behavior often results in misunderstandings between leaders and other colleagues in the group.
Virtual groups are also held to the same standards of well-being as standard groups, but with subtle differences.
Virtual group members often serve as a point of contact for their own physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of a regular group because their groups can meet according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local administration.
The presence of a real "invisible group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a distinct part of the virtual group.
An "invisible team" is the supervisory team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of building a learning organization? One goal for actively implementing an organization's learning concepts is innovation.
If all resources are used effectively across an organization's active departments, creativity and ingenuity can be revealed.
As a result, the process of the organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the customer's need.
Before an organization can develop innovations, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and learning as an organization.
Angel (2006), explains Continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating learning ability. Therefore it limits the field of research and makes it more precise.
Scientists in their research promote the connection between brain pathology and behavior.
It has been known for a very long time that various types of brain injuries, traumatic experiences, wounds, and bizarre lumps affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The proliferation of new technology has allowed us to see and analyze brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It provides us with a wealth of information and material to develop simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong definition of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, which is about the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Al's research includes building machines that will automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
AI's tasks include controlling, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer reviews and questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice and human faces.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The Al system is now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as has been done in software applications for many home computers and video games.
Field trips are a big part of every classroom. Teachers often like to rush their students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers the solution through virtual instructional tours. Students can look at artifacts in the museum, visit the aquarium, or admire the beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing an educational trip in a virtual way is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with in-person classes.
For example, each year Bennet School students in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, each year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as scrapbooks.
Blogs can also help to improve students' writing. Although students often start their blog writing experience with poor grammar and spelling, it is usually changed by having readers.
Since students are often the most critical of the audience, the blog writer began to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "forces students to be smarter about the world around them." The need to provide the interest of the audience arouses students to be cunning and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blog writing is a way that sparks collaboration, and encourages students to continue learning beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs" can enable students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to materials on the Internet, students can determine their positions in the context of those written by others as well as formulate their own views on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's vibrant, bilingual capital and features numerous galleries and art museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the far south is Niagara Falls and to the north is home to the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as what would be considered Canadian by outsiders.
Vast areas to the north are sparsely populated and others are mostly uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and can be considered a continent when it comes to wilderness.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as fancy beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it became very important in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The Sahel borders the region to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that any women traveling say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It would help to wear a ring as well (as long as it doesn't look too expensive.)
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment and that it is common for them to be followed, held on the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand up (cultural differences or not, it's still unacceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and gave it the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the places in all of Morocco that isn't an interesting place to go shopping.
Around the old Medina you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, clay utensils, animal skin utensils, hookahs, and all kinds of brothels, but all of them are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo in its easternmost neighboring Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that covered most of the town's roads, particularly in the town centre.
Although Goma is safe enough, any visit outside of Goma should be researched to understand the state of the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla treks in Africa.
You can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around the rubble. The usual (local) charge is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Along with its inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for exotic and far-flung lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a thriving village, although its reputation is due to its popularity as a tourist destination, and it has a train station.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of endangered world heritage sites, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main attractions of Henry Louis Gates in his PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is very different from all the other cities in the country, as it has more Arabic style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and straddles the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the border to the south is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each of which supports a variety of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered to be the pride of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there is a fee for day-to-day conservation and access to the park.
It can also be useful for one to purchase a Forest Card, which will allow access to any of the selected parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the area recognized by many tourists as the main destination.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong's soaring buildings is likened to a glittering bar chart seen by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
To see the best of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Much of Hong Kong's urban development is in the thick of reclaimed land on the north coast.
This is the area that the British invaders claimed as theirs and so if you're looking for proof of the territory's colonial past, this place is ideal to start with.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove along the coast in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) into the provinces of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that is in the territory of India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps – they include some of the last remaining hopes of the mighty forests that once covered the Ganga plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which one-third is submerged in water/swamp areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary, and there are now an estimated 409 Royal Bengal tigers and nearly 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, though most of them, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is a good idea to buy a ticket in advance for a few days.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are convenient and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby areas, such as Paro (NU 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a bridge supported by cables. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 metres, are 378 metres long and have two aisles of 3.50 m wide.
The height of the space under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is set to be fully operational in September 2017, when the construction of the Brazilian customs investigation stations will be completed.
The GuaranÃ were the most important indigenous group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as nomadic hunters who also engaged in agriculture for their livelihood.
The Chaco region has been home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycura and Payagua, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," was born as a result of a conflict between Spanish invaders and indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began a period of conquest that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of AsunciÃ³n in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain many of its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo field in Las CaÃ±itas.
Smaller tournaments and battles can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on the tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP) which is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley across the street from the Western FIC store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands and on Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also often accepted.
On distant islands credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American money may be obtained; Check with the owners first to find out what is the best way to pay.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falklands outside the islands, so it will be necessary to exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it winters in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; In the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop more than there is ice, but the air and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no specific "rainy season" and "drought" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wild animals are nevertheless ferocious and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park managers say stay at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter away from all other wild animals!
No matter how meek they look, bison, elk, moose, bears, and just about any other large animal can attack.
Every year, many of the visitors get injured because they don't maintain proper distance. These animals are large, ferocious, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, it should be known that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval ceasefire in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All of the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the assassination of the most important chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are plenty of beaches, as Auckland is between two ports. The most popular ones are in three places.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
It's mostly sandy beaches where it's safe to dive into the water, most of which have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in Waitemata Harbour, in the expensive vicinity of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
They are once bustling beaches frequented by families and have a good range of shops to be found on the shore. It is safe to swim in the sea.
The main local beer is 'Numero Uno', it's not a complicated beer, but rather pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are plenty of French wines that can be purchased, but New Zealand and Australian wines can be better served on the trip.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're scared.
For Australians, the idea of coffee 'flat white' is foreign. The short black is 'espresso', the cappuccino comes with a high heap of cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is by Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but they are very tasty.
Many reef trips occur throughout the year, and damage caused by any reef-related factors is rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, follow all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Jellyfish spawn near coastlines and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They are occasionally seen outside of these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively inhabit the ocean, their main habitat being in the river basins north from Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they have a place to stay once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although it is possible that you may be able to book other types of accommodation, such as a place for camping, through the travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or even packages that combine flight and hotel.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to study the offer or take care of other paperwork for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests should be made to the travel agency's representative and not to the hotel itself.
For some festivals, the vast majority of those who attend music festivals decide to camp in the area itself, and the majority of those who attend consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, make it early to get a place to stay near the music.
Keep in mind that even if the music on the main stages is over, there may be parts of the celebration where the music will continue to play well into the night.
Some festivals have designated camping spots for families with small children.
When going to the Northern Baltic during the winter, check the location of the sleeping house, as going to the ice can cause quite serious noise for those who are deliberately affected.
Sea trips to Saint Petersburg require spending time in town. Travelers are exempt from requirements for validity (see terms).
Casinos typically put a lot of effort into maximizing the time and money that visitors spend. Windows and clocks are often missing, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drinks and entertainment, to keep guests feeling good, and to keep them in place.
Some places offer free wine. Drunkenness, however, impairs decision-making, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying intoxicated.
Anyone who drives at high latitudes or on mountain roads should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On muddy and snowy roads, there isn't too much friction and you won't be able to drive like you're on asphalt.
During snowstorms, there is enough snow to stop you from falling in a very short amount of time.
The ability to see falling or blowing snow or condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows may also be limited.
On the other hand, muddy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic is undisturbed throughout the year.
Animal sightings or safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the feature for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to a trip on land to view Africa's stunning wildlife, particularly the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get too close to cars and the common equipment can allow for a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are shy at times, and you'll see them more with sleds.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "stomping") involves hiking, possibly over a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. A number of events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to host two Summer Olympics, having already hosted the Games in 1964.
If you've already booked flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation rules vary, but since late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies don't extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ��2,500 and ¥130,000, with the average ticket costing ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help to dry them. Many hotels have iron and iron that can be seated, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (this causes the clothing to shrink, or in severe cases, burns).
There are various methods of purifying water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is enough, in others, more than a minute is required.
The effectiveness of filters vary, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they do not know in their region of origin.
