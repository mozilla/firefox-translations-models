Stars emit light and heat due to the energy of the emergence of a compound (or a merger) of hydrogen atomic, when more difficult elements arise.
Scientists work to create a reactor that can make energy in the same way.
However, this is the problem of which the solution is very complex and therefore still lasts for many years until we know to build useful fusion reactors.
Steel needle is hovered to the water level because there is a surface voltage.
Surface voltage is due to the fact that water molecules on the water level are attracted to each other stronger than the air molecules above them.
Water molecules create an invisible jacket that allows such phenomena such as floating needle on the water surface.
Modern skates on ice have knives with double playful and with a consonable attachment between edges. Two edges make it possible to better attract to ice, even during the loading of the knife.
Because the bottom of the knife is slightly rounded, as the knife is inserted from the side to the side, it also resembles a game that comes into contact with ice.
This will cause the skater turns. If the skate tilts the skates right, it turns right if the skates tilt to the left, turns to the left.
In order to get back to your default energy level, it is necessary to get rid of excess energy they have gained from light.
They do this using the emitting of a small amount of light, which is called phototone.
Scientists have named this process with the expression of "excellent emisia radiation", because atoms are stimulated by a clear light that causes the discharge of the photo zone of light, while the light is kind of radiation.
The following picture is shown atoms as they emit photons. The truths are photons in fact much smaller than those in the picture.
Photos are even smaller than what they consist of atoms!

These plants look like small palms with a crown of sharp, pinch leaves.
Triceratops could use its powerful beak for rubbing leaves from the trunk and then cut it off.
Other scientists claim that these plants are very poisonous, so it is unlikely to consume them some dinosaurs, although today's lies and other animals such as parrots (potomatoes) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.

The disadvantage of the lens with the help is that the complexity of the fire and the number of optical elements necessary for proper functioning of the range of focal distances is much greater than when lens with a solid fireplace.
It is a gradually increasingly smaller problem, since the lens manufacturer is able to achieve higher standards in the manufacture of lenses.
This has enabled the lens with the help of creating pictures in the quality comparable to that they achieve lens with a fixed focal distance.
Another drawback of transfectators is that the maximum visor (speed) lens is usually less.
