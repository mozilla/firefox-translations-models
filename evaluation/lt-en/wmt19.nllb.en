As the opposition, as it had already said, the Constitutioniam Teismui (KT) appealed against the decision of the ruling party to pass a law on the possibility of stopping the status of waste-to-energy plants.
On Thursday, the opposition Seimo-Lithuanian Christian Democratic Union (TS-LKD) faction announced that a group of Seimo members had appealed to the KT, demanding that the ruling parties disqualify the Atletics' formal laws from being in conformity with the Constitution.
"Parliamentarians stress that the legal provisions of the law aim to question the projects of waste disposal facilities currently underway, paving the way for the Government to establish a novus apribojimus (20 km from residential areas) before the entry into force of the law on Vilnius and Kaune pradėtoms statyti waste disposal plants", - stated in the statement.
"Parliamentarai notes, that given the fact that the law suformuluotas draudimas statyti tvarkymo refuse tvarkymo objectus of state significance (i.e. determinomas distumas ir defined as "governmental territories" sąvoka), darytina evaded, that this prohibition is disproportionate to ribojama ar net paneigiama itself the right to carry out agricultural activities, related to waste disposal energy gaminti, esmé, noting the criteria suformuluoti taip, kad, evaluus tankumą i pasting Lietuvos gyventojų in the country, statytiškalos objektus would be practically impossible on the whole territory of the country", - priduriama jamei.

Jame also noted that large financial investments have already been made in the Vilniaus and Kauno cogeneration power plant projects.
If the state stopped the projects currently underway, the state would suffer hundreds of millions of dollars in financial losses, huge losses to the Lithuanian population - the heating prices would rise, the increased waste levels would increase, and the environmental pollution would increase.
The Kreipimsi to the KT was signed by members of the Seimo TS-LKD, the Liberal Council, the Social Democratic factions and the ruling Social Democratic Labour faction, senior deputy Algirdas Butkevičius.
A few weeks ago, the seimas ruling balsais managed to collect 71 votes, when they vetoed President Dalios Grybauskaitė's veto of the Atletics Act, which gave the government the right to stop the existing power station status, and also established a 20-km quarantine zone of residential areas such as power stations.
According to pakartotinai, the law passed by the parliament took effect on 1 January 2019.
This proposal is scheduled to be discussed at the Seimo rudens session.
However, the government's right to suspend already-implemented projects is not planned.
KT will consider this case in a sequential manner - no earlier than a year later.

Grybauskaitė has urged China to make more investment in the environment than the EU.
President Dalia Grybauskaitė urged China to create a more balanced investment environment for European Union (EC) countries, especially in terms of foreign imports.
Speaking at the Shanghai Chinese import parody of the Trade and Investment Forum, D. Grybauskaitė stressed that in view of the economic downturns in Europe and China, the common goal should be "to stabilize the world's protectionism", and to address the growing trade tensions, "excess production and unfair competition".
"China's commitment to creating an attractive, open investment environment is very important to the European Union - or, more importantly, the trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign trade is safe and secure here, as well as stiprinant protection of intellectual property", said D. Grybauskaitė.
Note that China's opening up is important not only for Europe, but also for the country and the global economy.
Lithuanian women's rights activist stressed that investment transparency should be "higher than the interests of any business group".
"Skybrids, the rule of law, stricter international treaty compliance - or it should be the focus of the new investment relationship environment", - stressed D. Grybauskaitė.
"Corrupt capital flows should not be laukiami in any country in the world - not just here in our countries", he added.

Lithuania's exports to China have increased by 50 percent - or 180 million euros.
That amounted to more than 820 million euros in imports from China.
Officials are alarmed when Chinese investments in Lithuania can have a negative political impact, or Beijing's exclusive focus on Eastern Europe and the EU's unity.

However, he stood up and was shocked when the members of the family, R. Kirana, who had been a member of the family and had been a victim of sexual abuse, and his brother Kusnanu, who founded Lion Air in 1999, were arrested.
"Lion Air" behaved badly", said one man, referring to Shandy Johano Ramadhano, a former prosecutor in the saloon, where planes flew to.

Presidency: no need for any dirty pleas about a referendum.
The Seimas approved the proposal of the sitting members to reduce the referendum cartel, which currently has greater protection under the first section of the Constitution, Presidentė pataisas vetoos, said her adviser Mindaugas Lingė.
"More than half the population has ratified the Constitution - that is a requirement.
These and other issues, especially those in the first section, should certainly be overwhelmingly majority.
If you don't think about it, the president would definitely veto", Dalios Grybauskaitė, an adviser on domestic policy, told Žinių radio on Tuesday.
In addition, since the first section of the Constitution defines the basic state elements - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty, therefore, if the articles were reduced to change the number of votes required, M. Lingės notes, "neigiamas precedentas" would be created and "neither risks taken".
"In the president's opinion, no more dirty negotiations are needed, rather a referendum itself is needed, more dialogue is needed with the people", - said the president.
The Seimas planned to vote on Tuesday on the referendum bill after it was passed.
Today, it is anticipated that a decision on a higher protection of the Constitution under Section I of Section XIV will be adopted if, by referendum, at least two-fifths of eligible citizens are eligible to vote.
Currently, the Articles of First and Fourteenth Section of the Constitution are being amended by a referendum by more than a quarter of all citizens with voting rights.
The right to vote in Lithuania has about 2.5 million citizens: 1.25 million voters, two pencendali - one million voters.
This proposal came about after the Seimas approved the presidential veto in September on previously passed parliamentary bills, which lowered the voting requirement to change citizenship under Article 12 of Section One of the Constitution.
The referendum bill proposes a reduction in the number of people preparing for the referendum on dual citizenship, which should take place on May 12 and May 26 of next year, when the first and second presidential elections are scheduled.
Those who emigrated after independence on March 11, 1990, cannot currently, with some exceptions, have dual citizenship.
The world's Lithuanian community seeks dual citizenship, but when referendums are unlikely under the conditions of the current situation, the number of people voting for atheists is not enough.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian oro uostai "braška", which means they need to be updated.
Lithuania's road infrastructure has been abandoned and needs to be upgraded, according to susisiekimo ministras Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the Vilniaus oro uosto upgrade is a minimalus uždavinys, which the state must carry out.
"Our transport infrastructure is already poor, as it was planned to be smaller than the traffic flow.
I must refresh Vilniaus or uostą - or even not participate in total planning, or there are minimum things that must be done", - said Masiulis on Tuesday at a conference held in the journal "Valstybė" on the initiative of the Democracy Development Fund.
According to the minister, the next decade of buses is crucial, as important projects will have to be implemented - the completion of the "Via Baltica", "Rail Baltica", the construction of Klaipėdos externainis uostas, the upgrading of Vilniaus ir Kauno oro uostai, or perhaps the construction of new oro uostas.
"Seventy-seven buses are very important - we have a roadmap, rail integration, external road Klaipėdoje statybas, sutvarkyti oro uostus, perhaps decide on the new road construction.
Turime nemiegoti, we are now starting projects that will exploit our potential for 10, 20, or 30 years", said susisiekimo ministras.
Pltonas Masiulis cardboard, when car road maintenance is spent on little in recent years.
"The situation in the poor is deteriorating because there is insufficient funding.
Although most often built up to the new keliu, the funds are lacking for the most basic supervision, such as the keliuose in the magistral courts.
Privalome determined the amount that should be allocated to the maintenance of roads, if normed, in order to improve their condition", - said P. Masiulis.
He stressed that Lithuania's exports of transport services increased by 18.6%, the largest export market being Germany, followed by Russia.
Ponas Masiulis has once again criticized the European Commission's proposal that EC carriers be required to periodically return the goods to the country of registration.
"It's a very important thing to remember when our Western European exporters feel at home.
In my opinion, the proposed willkikams to be constantly returned home are absurd, since in Europe there would be no more sunsets, no more sunsets, no more emissions.
Most of these will be railways, since most of the transportation will be on the railways.
We have found ways to defend our positions", said Father Masiulis.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the transport sector is growing at a rate of 12.2%.

Note that in the 1960s and early 1990s, the buildings listed were a reality, registered in 1993, and neither politicians nor specialists have to decide on their demolition.
Ponas Masiulis then commented that, when modernus arriimo terminlas were introduced, Lithuania's image of gerinism would be enhanced.
"The fact that this old terminal would be removed would be a politically significant step, if it could be constructed and a new modern arrival terminal, such as the Vilnius separridus jaustis modernie in the country, or an interesting, certainly unrepresentative place for our country as an innovative one", said Mr Masiulis.
Ponas Masiulis then also announced that Kaune was planning to build a completely new railway terminal with the aim of connecting to the "Baltic Rail" line, building a ground floor.
This transportation network is expected to be operational by 2026, according to the Rail Baltica.

Israelis are particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighboring Syria and have vowed not to abandon the entrenched criminal approach.
The other treaty participants - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - opposed the US decision to withdraw, as the agreement, as planned, had so far prohibited Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.

VRK party distributes money, but does not give anything to social workers.
The VC Elections Commission (VRK) this week distributed almost 3 million euros of budgetary allocation to the two largest political parties.
In the spring of this year, the ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), led by parliamentary deputy prime minister Gedimino Kirkilo, set up a task force to allocate funds from the budget.
Bets may be made in the near future to a separate VRK decision, if the legal environment changes, governing the allocation of grants to parties.
Laura Matjošaityte, VRK president, informavo VŽ, said that "this Thursday there will be a commission posėdis, in which a decision on the budgetary distribution of the party's annual budgetary allocation is planned".
According to the report, the VRK has to decide on the matter by November 15.
Numatoma septynioms partijoms, six of which are parliamentary, allocated 2.751 million euros.
The opposition Christian Democrats of the Union of Lithuanian-Homelands should receive more than 0.66 million euros, the Walsh and Green Alliance - about 0.55 million euros, the opposition Social Democrats - about 0.5 million euros, the opposition Liberal Union - almost 0.4 million euros, the Seime of their faction, the Darbo Party - about 0.23 million euros, the recently elected Tvarkos and Justice Party - about 0.22 million euros, the parliament representing neither the ruling party nor the opposition, the Lenksk elections campaign - about 0.18 million euros.
Under the current law, which is administered by the VRK, and allocating budgetary funds, grants are allocated to parties that meet the statutory requirements and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last Seimas, councils and elections to the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulations do not allow the LSDDP to be established in the spring and expect to receive money from the budget.

However, this will not be done before this quarterly VRK session, and therefore, according to P. Matjošaitytės, "donations are made according to the legal procedure that has existed to date".
However, the VRK's proposal failed, as if the Seimas were to veto the presidential vote this week or next week and to approve new amendments to the party budget, the commission could decide on additional appropriations for political parties, including the LSDDP.
"When making a decision we take into account the entire legal environment in place, as we examine the executive authority, the executive authority, the executive authority to implement the laws we adopt", she said.
If the Seimas were to veto and new laws were to come into force, the additional money would be allocated to the parties by the government, and the additional amount would be passed on to the parties.
The Septyniom parties have already allocated grants for such a decision.

The cost of health care and other health problems, such as cholera and others, has been reduced to $233 billion.

Talks about a possible Brexit compromise are now being made.
The leaders of the United Kingdom and Ireland on Monday discussed a possible compromise on the complex Northern Ireland issue, the Brexit derby, Dublinas reported.
Speaking by telephone, British Prime Minister Theresa May suggested that the mechanism of the Agreement on Insurance Measures be reviewed, which would leave the border between the United Kingdom's Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the European Union, open.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkaras had promised to consider the proposal, but he denied any possibility of Britain unilaterally withdrawing from the agreement, the Irish government said in a statement.
Mr Pokalbyje Th. May "opened the possibility of examining the mechanism of the insurance measures", it said.
"Varadkaras will understand that, when new proposals are open to review, they are subject to the condition that the results of such a review are not related to a unilateral decision to discontinue the application of the funding measures", the government statement said.
Brexit supporters have made a final decision on how to avoid checks on the United Kingdom and Ireland's securities, as Britain withdraws from the single market and customs union in January next year.
Both sides agreed to "safeguard measures" to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open, as soon as a trade agreement of greater scale was signed, to ensure that additional customs checks on the border would not be carried out.
In the case of Northern Ireland, the customs rules of the European Union will continue to be applied, but in the case of London, they will be applied temporarily to the whole of the Carolingian Jungle.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominicas Raabas was seeking a three-month unilateral withdrawal from the UK's financing agreement.

Seimas has approved didesnes baudas už kenksmingltus products.
The Seimas has proposed the product safety law, which provides that fines for product safety violations should be imposed.
The Pataisoms in the seating room of Pritarta vienbalsiai.
As Seimo Sveikatos Affairs Committee chairman Antanas Vinkus said, speaking about the new project, the health and safety of the public concerned with consumer protection of geresne products.
However, the provisions are based on the requirements of the European Parliament and Council decision.
"Mano galva, we propose legislation to be specifically distributed to all those involved in the supply and platinum processes: producers, service providers, importers, platinum producers, and others.
As is common practice, the current system of fines does not always prevent further violations, since the subject, having paid the fine, continues to inflict pakartotinus violaimus", said A. Vinkus.
The draft was prepared by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and after the Government's approval the Economic and Social Committee supplemented it with its proposals.
The bill aims to prevent violations, strengthen consumer protection, give more leverage to market surveillance authorities and create a system of oversight of product safety requirements and compliance.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, at present, manufacturers have not been found to have any problem properly labeling the product and thus ensuring its safety.
However, according to the ministries, market surveillance authorities carrying out state product safety checks have not been granted the right to patch the territory of manufacturers and suppliers, to build a pavilion, patalpas, to carry out inspections, or to undermine the work of the authorities.
The Ministry's assessment is that the six-month deadline for fines and warnings is for Trump to identify a breach, conduct an investigation and issue a fine.
In addition, according to the ministries, the imposed baudges are not effective enough.
Companies often fail to comply with the law - in 2017, they made 14 companies.
The Ministry of Finance proposed that producers be required to properly label the lamb and ensure its integrity, so that market surveillance authorities can more easily explain the requirements to non-compliant lamb suppliers.
It is also proposed to give market surveillance authorities the power, through state product safety controls, to make patents to the entities that produce, supply or sell products, including the country, the built-up area, the patalpas, to carry out inspections.
It is not possible to increase the fines for violations of the law.
The game, import and authorized representative, the manufacturer of dangerous goods, the platinum dealer, the manufacturer of dangerous goods, the supplier of dangerous goods and services would be fined between 150 and 2 500 euros (from 144 to 1 448).
The State Consumer Protection Agency (VVTAT) and the market surveillance authority decided that if the sale of dangerous sheep and the supply of dangerous goods or services were stopped, a fine of between 1,000 and 5,000 euros (from 868 to 4,344) would be imposed.
Failure to comply with the requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, to return them to consumers and to destroy them would result in a fine of between 2500 and 6 500 euros (from 1 448 to 5 792).
If the dangerous products were harmful to the health of the consumer, a fine of between 2,500 and 15,000 euros (from 1,448 to 1,1584) would be imposed.
If the dangerous products caused the death of the consumer, a fine of between 6,500 and 25,000 euros (from 5,792 to 23,169) would be imposed.
According to the ministries, in Poland and Austria, a fine of up to 25 thousand bauds (minimalus baudos dydis nenustatytas) is imposed for breaches of product safety legislation, in Belgium - from 26 to 600 thousand bauds, in Romania - from 155 to 6 666 bauds, in Bulgaria - from 125 to 7 500 bauds.
