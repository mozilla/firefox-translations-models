Ethics watchdogs: The Board of the Liberal Movement is right about the act of the Vilnius branch
"The decisions adopted by the Board comply with the articles of association," its head Vytautas Tamošiūnas informed BNS after the meeting of the commission.
"Our decision wasn't something new.
We had already made an explanation as a commission in July, when there was a question about Pagėgiai and Utena.
Then we said that according to the bylaws, this is a matter of competence for the board.
And if the board decides that some department can do as it pleases - go with the committee and the board approves it, then the department can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the board has adopted, then it is a decision for all the chapters to form party lists.
And if you do not agree with the board, then there is an opportunity to suspend membership and go with the committee," he added.
According to V. Tamošiūnas, now the party board will decide on further actions.
On October 17, the board of the Liberal Movement of the party annulled the decision of the Vilnius City Branch to participate in the municipal elections not with the party's list, but with the newly formed election committee.
In the opinion of the party's board, the decision of the liberals of the capital to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party's bylaws, the decisions of the board.
By October 31, the Vilnius branch had to cancel the aspirations to participate in the municipal elections with the committee's list.
But the department didn't.
The former head of the department, parliamentarian Aušrine Armonaitė, has already left the Liberal Movement.
The mayor of Vilnius, the former chairman of the Liberal Movement Remigijus Šimašius, who promises to seek another term as the head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee "For Vilnius, of which we are proud!"
He also left the party.
Municipal council and mayoral elections will be held in March next year.
Residents of a village in northern India rode a tigress on a tractor that had previously stabbed one man, officials said Monday.
Forest steward Mahavir Kaujlagi (Mahavir Kaujlagi) said that when the tigress stabbed a man who worked in the fields late Sunday, the villagers surrounded the beast and, as the female tried to escape, drove her with a tractor.
Residents say that this tigress also attacked and insured one young man about 10 days ago.
The village in question is located in the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in Lakhympur Kher district, about 250 km southeast of Laknau, the capital of the state of Uttar Pradesh.
Galabyte tigers in protected areas is prohibited.
The reserve's director, Ramesh Pandey, said the case would be reported to police under the Wildlife Protection Act.
In April, in the Nighasan district of Uttar Pradesh state, villagers beat another tiger; he suffered serious injuries.
The tiger is the national animal of India; according to the Wildlife Protection Act, tigers are considered an endangered species.
Last year's government figures show that for the past three years, at least one person has been killed daily in clashes with wild tigers or elephants.
Human conflicts with tigers have been gradually increasing since the 8th, when India launched a program to protect tigers, according to which reserves were established in national parks, and the gallicing of large cats began to be considered a crime.
While the methods of counting tigers have changed, the censuses would indicate that the then population of about 1,800 tigers grew to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
It is proposed that cats and dogs should be marked with microchips on a mandatory basis
Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Environmental Protection Committee of the Seimas, together with other members of the Seimas, has registered amendments to the Law on the Welfare and Protection of Animals, which propose the mandatory marking of cats and dogs with subcutaneous microchips.
"We propose that cats and dogs should be marked with subcutaneous microchips, and their registration and marking should be organized by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be marked free of charge with state funds, and in 2020 - also cats, so residents will not be worried and the costs will be covered by specially provided state funding," said Kęstutis Mažeika, chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection.
The amendments to the law are aimed at solving the systematic need for the marking of pets.
It is hoped that this will help to avoid problems caused by irresponsible animal breeders, illegal multipliers or sellers.
It is tentatively estimated that all animal owners will be compensated during the transitional period on the basis of the expected average price of the microchip and the service, which will amount to about 5 euros.
The total cost of marking all pets can reach up to $ 6 million. Euro.
It is planned that the need for these funds will be distributed over three years and will amount to EUR 2 million annually. Euro.
It is planned that the funds for the labeling programs will be allocated through the Special Program for the Support of Municipal Environmental Protection, whose revenues will increase significantly this year due to increased taxes on natural resources and the redistribution of funds.
Municipalities will be able to use these funds not only for the marking of cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programs.
According to K. Mažeika, the practice of mandatory labelling is common in almost all European Union countries, which allows you to protect both the animals themselves (because the lost ones can easily be returned to the owners), and saves the time of the animal breeders themselves, when the search for a runaway and lost pet has to be spent a lot of time and money.
In addition, EU legislation stipulates that travel is only possible with tagged pets.
At the same time, labeling obliges you to responsibly take care of the animal throughout its life.
The previous proposals for mandatory labelling have met with resistance, as the relevant programmes have been proposed to be funded by the population.
"The model now being put forward should avoid this criticism, since animal protection is proposed to be financed by increased revenues in the environmental support program and giving the right to label not only to veterinarians, but also to public figures, i.e. persons of animal care institutions who have taken special courses at the Academy of Veterinary Medicine," the authors of the project say.
The draft law was registered by a group of Seimas members representing different political groups in the Seimas - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

"Women lie better" star actress B. Arsobaite is haunted by liars
Most likely, this is just a coincidence, but the charming brown-eyed actress Brigita Arsobaitė has been receiving roles related to liars for several generations.
Initially, the series "Women Lie Better", then the play "Liars" and finally the comedy "Liars".
In this film, Brigita plays the elusive wife of the hero of Dainius Kazlauskas.
"I really enjoyed filming in 'Liars' because I'm more of a theater actress and I rarely appear in the cinema.
The assembled amazing team of colleagues from the very beginning promised an excellent result.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the site was puppy Sunny!
All my life I thought that if I had a dog, it would definitely be big and serious.
I've never admired those little, decorative "fif" quadrupeds.
However, during the filming, Sunny became so attached to me that the sympathy became mutual and in the end I even wanted to buy it from the hostess, but to no avail," the actress smiles.
From the first minutes, a new Lithuanian comedy comedy "Liars", produced by Lithuanian film hits "Inexperienced" and "Among us, boys..." producer Paulius Virbickas and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimiras Razarionovas.
Your beloved has just announced - she is expecting.
That would be great news, just... your beloved is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
Having not had time to publish the "good news" to everyone, parents unexpectedly declare - they are different!
After 50 years together...
And all this happens just before the most beautiful holidays of the year - St. Patrick's Day. Christmas!
But the ending will surprise you even more, because no one expected such an atomazza.
All the heroes are not what it seemed at first glance...
In addition to B. Arsobaitė in the comedy "Liars", four generations of movie stars will give a good mood to the audience: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrė Giedraitytė, Liubomiras Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.
Comedy "Liars" - in the cinemas from November 9.
Will decide whether to write off the $100 million in damages. euros of unpaid taxes of expatriates
The Sejm on Tuesday passed an amendment to the Law on the Declaration of Residence prepared by the leader of the "peasants" Ramūnas Karbauskis.
56 members of the Seimas voted in favour, 9 against, and 25 abstained.
Next, the Seimas will proceed to the consideration of amendments on December 6 or later, after receiving the government's conclusion.
According to R. Karbauskis, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the parliamentarian, in three years one person does not pay about 1 thousand. euros, and now there are about 100 thousand such individuals.
The Social Democrat Algirdas Sysas regretted that in this way the Seimas would "urge some people not to comply with their obligations" - to declare their departure and then no taxes would be calculated.
Conservative Antanas Matulas, a member of the Committee on Health Affairs, noticed that Lithuanians living abroad take advantage of the fact that, paying a small health insurance fee, they come to Lithuania for treatment - they are provided with the same services as residents who pay this tax.
The amendments provide that those persons who will pay social security contributions in the Countries of the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation would be considered to be expatriates from Lithuania, and sodra would have exempted them from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
Mindaugas Sinkevičius, the head of "Sodra", has previously said that such a step will make life easier for both the people who emigrated and the activities of "Sodra".
Video about a slipping teddy bear circulating on the Internet reveals a serious problem
It is filmed as the mother bear climbs a steep snowy slope, and the toddler keeps climbing, slipping down and stubbornly climbing again.
The video has garnered a ton of views and comments.
People admired the perseverance of the little bear - having repeatedly slipped down, he would climb to his mother again.
He succeeds not from the first time, but the little one does not even try to give up and finally achieves his goal.
The video is indeed a matter of attention, but it also reveals the threat to animals posed by humans.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that the desire of people to know wildlife can sometimes be harmful.
"It's obvious to me that the bears were very frightened by the drone.
From their movements it can be seen that they are panicking.
If a drone didn't fly around, they probably would have chosen a safer path or overcome it more slowly or more cautiously.
It's a great example of how drones shouldn't be used," ecologist Mark Ditmer told The Verge publication.
Some time ago, M. Ditmer, together with colleagues, studied how drones affect bears.
The animals were fitted with heart work gauges.
When the drone approached, some bears would let themselves run, others would not run anywhere, but the hearts of all of them began to beat more often from fright.
Scientists advise using drones for filming animals responsibly, not to fly too close, not to make noise and not to fly where it is forbidden.
The escaped president was approached through a newspaper
A Kiev court on Tuesday invited the deposed President Viktor Yanukovych, who had retired to Russia, to appear at the hearing of the case regarding his alleged treason of the state in an unusual way - the summons was announced in the official journal of the state.
The subpoena, published in the government's news newspaper Uriadovoj kurjer, invites the former leader to attend a criminal hearing on November 19, during which his closing arguments could be heard.
The document states that V. Yanukovych has the right to attend the meeting by video link.
On October 30, the Kiev court announced the completion of the debate in the case of V. Yanukovych.
Alexander Goroshinsky, a lawyer for V. Yanukovych, who works in Russia, was given the opportunity to register in the register of foreign lawyers until November 19, so that he could attend the hearing, where V. Yanukovych is expected to have his last word by video link.
The Kremlin-backed Yanukovych was overthrown and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, provoked by the president's refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader was taken to Russia during a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed the Ukrainian-owned Crimean peninsula, and a little later, a war broke out in the east of the country between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists.
Since then, the fighting has killed about 10 thousand people. human lives, despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure a lasting ceasefire.

Restrictions on cogeneration power-plants appealed to the Constitutional Court
The opposition in the Seimas, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (KT) against the decision of the ruling parties to adopt a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition faction of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) in the Seimas reported that a group of Seimas members had appealed to the KT to investigate the conformity of the amendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by the rulers with the Constitution.
"Parliamentarians emphasize that the provisions of the law are aimed at questioning the projects of waste incinerators already underway, entrusting the Government with the task of imposing new restrictions (a distance of 20 km from the residential area) until the entry into force of the law for waste incineration plants that have begun to be built in Vilnius and Kaunas," the report reads.
'Parliamentarians point out that, in view of the way in which the law formulates the prohibition on the construction of objects of national importance for waste management (i.e. the distance is determined and the concept of a 'residential area' is defined), it must be concluded that this prohibition disproportionately limits or even negates the very essence of the right to carry out economic activities related to the incineration of waste for the production of energy, since the established criteria are formulated in such a way that, taking into account the density and distribution of the Lithuanian population in the country, it would be practically impossible to build such facilities throughout the territory of the country," it adds.
The appeal states that the law passed is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
"The CT has repeatedly stated that the legislation does not apply to those legal facts and consequences that occurred before the entry into force of the newly adopted legislation.
In this case, the Government is empowered to apply the law retroactively on the basis of an indeterminate criterion.
The introduction of such a legal regulation violates the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal certainty, protection of legitimate expectations, and therefore the constitutional principle of the rule of law," the appeal states.
It also notes that large financial investments have already been made in the projects of Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration power-plants.
If the ongoing projects were suspended, the state would suffer not only hundreds of billions of financial losses, huge losses would also be suffered by Lithuanian residents - heating prices would increase, and environmental pollution would increase due to the growing amount of waste disposal in landfills.
The appeal to the KT was signed by members from the Seimas TS-LKD, the Liberal Movement, the Social Democratic groups and algirdas Butkevičius, deputy dean of the ruling Social Democratic Labour Group.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas managed to garner 71 votes by the ruling parties in order to reject the veto of president Dalia Grybauskaitė's veto of the adopted amendments to the Law on Waste Management, which provide for the right of the Government to suspend the construction of cogeneration power-plants that had already begun, and also established a "quarantine" zone of 20 km from residential areas for the construction of such power plants.
Amendments to the law re-adopted by the Seimas will take effect from 1 January 2019. True, the rulers are already proposing to abandon the restriction of 20 km.
It is planned to consider this proposal at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, there are no plans to waive the Government's right to suspend projects that have already begun.
Kt will deal with this case in order - no earlier than a year later.
Exposed leBron James' questionable stats to the Lakers club
The beginning of LeBron James' career at the Los Angeles Lakers club is not what he himself, the organization and basketball fans expected.
The Lakers started the season with four wins and six defeats, and such a weak start helped spark rumours about the possible dismissal of coach Luke Walton.
Still, such talks were reassured by basketball operations president Magic Johnson, who said he wouldn't fire the coach, but he needed to play better.
The team's biggest star, L. James, should turn to himself as well.
Although the striker's stats are normally impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 assists.
But she doesn't tell the whole truth.
In the first ten games of the season, other figures have also come to the fore, showing that the Lakers are playing better when L. James is not on the field.
The striker is not favored by +/- stats that show how many more points the crew throws in or misses when there are certain players on the field.
That's when L. James is on the field, the Lakers have missed 30 points more than their opponents this season.
As he sat on the bench, the "hedgehogs" scored 19 points more than their opponents.
The Lakers are currently in just 13th place in the Western Conference, but a few victories could turn things upside down.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania greatly appreciates Spain's cooperation in NATO and its significant contribution to ensuring the security of our country and region," said Minister L. Linkevičius.
The Spanish Air Force has already carried out nato air police and air police strengthening missions in the Baltic States five times, including three times in Lithuania.
The last time the Spanish Eurofighter fighter jets were deployed in Šiauliai was in May-August of this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations are taking place between Lithuania and Spain on security, political, economic and strategic communication in the fight against propaganda.
L. Linkevičius expressed the hope that Lithuania and Spain will continue to work closely together on european, transatlantic agendas and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004, when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador Jose Maria Robles Fraga has been the fifth Spanish representative in Lithuania.
On October 29, Jose Maria Roblesas Fraga presented her credentials to President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
V. Ačienė on the arrest of R. Ačas: I believe in the innocence of a man and law enforcement
"For me, it was the most unexpected thing I could never think of.
On the other hand, probably, the services are doing the work that they are obliged to do.
We're all doing our job.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is right and honest, that no unfair actions on his part should be done," V. Ačienė told BNS.
R. Ačas was arrested by the Special Investigation Service (STT) on Monday - law enforcement suspects that he, while still the director of the raseiniai municipal administration, took a high-value bribe, and in return he may have created exclusive conditions for a private company that signed a contract with the municipally owned Raseiniai bus fleet.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of directly bribing R. Ace or participating in the masking of bribes in various financial transactions.
In April of this year, the Raseiniai district municipal council dismissed R. Ačas from the post of head of administration on the third attempt after a censure.
In March of this year, the former "usher" became a member of the newly founded Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party led by Gediminas Kirkilas, and on Monday suspended his membership of this party.
A few years ago, he unsuccessfully stood as a representative of the election committee "Tavo Raseiniai" in the mayoral elections.
V. Ačienė says that the man did not intend to put forward his candidacy in the Raseiniai mayoral elections next year, but had not yet decided whether he would participate in the municipal council elections.
V. Ačienė was elected to the Seimas with the list of the Lithuanian Union of Peasants and Greens, she is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
The politician says she will look forward to further law enforcement actions - it will depend on this whether she will recuse herself from working on the commission.
"I'm not really making any sudden decisions today, this week I think I'll make a decision.
I will see, if there is a need, what allegations have been made, I will naturally make a decision of one kind or another.
It's probably necessary for me to stay away from all the things that are being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again - everything will be put in place by time," she said.
Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė, a representative of the opposition conservatives in the Seimas, urged the Speaker of the Seimas Viktoras Pranckietis and the head of the "peasants" Ramūnas Karbauskis to distance themselves from the statements of the group's colleague Vida Ačienė and to withdraw her from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission by transferring her to work in another committee or commission of the Seimas.
She argues that the continued work of V. Ačienė in the Anti-Corruption Commission of the Seimas "would cause public mistrust and discredit the work of the important parliamentary supervisory commission".

Grybauskaite urges China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaite calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for investments by European Union (EU) countries, to facilitate the conditions for foreign imports.
Opening a trade and investment forum at the China Import Exhibition in Shanghai, D. Grybauskaite stressed that, seeing signs of economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be to "unite efforts to stop the spread of protectionism in the world", targeting the root causes of tensions caused by trade wars, "overproduction and unfair competition".
"China's commitment to creating a more attractive, open environment for investment is very important to the European Union - this is important when negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to complete this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign business feels welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property," said D. Grybauskaitė.
According to her, the opening of China is important not only for Europe, but also for this state, as well as for global economic growth.
The Lithuanian leader stressed that the transparency of investments must be "above the interests of any business group".
"Transparency, the rule of law, strict adherence to international treaties - this must be an essential thing for the environment of new investment relations," D. Grybauskaitė emphasized.
"Corrupt capital flows should not be expected in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries," she added.
China's import show is trying to defuse criticism that it avoids opening its market and protects only its own companies.
The exhibition is attended by the heads of several dozen states, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania.
According to the data of Statistics Lithuania, China currently ranks 25th among export partners.
Last year, Lithuania's exports to China grew by 50%, amounting to EUR 180 million. Euro.
At the same time, the volume of imports from China exceeded 820 million tons. Euro.
Some officials are worried that China's investments in Lithuania could bring unwanted political influence, and Beijing's exclusive attention to Eastern Europe is dividing the unity of the EU.

The cause of the lion air plane crash revealed: relatives of those killed are angry
Black box data from indonesia's crashed Lion Air liner shows that a speedometer malfunction occurred during at least its last four flights, investigators said Monday.
Soerjanto Tjahjono, chairman of the National Transport Security Committee (NTSC), said a similar bug occurred during the plane's last four flights, including the fateful one when the liner crashed in the Java Sea on October 29 immediately after taking off from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board were killed in this crash.
Many media outlets reported problems during the previous flight of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 plane from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, in fact, the technical problem was the speed in the air, in other words, the speed of the plane," Mr Tjahjono said during a press conference.
"The black box data showed that during the two flights before the Denpasar-Jakarta flight, there was also the same problem," he added.
"There are a lot of rumors circulating on social media.
Now we want to clarify that in the black box (data remained) about four flights during which there were problems with the air velocity meter," the NTSK chief said.
During a meeting with members of the families of the dead, Mr Tjahjono said the information from the device recording the flight data was in line with reports that its speed and altitude changed untidily as the plane took off on the last flight.
Search teams have yet to find a second black box recording conversations in the cockpit of pilots.
Lion Air indicated that when a technical failure was detected during the flight from Bali to Jakarta, it was repaired in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
One of the company's founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak with Transport Minister Budi Karyos Sumadi, who moderated a meeting of family members with officials overseeing the search for the remains of the plane and the victims and the investigation into the crash.
However, he stood up and bowed his head when angry and grieving family members demanded that Mr Kirana, who founded Lion Air with his brother Kusnan in 1999, introduce himself.
"Lion Air was misbehaving," said one man, who introduced himself as the father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island where the plane flew to.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he stressed.
- Since the beginning of the crisis, Lion Air has never contacted me.
We lost our child, but Lion Air didn't show us any compassion."
After this meeting, Mr Kirana hastily left, avoiding questions from reporters.
Many families are waiting for the results of a long process of identifying the dead.
Nearly 140 corpses, loaded parts of human remains, were handed over to police medical experts.
To date, only 14 victims have been identified.
Relatives questioned why the liner, which began to be used two months ago, was allowed to fly, although during the October 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta, a breakdown occurred, which, among other things, led to the sudden decline of the plane, which frightened passengers, immediately after takeoff.
Lion Air said the glitch had been fixed.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? - the son of one of the dead asked.
- If not, the technicians concerned must be held accountable.
The law is very clear, it was not they who said that the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must respond under the law so that plane crashes in Indonesia do not recur.
Mr Tjahjono said the large amount of small debris and the fact that the wreckage had spread over a relatively small area indicated that the liner was likely to smash into the water while flying at a very high speed.
"The plane was solid when it crashed into the sea.
It did not explode in the air, and the plane's engines, when it touched the water, acted at high revs - this is indicated by all the broken turbine blades," the official explained.
The crash of the Lion Air liner is the worst aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when a Garuda plane crashed near Medan killed 234 people.
After the accident, rescuers were leading from the wreckage: a minor was also hit
On Monday evening, on the road Vėžaičiai - Plungė, cars "BMW" and "Mercedes-Benz" collided near Tilvikai.
The cars collided in the forehead, three people were reported to have been injured.
The driver of the BMW, who was born in 1999, reportedly drove off to the opposite side of traffic and slammed into a Mercedes-Benz car with his forehead, which involved his dad, born in 1967, and his daughter, who was born in 2005.
The driver of the BMW was saved from the wreckage by firefighters - rescuers.
A girl from a Mercedes-Benz had her teeth knocked out in an accident.
All the victims were taken to the hospital.
Presidency: no artificial relief from the referendum is needed
After the Seimas approves the proposal of the rulers to lower the referendum bar for the currently more protected section of the Constitution, the president will veto the amendments, says her adviser Mindaugas Lingė.
"More than half of the population voted for the Constitution - that's the requirement.
This and its modification, especially the articles in its first section, should certainly be no less numerous .
It's easy to predict that the president would definitely veto," Dalia Grybauskaitė's domestic policy adviser told News Radio Tuesday.
He emphasized that the first section of the Constitution defines the fundamental subjects of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty, therefore, reducing the number of votes necessary to change these articles, according to M. Linge, would create a "negative precedent" and "open up uncontrollable risks".
"In the president's view, there is no need for any artificial facilitations, there is more need to prepare for the referendum itself, more dialogue with the people is needed," he said.
The Sejm is scheduled to vote on Tuesday to adopt an amendment to the Referendum Law.
It provides that a decision on amendments to the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution with higher protection shall be taken if at least two-fifths of the citizens with the right to vote agree in a referendum.
Currently, articles of the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution can be amended by referendum by more than half of all citizens with the right to vote.
Approximately 2.5 million people in Lithuania have the right to vote. citizens: half would be 1.25 million. of the electorate, two-fifths - a million voters.
This proposal was born after the Sejm in September approved the president's veto on amendments previously passed in parliament, which relaxed the requirements for the number of votes by changing Article 12 of the first section of the Constitution, which defines citizenship.
The bar for the referendum is proposed to be lowered in the run-up to the referendum on dual citizenship, which is expected to take place on May 12 and May 26 next year, when the first and second rounds of the presidential election are scheduled.
Those who emigrated after independence on March 11, 1990, cannot currently, with some exceptions, have no dual citizenship.
The Lithuanian community of the world aspires to dual citizenship, but there are fears that under the current conditions a referendum will not take place - a sufficient number of people would not come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports "strawberry", so they need to be renovated
The infrastructure of Lithuanian airports and roads is beginning to crumble, so it needs to be updated, says Minister of Transport Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renovation of Vilnius Airport is the minimum task that the state must perform.
"The air transport infrastructure is already crumbling as it was planned for lower passenger traffic.
We must renovate Vilnius Airport - this does not even fall under long-distance planning, this is the minimum that we must do," Mr. Masiulis said on Tuesday at the transport conference organized by the Foundation for the Development of Democracy and the magazine "State".
According to the Minister, the next decade will be extremely important, because important projects will have to be implemented - the construction of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica has been completed, Klaipeda Outer Port has been built, Vilnius and Kaunas airports have been renovated, and perhaps a new airport has been built.
"The next decade will be very important - we need to complete the integration of roads, railways, the construction of an external port in Klaipeda, clean up the airports, perhaps decide on the construction of a new airport.
We must not sleep, we must start projects right now that will reach our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years," the transport minister said.
Mr. Masiulis reiterated that too little money has been allocated to road maintenance in recent years.
"The condition of the roads is not improving yet because there is not enough funds.
We are able to build new roads, but even for the most necessary maintenance, for example, on trunk roads, there is a lack of funds.
We must determine the amount of how much should be spent on road maintenance if we want their condition to improve," Mr. Masiulis said.
He emphasized that exports of services in the Lithuanian transport sector grew by 18.6% this year, and the largest export market became Germany, ahead of Russia.
Mr Masiulis once again criticised the European Commission's proposal, according to which carriers from EU countries will be obliged to periodically return trucks to the country of registration.
"We must strive to make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, the suggestion that trucks should constantly return home is absurd, because in Europe empty trucks would run, burn fuel and increase emissions.
The railways will win the most out of this, as the costs will increase to such an extent that part of the transport will go to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions," Mr. Masiulis said.
According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, 12.2% is generated in the transport sector.
Lithuania's gross domestic product (GDP).
It has more than 118,000 employees and operates more than 7,500 companies.
Dispute with heritage conservationists
Last week, Mr. Masiulis announced in the Economic Committee of the Seimas that he had begun negotiations on changing the cultural purpose of the Vilnius Airport building, which would allow the demolition of the old terminal and the construction of a new one.
However, algimantas Degutis, interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD), p. Masiulis called the deliberations political pressure.
According to him, the building, built in the sixties of the last century, is a value that was entered in the register in 1993, and it is not for politicians, but for specialists, to decide on its removal.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that a modern arrival terminal would contribute to the improvement of Lithuania's image.
"It would be a politically important step to pull that old terminal out of the heritage, so that it could be demolished and a new modern arrival terminal could be built, so that when you arrive in Vilnius, you feel in a modern country, and not in such an interesting, really unrepresentative of our country as an innovative one," Mr. Masiulis said in the Seimas last week.
Mr. Masiulis also announced at the time that it was planned to build a completely new passenger terminal in Kaunas and connect the airport with the Rail Baltica gauge by building an underground station.
This transport hub is expected to operate in 2026, after the completion of the construction of Rail Baltica.
Last year, Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million passengers. people, 4.8 million people are expected this year. passengers, and next year - 5 million.
Last year, Kaunas Airport served a total of 1.2 million passengers. Passenger.

Minister of Finance on a possible crisis: it is important not to talk about the disease
"We always have to prepare for tougher times.
What I want to be glad about is that for the third year in a row, for the first time in the history of Lithuania, we are accumulating reserves.
But it's also a very important thing not to get sick," Mr Šapoka said during a visit to Brussels on Monday.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday, Miglė Tuskienė, Minister of Finance and Deputy Minister, participates in the meetings of the Eurogroup and the EU Council on Economic and Financial Affairs (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
The ECOFIN meeting discusses issues related to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU's single market, as some Member States have already adopted or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed that an agreement be reached on how to tax the revenues generated for the provision of certain digital services in EU Member States, as long as there is no consensus at global level.
The Eurogroup will provide an overview of the draft budgets submitted to the European Commission (EC) by euro area countries.
On 23 October, the EC rejected Italy's draft budget as not complying with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the EC has seized this opportunity for it.
For more information, please contact Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss the deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union: the feasibility of implementing the European deposit insurance scheme and the reforms of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role for the ESM in financial support programmes, but it is considered that the esm's functions need to be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of functions between the ESM and other EU institutions.

Traditions and customs of Lithuanian work
Recently, it was 120 years since the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural chronicler, ethnographer and regional researcher Balys Buračas (1897-1972) in Sidariai, Šiaulėnai county, then šiauliai governorate.
As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the State of Lithuania, we have a great opportunity to remember how the life-filled national revival called many Lithuanian people, including the Buračus brothers - Bali, Jonas, Broniai - from the very depths of the village to engage in the fostering, meaning and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balys Buračas, who has traveled around his native land with a camera in his hands for more than 50 years, presented a wide and realistic picture of the customs, traditions, folk art and material culture of our country.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing layers of national culture and had a rare ability to realize the enduring value of the work he was doing.
In the photographs of Balys Buračas, the Lithuanian landscape, mounds, everyday life and festive environments, our people, immortalized in national costumes, decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines with national costumes.
This publication contains a significant part of the legacy of Bali Burač, dedicated to the description of the national customs of labor and related traditions and, most importantly, their fascinating iconography.
The published material shows not only the peculiarity and beauty of those traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite two world wars and a difficult occupation.
The manuscript of the book is especially rich in descriptions written by Balys Buračas of interwar Samogitia, especially Kupiškėnai, Šiaulėnai, Telšiškės, as well as the inhabitants of Aukštaitija and Dzūkija, their holidays and other traditions and customs.
Of the approximately 10000 negatives stored in museums and archives, over 400 rare, mostly hitherto unpublished, photographs have been selected for this publication, which are grouped according to selected texts.
They reflect unique aspects of ethnic culture, which are characteristic of Kupiškėnai, Dzūkai, other districts of Aukštaitija and Žemaitija.

The tragic fate of the couple: killed after just a few hours of marriage
In the southwest of the U.S. state of Texas, a newlywed couple who had married just a few hours earlier were killed in a helicopter crash.
William Troy Byler, 24, and his co-wife, Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler, were killed Sunday shortly after midnight when a helicopter slammed into a hill 16 km northwest of Juwaldi and 129 km west of San Antonio, local peace judge Steven Kennedy said.
The strange thing is that the disaster occurred after flying about 24 kilometers, just as much as the newlyweds were years old.
Helicopter pilot Gerald Douglas Lawrence, 76, was also killed.
The newlyweds studied at Sam Houston State University, located in the city of Hantsville in the state of Texas.
They got married on Saturday evening at the Crayon family ranch near Juwaldi and flew out in a family-owned helicopter after a marriage celebration.
The disaster occurred after the helicopter flew about 24 kilometers.
The newlyweds flew to Sant Antony International Airport, where they intended to board a plane and fly honeymoon, Mr Kennedy said, without specifying the couple's final destination.
"It's a very rocky area of uneven terrain, and that hill is about 120-150 meters high," Mr Kennedy said.
G. D. Lawrence piloted the aircraft of that family for many years.
According to Mr Kennedy, he also piloted helicopters while serving in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, it should become clear what the physical condition of the pilot was and whether it could not become the cause of the disaster.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after takeoff.
His wreckage glowed in a wide radius on a rocky hillside, while the hull remained "dangerously suspended," flight safety investigator Craig Hatch of the National Transportation Security Board (NTSB) said during a press conference on Monday.
Investigators intend to take out the wreckage and then inspect it thoroughly, but it won't be easy for the tow truck and truck to reach the area, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been determined, and the preliminary report of the NTSB is expected to be published in two weeks.
Israeli prime minister calls the entry into force of new sanctions on Iran a "historic day"
"Today is a historic day," Mr Netanyahu told MPs of his party, Likud, his office reported.
"Today is the day when, under the leadership of President (Donald) Trump (Donald Trump), the U.S. is imposing extremely tough sanctions on Iran, the toughest sanctions on Iran in all that time efforts to curb its aggression began," the Israeli head of government said.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the new sanctions would deal a "decisive" blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls "the toughest sanctions of all time," came in the wake of Trump's May and controversial decision to withdraw from the world powers' deal with Tehran over its nuclear program.
The sanctions are aimed at significantly reducing Iranian oil exports, which have already fallen by about a million barrels a day since May, and to cut off Tehran from international financing.
Israel has long opposed the deal with Iran and says its scope and deadlines are too limited.
The Jewish state also says the lifting of sanctions has allowed Iran to fund militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighboring Syria and has vowed not to allow it to gain a military foothold there.
Other participants in the treaty with Iran - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - do not support the U.S. decision and say that the agreement, as intended, has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The court is once again looking at the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist
In the case of the accident that ended with the death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, in the Northern Town, the court will hear the testimony of a witness.
The Vilnius Regional Court ruled on Tuesday that one of the witnesses in the case will be heard at the next hearing on November 26 in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case.
An acquittal has already been handed down in this case, but the prosecutor's office disagrees with it.
On August 22, the Vilnius City District Court acquitted the driver of the car for the fatal accident of a motorcyclist, after 79-year-old Eduard Osipov announced that the motorcyclist was driving at high speeds in the city and committed a gross violation.
The Vilnius County Prosecutor's Office asks the district court to overturn the district court's verdict and argues that the biggest fault for the accident lies with E. Osipov, and the district court's conclusions are unfounded.
The lawyer for the family of the deceased rider is also asking for the acquittal to be overturned.
The accident occurred on August 11, 2015, around 3 p.m., when the Škoda Fabia car driven by E. Osipovas entered Žirmūnai Street from Lakūnai Street and collided with a motorcycle that was driving on the main road.
The prosecutor's office accused the man of violating the Road Traffic Rules, which provided for giving way, and causing a traffic accident - a man who was riding a Piaggo motorcycle on the main road was killed.
Initial police reports indicated that the scooter driver was killed, but later after investigations, it was found that the vehicle was equated to a motorcycle in terms of power.
Judge Rolandas Bužinskas of the Vilnius City District Court has told BNS that experts have found that the driver of the motorcycle was driving at a speed of 89.2 kilometers per hour, although the speed limit in that place is 50 kilometers per hour.
"The driver of the car could not have predicted that the motorcycle would be driving at such a high speed," the judge said.
At that time, the driver of the car of respectable age claimed to have been driving at a speed of just 5-6 kilometers per hour.
The rider of the motorcycle, who saw the obstacle, tried to brake and fell off the vehicle before colliding with the Škoda Fabia.
The prosecutor's office believes that E. Osipov, who drove from the side to the main road, should have given way to the rider.
Novaya Gazeta: Six Wagner mercenaries killed in Syria
Among the dead were five soldiers of the Syrian armed forces and six persons belonging to the military company Wagner.
This is announced by the Novaya Gazeta source in Syria.
According to the source, one of the units of the 5th Syrian Armed Forces Corps is stationed in the area, to which a number of Syrian volunteers and "military mercenaries" are also attached.
Novaya Gazeta sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a request for information about the fate of the Russians.
The former King of Belgium will have to take a paternity test
This decision is a partial victory for the artist Delphine Boel.
She has been seeking recognition as a child of a former monarch since 2013.
The 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II, had a short love affair decades ago.
The 84-year-old former king denies paternity.
According to the station's RTBF, he can go to the Supreme Court to oppose a DNA test.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boel - the ex-husband of Delphine's mother - is neither in the biological nor in the legal sense the artist's father.
Delphine applied for a corresponding investigation so that the daughter of "real" father Albert could be recognized.
The CEC will distribute money to the parties, but will not give anything to the social workers
The Central Election Commission (CEC) is set to distribute nearly $3 million to the largest political parties this week. A budget grant amounting to eur.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), headed by the Vice-Chairman of the Parliament Gediminas Kirkilas, established in the spring of this year, is not yet scheduled to allocate funds from the budget.
But they can be awarded in the near future by a separate decision of the CEC, if the legal environment governing the distribution of grants to parties changes.
Laura Matjošaityte, chairwoman of the CEC, informed the VŽ that "a meeting of the commission is scheduled for this Thursday, at which a decision on the allocation of the budget half-yearly grant to the parties is planned."
According to her, the CEC must take a decision on this issue by November 15.
It is planned to distribute $2.751 million to seven parties, six of which are parliamentary. Eur.
The opposition Patriotic Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats are expected to receive more than EUR 0.66 million. For the ruling Union of Peasants and Greens - about EUR 0.55 million. The opposition Social Democratic Party has about EUR 0.5 million in aid. The opposition Liberal Movement has almost EUR 0.4 million in aid. The Labour Party, which does not have its own faction in the Seimas, has about EUR 0.23 million. The Party of Order and Justice, which recently joined the ruling parties, has nearly EUR 0.22 million in aid. About EUR 0.18 million, represented in parliament but neither ruling nor opposition to the self-proclaimed Polish electoral campaign--the Union of Christian Families-the-the- Eur.
According to the current law, which will be followed by the CEC when distributing budget money, grants are awarded to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow only the LSDDP, which was established in the spring of this year, to expect to receive money from the budget.
Because this party has not yet participated in any of the elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that the social workers receive at least about a couple of hundred thousand euros in the run-up to as many as three elections next year - municipal, presidential and European Parliament.
The corresponding amendments to the political parties and this year's budget laws adopted by the Seimas were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Sejm has not yet decided on this veto, but the representatives of the ruling parties p. Kirkilas and the leader of the peasants-greens Ramūnas Karbauskis assure that parliamentarians will seek to reject the president's objections.
However, this will not be possible before this Thursday's CEC meeting, so, according to Mr. Matjošaitytes, "grants will be divided according to the legal order that has existed until now."
True, the head of the CEC did not rule out that if the Seimas rejects the president's veto this week or next week and the new amendments on the allocation of budget funds to parties take effect, the commission may consider a decision on the allocation of an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"When making a decision, we will take into account the entire existing legal environment, because we are the executive body that has to implement the laws that are being passed," she said.
If the Seimas were able to overturn the veto and the new laws came into force, they would allocate additional money to the parties by the Government, which additionally borrowed the appropriate amounts for this purpose.
The grants already allocated to seven parties would not suffer as a result of such a decision.

Poroshenko: the perpetrators of the murder of activist Handziuk must be punished
"I want to state that no version - and there are more than 20 of them today - will be rejected.
Each will be very carefully checked, adhering to the research procedures.
As president, I do not have the opportunity and do not have to obtain information that could undermine the course of the investigation.
However, the authorities are obliged to ensure transparency, and law enforcement agencies - to work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to find out the truth and punish evil," Poroshenko said at a meeting with young people on Tuesday in Kiev.
He stressed that he was most interested in having Mr Handziuk's murder uncovered and that the murderers, the organisers and the perpetrators of the crime "take the necessary responsibility".
"After this case has been reclassified as a murder (case), they are quite rightly and justifiably threatened with a life sentence," the Ukrainian president said.
He called the public's demand for an open and impartial investigation into the case correct.
Poroshenko stressed that the speeches of representatives of law enforcement agencies in parliament should show that "the authorities are determined to bring criminals and murderers to justice, whoever they may be."
He also said that political speculation on this topic will not help to clarify the situation, but will confuse everything even more.

Bill Gates introduced a waterless toilet
Introducing the futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the transition from traditional such devices to without plumbing with the computer revolution of the eighties of the last century.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates unveiled a high-tech toilet at an exhibition in Beijing that doesn't require water in plumbing pipes, Reuters reported.
The toilet without water works according to the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.

Now the device is complete and can be sold.
But in order for such toilets to be mass-produced, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another 200 million.

To combat the problems caused by poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, it increases the funds spent on health care, which already amount to 233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitation situation, which needs to be improved, Bill Gates to the toilet presentation a jar with faeces.

Some municipalities allowed the use of their premises, but not everywhere there were voting booths, because we cannot buy them ourselves.
Thank you to those who lent," the politician said.

"There were complaints.
Not all the people who took part in the elections had experienced it - for them, too, this was new.
So out of that inexperience, not all actions were in line with our orders.
It was therefore necessary to warn the CEC in order to comply with the principles described by us.
Those complaints, however, do not give reason to doubt the results," said A. Anušauskas.
According to the chairman of the CEC, there were cases when the ballot papers were not stamped - when they became aware of this, the ballot papers found in the ballot boxes without a seal were annulled.
In some towns there was a shortage of space, but, according to A. Anušauskas, complaints and violations relate to several dozen ballot papers.
"Well, since the difference is several thousand, this certainly does not make a fundamental difference in the results of the elections," explained A. Anušauskas.
The turnout of party members in the elections is said to have been 55 per cent, while the turnout of nonpartisan voters was 69 per cent.
Both candidates had 400 observers, and 600 people worked on commissions.

Plump girls break down stereotypes about wedding dresses
Plump girl in a white puffy bride's dress - mission (no) possible?
Can a white swan swimming towards the altar be larger than the size of an S or M and still look attractive?
The participants of the plus-size reality show "The Evolution of Size (r)" will already today prove that the beauty and elegance of the bride does not really depend on the kilograms of a woman.
But that's not all - one of the girls in the project will have tears of happiness tonight - her boyfriend will appear on the filming set.
"There are still those who think that larger girls don't get the attention or looks of guys.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend is an athlete himself, but he likes what I am, he does not require a figure that meets some standards from me," showrunner Aurika will speak in a wedding dress before the performance in a wedding dress.
The wedding dress is not light, in every sense, the garment - it is a complex construction, there is a lot of material in it, the dress is heavy, uncomfortable with movement.
Also, some women believe that a larger girl in a white dress will look even larger and therefore less confident.
I can reassure you that a properly selected model of the dress really solves this "problem", " explained one of the members of the show commission, fashion designer Robert Kalinkin.
R. Kalinkin decides the fate of the girls in the project together with the whole commission - Erika Vitulskiene, who opened a plus-size fashion house, photographer and social media star Naglis Bierranc and TV producer Laura Paukštė.
"When deciding which girl to say goodbye to the show, there are a lot of quarrels between the members of the commission - after all, we all represent different spheres and imagine the winner of the show differently.
The task of demonstrating wedding dresses was made even more difficult, and the fact - now I can already reveal - that two newcomers appeared, who were definitely not inferior to the old ones.
It was a special evening in every sense," says R. Kalinkin.
The newcomers - Eve, who became famous for her scandalous behavior at one summer reality show for her scandalous behavior at one summer reality show, and Dovilė, a 31-year-old mother of two children of exceptional beauty - like other girls, participated in the selection of "The Evolution of Size (r)" and entered the top twenty.

Actor I. Elba voted the sexiest man in the world
The US magazine People has named this year's sexiest man in the world.
It was 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba who became him.
Although the man claims that this news was unexpected, when telling about the new title, he did not lack wit.
I thought "It can't be!
Seriously?".
Then I looked at myself in the mirror and pondered - yes, today I look sexy, - the actor shared with a laugh.
Speaking frankly, Idris said this title, it's an extremely pleasant feeling that patted his ego.
The British star claims to have often received abusive words and bullying, which made his childhood difficult because, as he himself puts it, he was "very tall and clumsy".
The young actor did not please his peers and became the object of bullying also because of his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
"As soon as I grew my mustache and my muscles, I became the toughest guy in my city district," Idris smiles.
When a man doesn't have to be proud of the screens, Ms. Elba works as a disc jockey at parties held in Spain, and especially in the bustling Ibiza.
In his free time, a man enjoys Thai boxing and has a vein for fashion, which he realizes by creating his own clothing line.
The British actor assures that for him the most important thing in the world is family, so he is planning a wedding with his fiancée Sabrina Dhowre.
Ms. Elba became the 33rd voted the sexiest man in the world by People magazine.
In 2017, the title went to Blake Shelton.

The rulers no longer demand a distance of 20 km during the construction of waste incineration plants
Vilnius CHP plant is being built near Gariūnai market.
Those in power no longer seek to maintain a distance of 20 kilometers from settlements during the construction of waste incineration plants.
The head of the Environmental Protection Committee "peasant" Kęstutis Mažeika on Monday registered an amendment to the Law on Waste Management in the Seimas, which waives such a requirement.
According to p. The Mazeika, a faction of "peasants", which previously supported the provision for a distance of 20 km, promises to support the amendment on its refusal.
Mr. Mažeika's amendment provides that from January 2019, waste incineration plants could be built with statutory environmental protection and public health protection requirements.
He admits the amendments were prompted by the president's doubts about such a ban.
"Given the definition of a residential area, it is clear that such a place where the above objects could be built would be almost impossible to discover," the chairman of the committee states.
The ruling majority in October opposed the president's veto amendments tightening the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the ban on the construction of waste incineration plants closer than 20 km from the settlements, the amendments provided for a permit for the Government to make decisions on the future of the two power plants already under construction, taking into account the interests of public health.
The latter provisions p. Mazeika does not propose adjustment.
In Vilnius, the waste and biofuel-fired power plant is being built by the energy group Lietuvos Energija, and in Kaunas - together with fortum Heat Lietuva, the company of the Finnish energy concern Fortum.
The latter is already burning waste in Klaipeda.
Talk of a possible compromise in Brexit negotiations
British and Irish leaders on Monday discussed a possible compromise on the difficult northern Ireland issue that is stalling Brexit talks, Dublin reported.
Speaking by phone, British Prime Minister Theresa May suggested the possibility of revising the so-called hedge mechanism, which would allow the border to be left open between the British province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which belongs to the European Union.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has vowed to consider the proposal but has ruled out any possibility for Britain to unilaterally withdraw from the deal, a statement issued by the Irish government said.
In the interview, Mrs May "raised the possibility of revising the hedge mechanism", it said.
"Varadkar has made it clear that he is open to reviewing new proposals, provided that the result of such a review is not related to a unilateral decision to terminate the application of hedge measures," the government's statement said.
Brexit negotiators are not finding an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the uk-Ireland land border when Britain leaves the single market and customs union in March next year.
Both sides agree on "hedging measures" to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a larger-scale trade agreement is signed to ensure that no additional customs controls at the border are carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to apply temporarily to the whole of the United Kingdom.
The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is seeking to allow Britain to withdraw from the hedge deal unilaterally in three months.
But Mr Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "cannot support it".
"Three-month or limited-term hedges are not worth the paper on which they will be written," he stated.
Earlier, London and Brussels had not confirmed details of a breakthrough in Brexit talks following a announcement in Britain over the weekend that the deal was within arm's reach.
"I would say that we continue to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work to be done," Mrs May's spokesman in London said.
European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas also told reporters: "We are not there yet".
Nobel Prize winners call for access to reliable information
A group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel Prize winners, issued a declaration on Monday calling for the right to reliable information in the internet era.
Among the 25 individuals who signed the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Sen (Amartja Sen) and Joseph Stiglitz (Joseph Stiglic), Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi (Shirin Ebadi), as well as Nobel Prize winner in literature writer Mario Vargas Llosa (Mary Vargas Liosa).
"We call on goodwill leaders on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debates through which citizens can make decisions based on the facts," the group's statement said.
They argue that the "global space of information and communication" is a common good that "must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and opinion."
"People have a fundamental right to receive information that is freely collected, processed and disseminated, based on the principles of commitment to truth, pluralism of views and rational methods of fact-finding," the authors of the declaration added.
The document asks for help from world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump (Donald Trump), who often criticizes "fake news" but is regularly accused of distorting the facts.
World leaders are expected to take a stand on the issue when they gather for the "Peace Forum" in Paris on November 11-13, the signatories urged.
This declaration was drawn up within two months under the leadership of Sh. Ebadi and Christophe Deloire (Kristof Deluar), head of reporters without borders (RSF), a Paris-based organization for the protection of media freedom and journalists' rights.
Other signatories include former Senegalese President Abdou Diouf (Abdu Diuf), Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and political scientist Francis Fukuyama (Frensis Fukuyama).
The Seimas approved higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Law on Product Safety, which provide that fines for violations of product safety must be increased.
The amendments were approved unanimously in the Chamber.
As Antanas Vinkus, a member of the Seimas Committee on Health Affairs, said, with regard to the new project, it is to be welcomed that the goals set are related to better protection of consumers of products.
In addition, its provisions are adapted to the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"In my opinion, the proposed bill distributes more perfectly and specifically to all the executors involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current system of fines does not always prevent further violations, since the subjects who have paid fines continue to commit repeated violations," said A. Vinkus.
The draft was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, after the approval of the Government, the Economic Committee of the Seimas supplemented it with its proposals.
The amendments to the law are aimed at increasing fines for violations, strengthening the protection of consumer rights, empowering market surveillance authorities and creating a clear system of supervision of product safety requirements and compliance with them.
According to the Ministry of Economy, there is currently no obligation for producers to properly label a product and thus ensure its traceability.
In addition, according to the ministry, the state control of product safety by the market surveillance authorities did not give the right to enter the territory of manufacturers and suppliers, buildings, premises, to carry out inspections, which complicates the work of the authorities.
In the ministry's view, the six-month deadline for imposing fines and warnings is too short to identify the violation, conduct an investigation and impose a fine.
Also, according to the ministry, the fines imposed are not effective enough.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law - in 2017 alone, 14 companies did it.
The Ministry of Economy proposed to impose an obligation on manufacturers to properly label a product, thereby ensuring its traceability in order to make it easier for market surveillance authorities to identify suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to give market surveillance authorities the right, when carrying out state control of product safety, to enter the territory, buildings, premises of economic entities that produce, place products on the market, to carry out inspections.
It is intended to increase the amounts of fines for violations of the law.
A fine of between €150 and €2,500 (now between €144 and €1,448) would be imposed on the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who places dangerous products on the market and the distributor who has made them available on the market.
If the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (VVTAT) or another market surveillance authority decides to prohibit the placing on the market and placing on the market of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services, a fine of 1,000 to 5,000 (now from 868 to 4,344) euros would be imposed.
Failure to comply with the requirement to withdraw dangerous products from the market, to recall them from consumers and to destroy them would result in a fine of between EUR 2500 and EUR 6 500 (now between EUR 1 448 and EUR 5 792).
If dangerous products have caused harm to the health of the consumer, a fine of between EUR 2 500 and EUR 15 000 (now between EUR 1 448 and EUR 11584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused the death of a consumer, a fine of between €6,500 and €25,000 (now between €5,792 and €23,169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria, up to 25 thousand people are awarded for violating the legislation on product safety. a fine of euros (the minimum amount of the fine is not fixed), in Belgium - from 26 euros to 600 thousand. a fine of 155 euros in Romania - from 155 euros to a fine of 6 666 euros, in Bulgaria - from 125 euros to a fine of 7 500 euros.

The Norwegian Armed Battalion took part in NATO exercises in the most remote and harsh areas
Troops from the Norwegian Armed Forces took part in a series of complex exercises in the mountains located north of the country's capital, Oslo.
It is part of NATO's "Tee Bridge 2018" exercise, NATO's largest exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the troops from the second battalion of the Norwegian Armed Forces after the terrorist attacks of September 11 spent a lot of time away from home, in places such as Afghanistan - that is, in warm countries.
But most of all, they are skilled at war in the Arctic, and these skills of theirs are particularly useful now that NATO is changing the direction of its attention.
In recent days, in the mountains east of Tinset, often in the most remote and harsh areas, troops have taken part in staged battles against real British troops.
Soldiers have the skills to survive in this cold in the wild, but in a harsh climate they have to drag a much larger weight on their shoulders - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
The soldiers staying at the headquarters say they share their skills on how to survive and wage war in such conditions with other NATO soldiers.
According to the soldiers, these exercises, which, like no other, are very reminiscent of real warfare, will teach them to be ready in the event of a serious threat.

The Center for Eastern European Studies will work with two prominent U.S. "brain centers"
According to Lino Kojala, head of the RESC, who is based in Vilnius and has been counting for the thirteenth year of operation, the alignment in the USA will allow the implementation of projects and make the voice of Lithuania more audible on the other side of the Atlantic.
"We have been working in this direction for several months.
I am pleased that the two large institutions are seeing us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that there will be niches for action, because the topics of NATO, security, disinformation, development of the Eastern Partnership countries that we are analysing are also a priority for them," Kojala said.
The agreements note that the RESC and the US institutions will work together to prepare applications for international projects, exchange expertise and knowledge, and organise expert visits.
This should be especially useful for Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have an excellent international reputation.
FPRI has been operating since 1955 and unites almost a hundred top-notch analysts.
In the latest world ranking of analytical centers compiled by the University of Pennsylvania, FPRI ranked seventh in its category.

The Centre for Eastern European Studies operates on the basis of ongoing projects and is not maintained by targeted grants.
Among the partners of the RESC with whom joint initiatives are implemented are the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
