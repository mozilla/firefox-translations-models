Forest care official Mahavir Kaujlagi said that when the tigree was torn down the man in the fields late on Sunday, the villagers surrounded the beast and, as a female attempt to escape, he was on a tractor.

Propose for microchips and dogs to be labelled with microchips
The Chairman of the Committee on the Environment of the Seimas, K. Mažeika, together with other members of the Seimas, has registered amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Law, which offer cats and dogs to be marked with underon chemical microchips.
"We propose that cats and dogs be mandatory for subcutaneous microchips, and their registration and labelling should be organised by the local municipality, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In the year 2019, all dogs will be marked free of free of charge from the state funds, and in 2020 - cats will not be covered and the planned state funding will not cover the costs," said the Chairman of the Seimas Committee on the Environment, Kęstutis Mažeika.
The amendments to the law aim to solve the systemic need for pet marking.
This is expected to help prevent problems caused by irresponsible animal breeders, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is provisionally assessed that, according to the expected average cost of the microchip and the service, which will reach around EUR 5, will be reimbursed to all owners of the animals during the transitional period.
The total cost of marking pets can reach up to 6 million euros.
The demand for these funds is expected to be distributed over three years and will reach EUR 2 million annually.
It is planned that the funds for the programmes of marking the allocation of the municipal environment will be allocated through the special support programme of the protection of the municipal environment, which this year will increase significantly due to the redistribution of natural resources and the redistribution of funds.
These funds will be used by municipalities not only for the marking of cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programs.

In addition, EU legislation provides that only marked pets can be travelable.
At the same time, labelling obliges to take care of the animal responsibly throughout its life.
The previous proposals to mark mandatory resistance, as the programmes concerned were proposed to finance the funds of the population.
"The model currently presented in this criticism should avoid this criticism, because it is proposed to finance the protection of animals with increased income in the environmental welfare programme and to the right to be marked not only by veterinarians, but also by the public, who have listened to special courses at the Veterinary Academy," says the authors of the project.
The draft law has been registered by a group of members of the Seimas representing the different factions of the Seimas - K.S. Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

"Parliamentars note that, in the light of the fact, how the prohibition of the prohibition of the prohibition of the construction of the state of the waste management of the waste (i.e. the distance and the concept of the defined "resident" territory) is concluded that this prohibition is disproportionately limited or even refuted to carry out the economic activity related to the purpose of the incinement of waste, because the criteria were established in such a way that, when assessing the distribution of the Lithuanian population in the country, it would be impossible to construct such objects in the whole territory of the country," it added.

The cause of the disaster of the Lion Air plane revealed: the relatives of the dead were angry
The black box data from the crashed Indonesian airline Lion Air airline show that during the last four flights, the speed limit was in operation, the researchers said Monday.
The chairman of the National Transportation Security Committee (NTSK) Soerjanto Tjahjono said the similar crash occurred during the last four flights, including the fateful when a liner fell in the Sea of Java shortly after taking off from Jakarta on October 29.
All 189 people on board the plane were killed.
Many media reported problems during the previous Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, in fact, the technical problem was the speed of air, in other words, the speed of the plane," S told a news conference. by Tjahijon.
"The data in the black box showed that during the two flights before the flight Denpasar-Jakarta was also the same problem," he added.
"There are a lot of rumors on social media.
We now want to explain that in the black box (data remained) about four flights, during which there were problems with the speed air meter," the head of the NTSK said.
At a meeting with the members of the families of the dead, S. Tjahjoon said the information of the flight data-recording device that the flight rate was in line with the flight that its speed and height of the last flight had changed in a messy manner.
The search teams have not yet found the second black box, recording conversations in the pilots' cabin.
Lion Air indicated that it was adjusted by the manufacturer’s recommendations during a flight from Bali to Jakarta in the event of a technical failure.
One of the founders of the company, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak to the Minister of Transport and Communications Budi Karya Sumadi, a meeting of family members with officers, supervising the search for the plane and the victims’ remnants and the investigation of the disaster.
However, he stood up and bowed his head, when angry and cherished family members demanded that R. Kirana, who founded Lion Air in 1999 with her brother Kusnan, would introduce themselves.
Lion Air acted inappropriately," said a man who introduced himself as the father of the passenger Shandy Johan Raadhan, who was a prosecutor on the island on which he was on.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he said.
- Since the beginning of the crisis, Lion Air has never contacted me.
We lost our child, but Lion Air didn’t show us any compassion.”
After this meeting, R. Kirana went in a hurry, avoiding questions from journalists.
Many families are waiting for the results of the long recognition process for the dead.
Nearly 140 parts of the body bags loaded with the police medical medicine.
So far only 14 victims have been identified.
The relatives questioned why the ladner, who was launched two months ago, was allowed to fly, although during the flight from Bali to Jakarta on October 28, there was a failure, including by frightening passengers to the plane down after the takeoff.
Lion Air said the failure was removed.
Is it true that the problem was solved? - asked the son of one of the dead.
- If not, the technics concerned must be held liable.
The law is very clear, and they said that the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad techniques must be held accountable under the law, so that the plane crashes in Indonesia will not repeat itself.
S. Tjahjono said that the large amount of fine debris and the fact that the debris spread in a rather small area shows that the liner was likely crashing into the water by flying at a very high speed.
"The plane was united when it fell into the sea.
He did not exploep in the air, and the aircraft's engines, when it touched the water, acted in large turns - this is evidenced by all the blades of the broken turbine," the official explained.
The Lion Air liner crash is the biggest aviation crash in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people were killed when Garuda's Garuda plane crashed near Medan.
After the accident, the officers of the head of the wrereight: the minor suffered and

Presidential Palace: No artificial fainting for a referendum
After the Seimas approves the proposal of the ruling party to reduce the bar of a referendum to the current first section of the Constitution, the President will veto the amendments, says Mindaugas Lingė, her adviser.
"For the Constitution voted by more than half of the population - that is the requirement.
This and its amendment, in particular the articles contained in its first section, should certainly not be the smaller majority.
It is easy to predict that the president would really veto," Dalia Grybauskaitė's internal adviser told news radio on Tuesday.
He emphasized that the first chapter of the Constitution defines the fundamentals of the state - language, the flag, the territory, the capital, the sovereignty of the state, therefore, after reducing the number of votes necessary for these articles, according to M. Linge, a "negative precedent" would be created and "office the uncontrollable risk".
"In the President's opinion, there is no need for any artificial fathines, there is more need to prepare for the referendum itself, more dialogue with people," he said.
The Seimas is planning to vote on Tuesday on the adoption of the amendment to the Referendum Law.
It provides that a decision on amendments to the first and 14th section of the Constitution and the 14th section of the Constitution with higher protection shall be adopted if at least two fifths of the right of the election are in favour of the referendum.
More than half of all citizens with the right of vote may be replaced by a referendum on the first and 14th section of the Constitution.
Approuns 2.5 million citizens have the right to vote in Lithuania: half would be 1.25 million voters, and two fifths are one million voters.
This proposal was born after the Seimas approved the veto of the president on the previous amendments adopted by the Parliament, which reduced the requirements concerning the number of votes to change the citizenship of the Constitution, Article 12 of the first section of the Constitution.
The bare for the referendum is proposed to reduce the bitter as a result of the referendum on dual-litter, it should take place on May 12 and May 26th of the following year, when the first and second rounds of the presidential elections are planned.
The emigrants who have emigrated after the restoration of independence of independence on March 11, 1990, are not currently at present, with some exceptions, cannot have a dual citizenship.
The dual citizenship is aspiring to the Lithuanian community of the world, but fears that the referendum does not take place in the current conditions - a sufficient number of people would not come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian Airports "straška", so they need to be updated
The infrastructure of Lithuanian airports and road infrastructure is starting to be strawberry, therefore it is necessary to renew it, says the Minister of Transport and Communications Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renewal of Vilnius Airport is a minimum task that the state must perform.
"Air transport infrastructure is already a strawberry, because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renew Vilnius airport - this is not even not included in the far-eastic planning, that is, what we must do," the conference of the "State" magazine told the Conference of Transport and Communications held by the "State of the magazine". Masiulis.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be very important, because important projects will be implemented - the construction of "Via Baltica", "Rail Baltica", the external port of Klaipėda, the renewed airports of Vilnius and Kaunas, and perhaps a new airport will be built.
"The next decade will be very important - we have to finish the construction of roads, the railway, the construction of the external port in Klaipėda, to arrange the airports, maybe decide on the construction of the new airport.
We must not sleep, we must not go on, now start projects that will use our potential after 10, 20 or 30 years," the Minister said.
Mr. Masiulis reiterated that there has been too little money for car maintenance in recent years.
"The road condition is not improving yet, because the funds are not enough.
We are able to build new roads, but even for the most basic maintenance, such as highways, funds are lacking.
We must have to determine the amount of how much road maintenance should be used if we want them to improve," said the p. Masiulis.

Mr. Masiulis once again criticized the European Commission's proposal, according to which EU carriers will be obliged to periodically return the tolls to the country of registration.
"We must make sure that our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, the offer of trucks for a long time to return home is absurd, because in Europe there would be empty trucks, burned fuel, increase the discards.
Most of this, the railways will win, because the costs have increased to such an extent that part of the transport will move to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions," said Mr. Masiulis.
According to the data of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, 12.2% of the transport sector is generated.

"It would be a politically important step from the heritage to pull that old terminal, so that it could be to tear it down and build a new modern terminal of arrival, so that you will feel in a modern country, not such an interesting, certainly unrepresentative in our country as innovative," the Seimas said last week.

"Today is a historic day," said B. Netanyahu's members of the Likud party's parliament, his office said.
"Today is the day when President Donald Trump is putting in particular tough sanctions on Iran, the toughest sanctions on Iran during the time of efforts to cur curb his aggression," the Israeli prime minister said.
