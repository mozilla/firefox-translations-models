Ethics watchdogs: Liberal Movement Board on the action of Vilnius branch is right
The decisions taken by the management are in line with the statutes," its leader Vytautas Tamošiūnas told BNS after the commission meeting.
Our decision was not new.
We had already made the explanation as a commission in July, when the question of Pagėgiai and Utena arose.
Then we said that according to the statutes, this is a matter of the board's competence.
And if the board decides that some department can behave as it will be, go with the committee and the board approves it, then the department can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, which the board has taken, then there is a decision that all the sections would form party lists.
And if you do not agree with the board, then there is a possibility to suspend membership and go with the committee," he added.
According to V. Tamošiūnas, now the party's board will decide on further actions.
On October 17, the Liberal Movement Board of the party annulled the decision of the Vilnius City Branch to participate in municipal elections not with the list of the newly formed election committee.
According to the party’s board, the decision of the Liberals of the capital to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the articles of association of the party and the decisions of the board.
By October 31, the Vilnius branch had to cancel the aspirations to participate in municipal elections with the list of the committee.
But the department didn't.
The former head of the department, Aušrinė Armonaitė, has already resigned from the Liberal Movement.
The mayor of Vilnius, the former chairman of the Liberal Movement Remigijus Šimašius, who promises to run for another term of the head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee "For Vilnius, on which we are proud of!".
He also left the party.
Municipal councils and mayors will be held in March next year.
Residents of the village in northern India were carrying a tractor with a tiger that had previously torn one of the man, officials said Monday.
Forest care officer Mahavir Kaujlgi said that after a man working in the fields late Sunday was torn down, the villagers surrounded the beast and, as the female tried to escape, drove her a tractor.
Residents say the tiger also attacked and robbed a young man about 10 days ago.
The village is located in the Dudhva Tiger Reserve in the Lakhympur Kher district, about 250 kilometres southeast of the capital of Uttar Pradesh State, Laknau.
It is prohibited to act on tigers in protected areas.
Ramesh Pandey, director of the reserve, said the case would be reported to police under the Wildlife Conservation Act.
In April, villagers in the Naighasan district of Uttar Pradesh state beat another tiger, suffering serious injuries.
The tiger is an Indian national animal; according to the Wildlife Conservation Act, tigers are considered to be an endangered species.
Last year's government data showed that at least one person per person died every day in the previous three years of encounters with wild tigers or elephants.
Human conflicts with tigers have been gradually increasing since the 1970s, when India launched a tiger protection program that established reserves in national parks and the habit of large cats began to be considered a crime.
Although tiger calculation methods have changed, censuses would suggest that the then population of about 1 800 tigers increased to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
It is proposed to be mandatory for cats and dogs with microchips
Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection, together with other members of the Seimas, has registered amendments to the Law on Animal Welfare and Protection, which propose to mark cats and dogs with mandatory microchips.
We propose that cats and dogs must be labelled with subcutaneous microchips, and their registration and labelling will be organized by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be labelled free of charge with state funds, and in 2020, cats will not be worried and the costs will be covered by the specially provided state funding," said Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection.
The amendments to the law are aimed at resolving the systemic need for pet labelling.
It is expected that this will help to avoid the problems caused by irresponsible pet breeders, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is provisionally assessed that, according to the likely average cost of microchip and service, which will amount to about 5 euros, will be compensated during the transitional period for all the owners of the animals.
The total price of all pet labelling can reach up to 6 million euros.
It is planned that the need for these funds will be distributed over three years and will reach EUR 2 million annually.
It is planned that the allocation of the labelling programmes through the special programme for the protection of the municipal environment, the income of which this year will increase significantly due to the increased taxes and reallocation of funds of natural resources.
Municipalities will be able to use these funds not only for the marking of cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programmes.
According To K. Minority, compulsory labelling practices are widespread in almost all countries of the European Union, which allows the protection of the animals themselves (because lost can easily be returned to the owners), and saves the time of the livestock themselves, when it takes a lot of time and money to search for an escaped and lost pet.
In addition, EU legislation provides that only marked pets can be traveled.
At the same time, the marking obliges to take care of the animal responsibly throughout his life.
Previous proposals for mandatory labelling have faced opposition as the respective programmes were proposed to be financed with the funds of the population.
The model now presented should avoid this criticism, because it is proposed to finance animal protection with increased income in the environmental protection support programme and the right to label not only to veterinarians, but also to public figures, i.e. persons of animal care institutions who have undergone special courses at the Veterinary Academy," the authors of the project say.
The draft law was registered by a group of members of the Seimas representing different parliamentary groups - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

At first, the series "Women Lie Better", then the performance "Limer" and, finally, the comedy "Liars".
In this film Brigita plays the playful wife of Dainius Kazlauskas hero.
I really enjoyed filming in the Liars, because I'm more of a theater actress and rarely show up in the cinema.
The team of colleagues won a great result from the very beginning.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the court was the puppy Sunny!
All my life I thought that if I had a dog, it would be big and serious.
I never admired those small, decorative "fifs" four-legged.
But during the filming, Sunny was so attached to me that the sympathy became mutual and in the end I even wanted to buy it from the hostess, but unsuccessfully.
From the very first minutes, a new Lithuanian comedy "Languages" was introduced into the comedy and intriguing peripetia of the family members, which was produced by the producer of Lithuanian film hits "Inexperienced" and "Wish among us, boys..."

Before you can announce the "good news" for everyone, the parents unexpectedly declare - they are different!
After 50 years together...
And all this happens just before the most beautiful holidays of the year - St. Christmas!
But the end will surprise you even more, because no one expected such an atom.
All the heroes are not what they looked like at first glance...

Decide whether to write off 100 million euros in unpaid taxes
The Seimas on Tuesday adopted an amendment to the Law on Declaration of the Place of Residence prepared by the "Farmers" leader Ramūnas Karbauskis.
56 MPs voted in favour, 9 against and 25 abstained.
The Seimas will continue to consider the amendments on or after receiving the Government’s opinion on December 6.
R. According to Karbauskis, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the MP, in three years one person does not pay about 1 thousand euros, and now there are about 100 thousand such persons.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sysas regretted that in this way the Seimas would "urge some people not to comply with their obligations" - to declare the departure and then no taxes would be calculated.
Conservative member of the Committee on Health Affairs Antanas Matulas noted that Lithuanians living abroad use the fact that when paying a small health insurance tax, they come to Lithuania for treatment - they are provided with the same services as those paying this tax for the population.
The amendments provide that those who will pay social insurance contributions in the countries of the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation, and "Sodra" will be considered to be the persons who will leave Lithuania.
Mindaugas Sinkevičius, the head of "Sodra", has previously said that such a step will make it easier for both the life of the emigrants and the activities of "Sodra".
Online video about a slipper teddy bear reveals a serious problem
It is filmed how the mother climbs up the right snowy slope, and the baby keeps climbing, slipping down and rebuke again.
The video received a lot of reviews and comments.
People admired the perseverance of the little bear - repeatedly slipped down, he again climbed to his mother.
He fails the first time, but the little one does not even try to give up and finally achieves his goal.
The video is really attentive, but it also reveals the threat posed by humans to animals.
Scientists say that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people’s desire to know wildlife can sometimes be harmful.
"It's obvious to me that the bear drone was very frightening.
Their movements can see that they are panicing.
If the drones were not flying around, they would probably have chosen a safer way or more carefully.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used," ecologist Mark Dimmer told The Verge.
Some time ago M. Dimmer and his colleagues studied how drones act on the bear.
The animals were equipped with heart work gauges.
When the drone approached, some of them went to flee, others would not run anywhere, but all their hearts began to be beaten from fear more often.
Scientists advise to film drones for animals to use responsibly, not to fly too close, not to make noise and not to fly where it is prohibited.
The president went to the president during the newspaper
A Kiev court on Tuesday invited overthrown President Viktor Yanukovych to come to the case of a hearing of his alleged treason in an unusual way, announcing the summons in the official gazette of the state.
In the summons published in the government news newspaper "Uriadovo kurjer", the former leader is invited to appear at a criminal hearing on November 19 to hear his final arguments.

Restrictions on cogeneration power plants are appealed to the Constitutional Court
The Seimas opposition, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (CJ) to the ruling party’s decision to pass a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition faction of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) announced that a group of members of the Seimas had appealed to the Constitutional Court to investigate the constitutionality of the amendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by the ruling parties.
Parliamentarians underline that the provisions of the law are aimed at questioning the projects currently underway incineration plants, entrusting the Government with new restrictions (20 km of distance from the residential area) and the entry into force of the law for the construction of waste incineration plants in Vilnius and Kaunas," the statement said.
"Parliamentarians note that taking into account how the law formulates the prohibition to construct objects of waste management of the national significance (i.e. the distance is established and the concept of "living territory" is defined, it must be concluded that this prohibition is disproportionately limited or even negates the essence of the right to carry out economic activities related to the incineration of waste for the production of energy, because the established criteria are formulated in such a way that, having assessed the density of the population of Lithuania and the distribution of the country, it would be impossible to build such objects in the territory of the country.
The application states that the adopted law is not contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
The Commission has repeatedly stated that the legislation does not apply to those legal facts and consequences that arose before the entry into force of the newly adopted legal act.
In this case, the government is empowered to apply the law backwards in accordance with an indefinite criterion.
The establishment of such a legal regulation violated the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal certainty, and therefore the constitutional principle of the rule of law," the application said.
It also notes that large financial investments have already been made in the projects of Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration plants.
The suspension of the projects currently underway would cause the state not only one hundred million financial losses, and huge losses would also be incurred by Lithuanian residents - heating prices would increase, and environmental pollution would increase due to the growing amount of waste landfill.
The appeal to the Constitutional Court was signed by members from the Seimas TS-LKD, the Liberal Movement, the Social Democrat factions and the deputy head of the ruling Social Democrats Algirdas Butkevičius.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas managed to collect 71 votes to reject the amendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by President Dalia Grybauskaitė, which provide for the right of the Government to stop the construction of cogeneration plants already started, and set a zone of 20 km of "quarantine" zone for the construction of such power plants.
The amendments to the law, which have been repeatedly adopted by the Seimas, will come into force from 1 January 2019. However, the ruling party is already proposing to abandon the 20 km limit.
This proposal is planned to be discussed at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the government's right to suspend projects already started is not planned to be abandoned.
The Constitutional Court will deal with the order of this case - not earlier than a year.

V. Ačienė about R. Acho detention: I believe in the innocence of a man and law enforcement
It was the most unexpected thing I could never think of.
On the other hand, the services are probably doing the work they must do.
Everyone is doing our job.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is right and honest, that no unfair actions should be done," he told BNS. Ačienė.
R. Ača was detained by the Special Investigation Service (STT) on Monday, with law enforcement suspects that he, while still the director of the Raseiniai municipality administration, took a high-value bribe, and in return he was able to create exceptional conditions for a private company that signed the contract with the Raseiniai bus fleet managed by the municipality.

Sudden decisions I don't really do today, I think I'm going to make a decision this week.
I will see, if there is a need, what the accusations have been brought, of course, I will make a decision on one or another.
I probably need me to stay away from all the things that are being investigated in the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again, it will be time to put everything in its place," she said.
Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė, a spokeswoman for the opposition conservatives, called on the Speaker of the Seimas Viktoras Pranckietis and the head of the "Farmers" Ramūnas Karbauskis to distance himself from the statements of the group's colleague Vida Ačienė and to withdraw her from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission by moving to another Seimas committee or commission.
She says that further V. Ačienė’s work in the Anti-Corruption Commission of the Seimas “would cause a public-based mistrust and discredit the work of an important parliamentary supervisory commission”.

At the China China Import Exhibition in Shanghai, the Trade and Investment Forum D.

Lion Air plane crash caused: relatives of dead are angry
Data from the Indonesian airliner Lion Air plane's black box shows that at least four of its last flights there has been a speed meter malfunction, investigators said Monday.
Soerjanto Tjahjon, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Committee, said a similar incident occurred in the last four flights, including the fateful one, when the plane crashed in the Java Sea on October 29 shortly after taking off from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board were killed in the crash.
Many media outlets reported any inconvenience during a previous flight of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, in fact, the technical problem was the speed in the air, in other words, the speed of the plane," S told a news conference. Tjahjon.
Black box data showed that during two flights before the trip Denpasar-Jakarta was also the same problem," he added.
There are a lot of rumors on social media.
Now we want to clarify that there are four flights in the black box (retained) about four flights during which there were problems with the speed gauge," the head of the NTSK said.
During the meeting with the families of the dead S. Tjahjono said the information of the flight data-inventing device corresponded to reports that when the plane took off its last flight, its speed and altitude changed in a mess.
The search teams have not yet found a second black box that records conversations in the cockpit.
Lion Air said it had been repaired in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations on a flight from Bali to Jakarta.
One of the company's founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak to transport minister Budi Karya Sumadi, who moderated a meeting of family members with authorities overseeing the search for the plane and the remains of the victims and the crash investigation.
But he stood up and bowed his head when angry and grieving family members demanded that R. Kiran, who founded Lion Air in 1999 with her brother Kusnan, would introduce herself.
Lion Air did the wrong thing," said one man, who introduced himself as the father of passenger Shandy Johann Ramadhan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island where the plane was flying.
I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he said.
Since the beginning of the crisis, Lion Air has never been contacted.
We lost our child, but Lion Air didn’t show us any compassionate.
After this meeting R. Kiran was in a hurry to avoid the questions of journalists.
Many families are waiting for the results of the process of recognising the dead.
Nearly 140 corba bags loaded with human remains were handed over to police medical experts.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
Relatives questioned why the plane was allowed to fly two months ago, although a malfunction occurred during a October 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta, including a scaring off plane, causing passengers to be terrified by a sharp downturn shortly after takeoff.
Lion Air said the failure was eliminated.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? - asked the son of one of the dead.
If not, the equipment concerned must be held accountable.
The law is very clear, not they said that the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians are required to respond according to the law so that the plane crash in Indonesia does not happen again.
S. Tjahjono said a large amount of small debris and the fact that the debris spread in a relatively small area suggests that the liner was likely hit by flying into the water at a very high rate.
The plane was solid when it fell into the sea.
It didn't explode in the air, and the plane's engines, when it touched the water, acted in large rounds, as all the broken turbine blades showed," the official said.
The Lion Air plane crash is the worst air crash in Indonesia since Garuda crashed in 2009, killing 234 people.

Presidential Palace: No artificial relief is needed due to the referendum
After the Seimas approves the proposal of the ruling parties to reduce the referendum threshold for the first section of the Constitution, the president will veto the amendments, says its advisor Mindaugas Lingė.
More than half of the population voted in favour of the Constitution - this is the requirement.
This and its amendment, in particular the articles in its first section, should certainly be at least a majority.
It is not difficult to predict that the president would certainly veto," Dalia Grybauskaite's domestic adviser told Žinių Radijas on Tuesday.
He emphasized that the first section of the Constitution defines the fundamental subjects of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty, therefore, after reducing the necessary number of votes to replace these articles, according to M. Linges would create a "negative precedent" and "converted risks" to be opened.
In the president's opinion, there is no need for any artificial facilitation, there is a need to prepare for the referendum itself, more dialogue with the people is needed," he said.
The Seimas is planning to vote on the adoption of the amendment to the Referendum Law on Tuesday.
It provides that a decision on the amendments to the first and fourteenth section of the Constitution with higher protection shall be adopted if at least two-fifths of citizens with the right to vote are approved in the referendum.
Currently, more than half of all citizens with a right to vote may replace the articles of the first and fourteenth chapters of the Constitution by referendum.
Approximately 2.5 million citizens have the right to vote in Lithuania: half of the electorate would be 1.25 million voters, and two-fifths of the vote.
This proposal was born after the Seimas approved the president’s veto in September regarding the amendments previously adopted in the parliament, which relaxed the requirements for the number of votes in changing citizenship, which defines Article 12 of Section 12 of the Constitution.
The referendum is proposed to be reduced in a move to a referendum on dual citizenship, which is expected to take place on May 12 and May 26 next year, when the first and second rounds are planned for the presidential election.
Those who emigrated after the restoration of independence on March 11, 1990, currently, with some exceptions, cannot have dual citizenship.
The Lithuanian community of the world is seeking dual citizenship, but fears that the referendum would not take place under the current conditions - a sufficient number of people would not come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports "brashka", so they need to be updated
Lithuanian airports and road infrastructure are starting to crack, therefore, it needs to be renewed, says Minister of Transport and Communications Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renovation of Vilnius Airport is the minimum task that the state must perform.
Air transport infrastructure is already straw-scratching because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renew Vilnius Airport - it does not even fall into long-distance planning, it is the minimum that we must do," he told a conference on communications between the Foundation for Democracy and the State magazine on Tuesday. Masonry.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be very important, because important projects will have to be implemented - the construction of "Via Baltica", "Rail Baltica", the external port of Klaipėda is built, Vilnius and Kaunas Airports will be renewed, and perhaps a new airport has been built.
Next decade will be very important - we have to complete the integration of roads, railways, the construction of an external port in Klaipėda, to clean up the airports, maybe decide on the construction of the new airport.
We have to stay awake, we have to start projects that will use our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years," the Minister of Transport and Communications said.
Mr. Masiulis reiterated that there is too little money for road maintenance in recent years.
The condition of the roads is not improving yet, as the funds are not allocated enough.
We are able to build new roads, but even for basic maintenance, for example on highways, there is a lack of funds.
We must determine the amount of road maintenance should be allocated if we want their condition to improve," he said. Masonry.
He emphasized that exports of services in the Lithuanian transport sector grew by 18.6% this year, and the largest export market became Germany, which overtaking Russia.
Mr Masiulis once again criticized the European Commission's proposal, according to which EU carriers will have to periodically return trucks to the country of registration.
We must strive to make our exporters feel at home in Western Europe.
In my opinion, the proposal to truck to return home is absurd, because empty trucks would be driving in Europe, burning fuel, and excretion.
Railways will benefit most of it, as the costs will increase so much that part of the transport will pass to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions," he said. Masonry.
According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, the transport sector is created at 12.2%.
Lithuanian gross domestic product (GDP).
It employs more than 118,000 employees and more than 7,500 companies.
Dispute with heritage conservationists
Last week, p. Masiulis told the Seimas Economic Committee that he had started negotiations on the change of the cultural purpose of the Vilnius Airport building, which would allow to demolish the old terminal and build a new one.
However, the interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD) Algimantas Degutis p. Masiulis called the debated a political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the 1950s is a value, in 1993 it was entered in the register, and not politicians, and specialists must decide on its removal.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that the modern arrival terminal would contribute to the improvement of the image of Lithuania.
To pull out that old terminal from heritage would be a politically important step in order to deter it and build a new modern arrival terminal, so that if you come to Vilnius to feel in a modern country rather than such an interesting, truly unrepresenting our country as innovative," he said last week. Masonry.
Mr. Masiulis also announced that it is planned to build a completely new passenger terminal and connect the airport with the Rail Baltica track in Kaunas, building an underground station.
This transport hub should operate in 2026 after the construction of Rail Baltica.
Last year, Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million. 4.8 million passengers are expected this year and 5 million next year.
Last year, Kaunas Airport handled a total of 1.2 million passengers.

We always have to prepare for the harder times.

Tragic fate of a couple: dead after just a few hours of marriage
A helicopter crash was killed by a couple of newlyweds just hours earlier in a helicopter crash in the southwest of the US state.
William Troy Byler and his wife Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler, 24, were killed Sunday when a helicopter crashed into a hill 16 kilometers northwest of Junaud and 129 kilometers west of San Antonio, local peace referee Steven Kennedy said.
Surprisingly, the accident occurred about 24 kilometers, just as many as the newlyweds were in the age of the year.
The helicopter pilot, 76-year-old Gerald Douglas Lawrence, was also killed.
The newlyweds studied at Samos Houston State University, located in the Texas State city of Hantsville.
They got married on Saturday evening at the Byler family ranch near Juwaldi and flew a family-owned helicopter after the wedding celebration.
The accident occurred after the helicopter flew about 24 kilometers.
The newlyweds flew to Sant Antony International Airport, where they were going to board a plane and fly for a honeymoon, S said. Kennedy, without giving the final destination of the couple.
"It's a very rocky, uneven terrain area, and that hill is about 120-150 meters high," S said. Kennedy.
G. D. Lawrence piloted the family's aircraft for many years.
According to S. Kennedy, he piloted the helicopters and served in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, it should be clear what the physical condition of the pilot was and whether it could not have become the cause of the crash.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after the ascension.
His wreckage was wide-ranging on a rocky hillside and the body remained "dangerously hung", flight safety investigator Craig Hatch of the National Transportation Safety Board told a news conference on Monday.
Investigators are going to take the wreckage and then inspect them thoroughly, but it will not be easy for the truck and truck to reach the area, he said.
The cause of the crash has not yet been determined, and the preliminary NTSB report is expected to be published in two weeks.
Israeli PM calls new sanctions entry into Iran 'historical day'
Today is a historic day," B said. Netanyahu's members of his Likud party parliament, his office said.
Today is the day that under President Donald Trump imposes particularly tough sanctions on Iran, the US is imposing particularly severe sanctions on Iran, the harshest sanctions against Iran in all the time of attempts to curb his aggression," he said.
Earlier Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the new sanctions would result in a "decisive" blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measures Washington calls "the most stringent sanctions of all time" were introduced after D.C. Trump's May-controly decision to withdraw from a global power deal with Tehran over its nuclear program.
The sanctions are aimed at significantly reducing Iran's oil exports, which has already plunged about one million barrels a day since May, and cut Tehran off from international funding.
Israel has long opposed the deal with Iran and says its volume and deadlines are too limited.
The Jewish state also says lifting sanctions have enabled Iran to fund militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran’s actions in neighbouring Syria and has vowed to prevent it from gaining ground in a military manner.
Other parties to the deal with Iran - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - oppose the US decision, saying the deal, as planned, has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
Court re-exts the circumstances of the death of young motorcyclist
The death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, in the northern town of the end of the accident, the court will hear the testimony of the witness.
The Vilnius Regional Court ruled on Tuesday that one of the witnesses of the case would be heard at the next hearing on November 26 in order to find out all the relevant circumstances of the case.
An acquittal has already been issued in this case, but the prosecutor’s office disagrees with it.
On August 22, the Vilnius City District Court acquitted the driver of the car due to the crash of the crash, 79-year-old Eduardas Osipov, who declared that the motorcyclist was driving at high speed and committed a serious violation in the city.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor’s Office is asking the regional court to annul the verdict of the district court and says that E is the biggest fault of the accident. Osipov, and the findings of the district court are unfounded.
The lawyer of the family of the deceased motorcyclist is also asking for the annulment of the acquittal sentence.
The accident occurred around 15 p.m. on August 11, 2015. The Osipov-driven car "Škoda Fabia" drove into Žirmūnai street from Lakūnų street and collided with a motorcycle on the main road.
The prosecutor's office accused the man of the driver of the car had violated the Road Rules, which provided for the road to take the road, causing a traffic accident, killing the man who was driving the main road on the road, Piaggo.
Initial police reports indicate that the driver of the scooter was killed, but later after the investigations, it was found that the vehicle was assimilated to a motorcycle in terms of power.
Vilnius District Court judge Rolandas Bužinskas told BNS that experts found that the motorcyclist was driving at 89.2 kilometers per hour, although the speed limit is 50 kilometers per hour.
The driver of the car could not predict that the motorcycle would run at such high speed," the judge said.
At the time, the driver of the car of the elderly claimed to have been driving at a speed of just 5-6 kilometers per hour.
The driver of the motorcycle, who saw the obstacle, tried to brake and fell off the vehicle before colliding with the Škoda Fabia.
The prosecutor's office believes that E was driving from a side to the main road. Osipov had to give way to the motorcyclist.

The CEC will distribute money to parties, but will not give anything to the social workers
The Central Electoral Commission (CEC) plans to distribute almost 3 million to the largest political parties this week. A budget grant of the euro.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), headed by Deputy Speaker of the Parliament Gediminas Kirkilas, which was established this spring, is not yet available for funding from the budget.
But they may be awarded in the near future by a separate decision of the CEC if the legal environment regulating the distribution of grants to parties changes.
Laura Matjošaitytė, the chairwoman of the CEC, informed VŽ that "this Thursday is scheduled to meet the commission, where a decision is planned to be taken on the allocation of the budget half-yearly grant to the parties".
According to her, the CEC has to make a decision on this issue by 15 November.
It is planned to allocate 2.751 million to seven parties, six of which are parliamentary. Eur.
The opposition Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive more than 0.66 million. The euro, the ruling Farmers and Greens Union - about 0.55 million. The euro, the opposition Social Democratic Party - about 0.5 million. EUR, for the opposition Liberal Movement - almost 0.4 million. The euro, the Labour Party, which has no political group, is about 0.23 million euros. The EUR, which recently joined the ruling party, is almost EUR 0.22 million. The euro, represented in the parliament, for the Polish Electoral Action-Christian Families Union, neither the ruling nor the opposition, is about 0.18 million. Eur.
According to the current law, which will be guided by the CEC, when distributing budget money, grants are awarded to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes during the last elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow the LSDDP, established this spring, to expect to receive money from the budget.
This party has not yet participated in any elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that the Social Democrats receive at least a couple of hundred thousand euros in the run-up to three elections next year - the self-government, the president and the European Parliament.
The relevant amendments to the laws of the Political Parties and this year’s budget adopted by the Seimas were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but representatives of the ruling parties. Kirkilas and Farmers-Greens leader Ramūnas Karbauskis say that parliamentarians will seek to reject the president’s objections.
However, this will not have been done before this Thursday CEC meeting, therefore, according to p. Matjošaitytė, "the grant will be divided according to the legal order that has existed so far."
However, the head of the Central Electoral Commission did not rule out that if the Seimas rejected the president’s veto this week and the new amendment on the allocation of budget funds to the parties, the commission may consider a decision on the appointment of an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
When making a decision, we will take into account the entire current legal environment, because we are an executive body to enforce the laws that are in force," she said.
If the Seimas could reject the veto and the new laws enter into force, according to them, additional money would be allocated to the parties by the Government, which additionally borrowed the corresponding amounts for this.
Grants already distributed to seven parties would not be affected by such a decision.

I want to state that no version - and more than 20 of them today - will not be rejected.
Each will be very carefully checked, following the examination procedures.
As president, I do not have the opportunity and I do not have to get information that could undermine the course of the investigation.

Bill Gates unveils waterless toilet
Introducing the futuristic toilet, Bill Gates’ transition from traditional such devices to a water supply compared to the 2010 computer revolution of the 1970s.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates unveiled a high-tech toilet at Beijing that doesn’t need water in tapping pipes, Reuters reported.
The toilet without water works according to the principle of solid and liquid waste separation.

According to the Gates Foundation, 500 thousand children under the age of five die every year due to poor sanitation conditions in the world.
The fight against poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, raises funds spent on health care, which are already 233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitary situation, which needs to be improved, Bill Gates to the toilet presentation jar with faeces.
According to him, this is a good reminder that in a small example "there can be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria that cause infectious diseases, 100 thousand worm parasite eggs."

Can a white swan floating towards the altar be larger than S or M and still look attractive?

It's just a myth - my boyfriend is an athlete himself, but he likes who I am, he doesn't require a figure that meets any standards," Aurika, a show participant, will speak to the wedding dress before the show.
The wedding dress is not light, in every sense, the garment - it is a complex construction, it has a lot of material, the dress is heavy, uncomfortable for movement.

It was a special evening in every sense,” R. says. Kalinkin.
Newcomers - 23-year-old scandalous behavior in one summer reality show, Ieva and 31-year-old mother of exceptional beauty two children, Dovilė - like other girls participated in the selection of "Size (r) Evolution" and reached the top twenty.

The two sides agree to the "backstop" of "coastal measures" to maintain the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a larger trade agreement is signed to ensure that additional customs controls at the border are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to abide by EU customs rules, but London wants them to be applied temporarily to the whole of the United Kingdom.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is seeking Britain to leave the backstop deal unilaterally after three months.
However, L. Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government could "do not support it".
"The three-month or limited term of backshoes are not worth the paper on which will be written," he said.
Earlier, London and Brussels had not confirmed information on the breakthrough in Brexit talks after a statement in Britain over the weekend that the deal was within reach.
I would say that we continue to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work," she said. May's representative in London.
Margaritis Schinas, a spokesman for the European Commission, also told reporters: 'We're not there yet'.
Nobel Prize winners call for access to reliable information
A group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel laureates, issued a declaration on Monday calling for the right to be accessed in the online era.
Among the 25 people who signed the International Declaration on Information and Democracy include economists Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz, Iranian Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, as well as Nobel Prize laureate Mario Vargas Laosa.
We call on goodwill leaders to take action across continents to strengthen democratic patterns and open public debates through which citizens can make decisions based on facts," the group said in a statement.
They argue that the "global space of information and communication" is a common good that "must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and views."
"People have a fundamental right to receive information that is freely collected, processed and distributed, based on the truth of commitment, principles of plyuralism of views and rational methods of fact-finding," the authors added.
The document asks for help from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, who often criticized "faeat news" but regularly accused of distorting the facts.
World leaders should take a position on the issue as they gather for the "Peace Forum" in Paris on November 11-13, the signatories said.
This declaration was drawn up within two months under the guidance of Sh. Ebadi and Christophe Deloire, head of the Paris-based media freedom and rights group Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
Other signatories include former Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and political scientist Francis Fukuyama.
The Seimas Approves Higher Penalties for Harmful Products
The Seimas approved the amendments to the Law on Product Safety, which provide that fines for product safety violations must be increased.
The amendments were approved unanimously in the Chamber.
According to Antanas Vinkus, a member of the Seimas Committee on Health Affairs, when it comes to the new project, the objectives set are related to better consumer protection of products.
Its provisions are also adapted to the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
In my opinion, the proposed draft law provides a more perfect and more concrete distribution to all producers involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current system of fines does not always prevent further violations, as the entities that have paid fines continue to commit repeated violations," A said. Vinkus.
The draft was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, after the approval of the Government, the Seimas Economic Committee supplemented it with its proposals.
The amendments to the law aim to increase the fines for infringements, to strengthen the protection of consumer rights, to empower market surveillance authorities and to create a clear system for the maintenance of product safety requirements and compliance.
According to the Ministry of Economy, manufacturers are currently not obliged to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
In addition, according to the ministry, when public product safety controls carried out, market surveillance authorities were denied access to the territory of manufacturers and suppliers, buildings, premises, and inspections, which complicates the work of the authorities.
According to the Ministry, the set limit of six months for imposing fines and warnings is too short to establish the violation, to conduct an investigation and impose a fine.
Also, according to the ministry, the fines imposed are not sufficiently effective.
Businesses often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law - 14 companies did it in 2017 alone.
The Ministry of Economy has proposed to establish an obligation for manufacturers to properly label the product and to ensure its traceability in order to facilitate the clarification of suppliers of non-compliant products to market surveillance authorities.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities the right to carry out inspections of operators who produce, supply products to the territory, buildings, premises, and to carry out inspections when exercising state control of product safety.
It is intended to increase the amount of fines for violations of the law.
The manufacturer, the importer or authorised representative who has placed the market for dangerous products and the distributor, their making available on the market, the service provider providing dangerous services or providing the service, would be fined between EUR 150 and EUR 2 500 (now from 144 to 1,48).
If the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (VVTAT) or another market surveillance authority decides to prohibit the placing on the market of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services, a fine of between 1 000 and 5 000 euros (now from 868 to 4 344) euros would be imposed.
In the absence of the requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, to recall them from consumers and destroy them, a fine of between 2500 and EUR 6 500 (now from 1 448 to 5 792) euros would be imposed.
If dangerous products have caused harm to the consumer's health, a fine of between EUR 2 500 and EUR 15 000 (now 1 448 to 11584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused the death of the consumer, a fine of between EUR 6 500 and 25 000 (now from 5 792 to 23 169).
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria, a fine of up to 25 thousand euros is imposed for the violation of product safety legislation (the minimum amount of the fine is not established), in Belgium - a fine of between 26 euros and 600 thousand euros, in Romania - from 155 euros to 6 666 euros, in Bulgaria - from a fine of 125 euros to 7 500 euros.

Norwegian Armed Battalion Participated in NATO Exercises in the outermost and most severe areas
Soldiers from the Norwegian Armed Forces took part in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the country's capital Oslo.
This is part of NATO's "Tyrch Connection 2018" - the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the soldiers from the second Norwegian military battalion spent a lot of time away from home after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, in places like Afghanistan - that is, in warm lands.
But most of all they are skilled at war in Arctic conditions, and these skills are particularly useful now that NATO is changing its focus.
In recent days, in the mountains east of Tinset, often in the outermost and harshest areas, soldiers have been involved in staged battles against real British soldiers.
Soldiers have the skills to survive in this cold in the wild, but in the harsh climate they have to draw much more weight on their shoulders - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
Soldiers staying in the headquarters say that they share their skills on how to survive and fight under these conditions with other NATO troops.
According to the soldiers, the exercise, which, as no other, highly reminiscent of real warfare, will teach them to be prepared if there is a serious threat.
