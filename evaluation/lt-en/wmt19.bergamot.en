Ethics watchdogs: Liberal Movement Board is right for the act of the Vilnius branch
"The decisions taken by the Board comply with the statutes," its head Vytautas Tamošiūnas told BNS after the commission meeting.
“Our decision was not new.
We had already made an explanation as a commission in July when the question arose about Pagėgiai and Utena.
We then said that, according to the statutes, this is a matter of the competence of the board.
And if the board decides that any department can behave as it wants - to go with the committee and the board approves of this, then the department can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the board has taken, then there is a decision that all the sections would form party lists.
And if you do not agree with the board, then there is a possibility to suspend membership and go with the committee," he added.
According to V. Tamošiūnas, the party's board will now decide on further actions.
On October 17, the Board of the Liberal Movement of the party revoked the decision of the Vilnius City Division to participate in the municipal elections not with the list of the party, but with the newly formed electoral committee.
According to the party board, the decision of the liberals of the capital to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party’s statutes and decisions of the board.
By October 31, the Vilnius branch had to cancel its aspirations to participate in municipal elections with a committee list.
But the department didn't.
Former head of the department, Aušrinė Armonaitė, has already left the Liberal Movement.
Remigijus Šimašius, the mayor of Vilnius, former chairman of the Liberal Movement, who promises to seek another term of office of the head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee "For Vilnius, which we are proud of!".
He also left the party.
Municipal councils and mayoral elections will be held in March next year.
Residents of a village in northern India were riving a tractor-trailer that previously torn a man, officials said Monday.
Forest service officer Mahavir Kaujlagi said that after the tiger was torn in the fields late Sunday, the villagers surrounded the beast while they tried to escape and drove her by a tractor.
Residents say the tiger also attacked and mauled one young man about 10 days ago.
The village is located in the Dudhva tigers in the Lakhympur Khereri district, about 250 kilometers southeast of the Utar Pradesh state capital Laknau.
It is forbidden to use tigers in protected areas.
The director of the reserve, Ramesh Pandey, said the case would be reported to the police under the Wildlife Conservation Act.
In April, villagers in the Nighosan district of Uttar Pradesh state, beaten another tiger, who suffered serious injuries.
The Tiger is an Indian national animal; under the Wildlife Conservation Act, tigers are considered an endangered species.
Last year's government figures show that at least one person was killed every day in the previous three years in collisions with wild tigers or elephants.
Human conflict with tigers has been on the rise since the 1970s, when India launched a tiger protection programme that established reserves in national parks and the use of large cats began to be considered a crime.
While tiger counting methods have changed, censuses would suggest that the then population of about 1 800 tigers had grown to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
Proposed mandatory marking of cats and dogs with microchips
Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection, together with other members of the Seimas, has registered amendments to the Law on Animal Welfare and Protection, which propose to be mandatory labelling of cats and dogs with subcutaneous microchips.
"We propose that cats and dogs be mandatory to be labeled with subcutaneous microchips, and their registration and marking would be organized by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be marked with state funds free of charge, and in 2020, cats will also be marked, therefore, the residents will not be in trouble and the costs will be covered by the specially provided state funding," said Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection.
The amendments to the law are intended to address the systemic need for the labelling of pet animals.
It is hoped that this will help to avoid the problems caused by irresponsible pets, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is provisionally estimated that, according to the expected average price of the microchip and service, which will amount to about 5 euros, will be compensated for all animal owners during the transitional period.
The total cost of labelling for all pet animals can reach up to EUR 6 million.
It is planned that the need for these funds will be distributed over three years and will reach EUR 2 million annually.
It is planned that the funds for the labelling programmes will be allocated through the Special Programme for the Support for the Protection of the Environment of Municipalities, whose income will increase significantly this year due to increased taxes on natural resources and redistribution of funds.
Municipalities will be able to use these funds not only for the marking of cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programs.
According to K. The practice of small, compulsory labelling is widespread in almost all European Union countries, which allows to protect the animals themselves (because lost is easy to return to owners), and saves time for the pet owners themselves, when the search for a fugitive and lost pet has to spend a lot of time and money.
In addition, EU legislation provides that travel can only be made with labelled pets.
At the same time, labelling obliges to take care of the animal responsibly throughout its life.
Previous proposals were made to mandatory denial resistance, as the relevant programmes were offered for funding from the population.
"The model now should avoid this criticism, because it is proposed to finance the protection of animals with increased income in the Environmental Protection Support Programme and the right to be labelled not only to veterinarians, but also to publicists, i.e. persons of animal care institutions who have attended special courses at the Veterinary Academy," the authors of the project say.
The draft law was registered by a group of members of the Seimas representing different parliamentary groups - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

The team of colleagues, the assembled team from the very beginning promised a great result.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the court was the Sunny puppy!
All my life I thought that if I had a dog, it would certainly be big and serious.
I have never admired those small, decorative "fiffs" four-legged.
But during the filming, Sunny was so attached to me that sympathy became mutual and eventually I even wanted to buy it from the hostess, but unsuccessfully," the actress smiled.

Video about a slippery teddy bear on the Internet reveals a serious problem

Scientists say that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people’s desire to get to know the wildlife can sometimes be harmful.
“It’s clear to me that the bear drone was very frightened.
They can see from their movements that they are panic.
If a drone was not flowing around, they would likely have chosen a safer path or had overcome it more slowly or more carefully.
This is a great example of how drones shouldn't be used," ecologist Mark Ditmer told The Verge.
Some time ago M. Ditmer together with colleagues studied how drones affect bears.
The animals were fitted with heart machine counters.
When the drone came to pass, some bears would run away, others did not run anywhere, but the hearts of all of them from the fright began to beat more often.
Scientists advise drones to film animals to use them responsibly, do not fly too close, not to make noise and not to fly where it is forbidden.

Restrictions on cogeneration power plants complained to the Constitutional Court
The Seimas opposition, as promised, has appealed to the Constitutional Court to the ruling parties to adopt the law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the Seimas opposition group of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) announced that a group of members of the Seimas had appealed to the Constitutional Court to investigate the compliance of the amendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by the ruling parties with the Constitution.
"Parliamentarians emphasize that the provisions of the law are aimed at questioning the projects of waste incineration facilities that are already underway, entrusting the Government with new restrictions (20 km from the residential area) to the entry into force of the law on waste incineration plants in Vilnius and Kaunas," the statement said.
"Parliamentarians note that, in view of the way in which the law formulates the prohibition on the construction of objects of national importance for waste management (i.e. the distance is determined and the concept of "residential territory" is defined), it must be concluded that this prohibition is disproportionately limited or even denied the essence of the right to carry out economic activities related to the incineration of waste for energy production, because the criteria were formulated in such a way that, having assessed the density and distribution of the Lithuanian population in the country, it would be possible to build such objects in the country.
The application states that the adopted law is in conflict with the constitutional principle of a state under the rule of law.
"The Constitutional Court has repeatedly stated that the legislation does not apply to the legal facts that have occurred and resulted in the date of entry into force of the newly adopted act.
In this case, the Government is empowered to apply the law backwards, in accordance with an indefinite criterion.
The establishment of such a legal regulation violates the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal certainty, protection of legitimate expectations, and therefore the constitutional principle of the rule of law," the appeal states.
It also notes that significant financial investments have already been made in the projects of Vilnius and Kaunas CHP plants.
The suspension of the currently ongoing projects would result in the state not only of hundreds of millions of financial losses, and the residents of Lithuania would also suffer huge losses - heating prices would increase, and environmental pollution would increase due to the growing amount of waste disposal in landfills.
Members of the Seimas TS-LKD, Liberal Movement, Social Democratic Groups and Deputy Elder of the Social Democratic Labour Group Algirdas Butkevičius signed the application to the Constitutional Court.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas managed to cast 71 votes by the ruling votes to reject the amendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by President Dalia Grybauskaitė, which provide for the right of the Government to stop the construction of cogeneration plants that have already been started, and also set the zone of the "quarantine" of 20 km from residential areas for the construction of such power plants.
The amendments to the Law Repealed by the Seimas will come into force on 1 January 2019. However, the ruling parties are already proposing to abandon the 20 km restriction.
The proposal is scheduled to be discussed at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the government's right to suspend the already started projects is not planned to be abandoned.
The CT will deal with the case in a series of procedures - not earlier than a year later.

China's import exhibition is trying to soften criticism of avoiding opening up its market and only defending its businesses.
The exhibition is attended by heads of a dozen states, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania.
According to Statistics Lithuania, China is currently ranked 25th among export partners.
Last year, Lithuania’s exports to China grew by 50 per cent, which amounted to 180 million euros.
At the same time, the volume of imports from China exceeded 820 million euros.
Some officials are worried that China's investment in Lithuania could bring unwelcome political influence, and Beijing's special attention to Eastern Europe is dividing the unity of the EU.

Lion Air plane crash caused by deadly relatives angry
Figures from the crashed Indonesian airliner's Lion Air liner showed there was a speed camera malfunction in at least four of its last flights, investigators said Monday.
Soerjanto Tjahjono, chairman of the National Transport Safety Committee, said a similar incident occurred during the last four flights of the plane, including the fateful one when a plane crashed in the Sea of Java on October 29 shortly after taking off from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board were killed in the crash.
Many media outlets reported any majorities during the previous flight of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 plane from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, in reality, the technical problem was the speed in the air, in other words, the speed of the plane," S told a news conference. Tahjon.
"The data of the black box showed that during the two flights before the flight Denpasar-Jakarta was also the same problem," he added.
“There are many rumors on social media.
Now we want to explain that in the black box (data left) on four flights, during which there were problems with the speed camera in the air," the head of the NCK said.
Meeting with the family members of the dead S. Tahjono said the flight data recorder information corresponds to reports that when the plane took off its last flight, its speed and altitude did not change in order.
Search teams have not yet found a second black box that records conversations in the cockpit.
Lion Air said it was repaired in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations for a technical failure during a flight from Bali to Jakart.
Rusdi Kiran, co-founder, was not invited to speak to Minister of Transport and Communications Budi Karyos Sumadi, who moderated a meeting of family members with officials overseeing the search for the remains of the plane and the victims and the investigation into the crash.
But he stood up and bowed his head when angry and grieving family members demanded that R. Kirana, who co-founded Lion Air with her brother Kusnan in 1999, would introduce herself.
Lion Air was inappropriate," said a man who identified himself as the father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island on which the plane was carrying the plane.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he stressed.
Since the beginning of the crisis, Lion Air has never contacted me.
We lost our child, but Lion Air didn’t show us any compassion.”
After this meeting R. Kirana hastily left, avoiding questions from journalists.
Many families are waiting for the results of the long detection process of the dead.
Nearly 140 parts of corpses, loaded with human remains, have been handed over to police medical experts.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
Relatives questioned why the airliner, who was put into use two months ago, was allowed to fly, although a failure occurred during the October 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta, which resulted in a sudden drop in the plane that frightened passengers immediately after takeoff.
Lion Air said the fault had been eliminated.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? - the son of one of the dead asked.
- If not, the relevant technicians must be held accountable.
The law is very clear, it was not they who claimed that the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must respond by law to prevent the crashes of planes in Indonesia to stop repeating themselves.
S. Tjahjono said that a large amount of small debris and the fact that the debris is spreading in a relatively small area suggests that the plane was likely hit by flying into the water at a very high speed.
"The plane was solid when it fell into the sea.
It didn't explode in the air, and the plane's engines, when he touched the water, acted in large revs - this is evidenced by all the broken turbo blades," the official explained.
The crash of a Lion Air plane is the worst aviation crash in Indonesia since 1997, when Garuda's plane crashed near Medano, killing 234 people.
Rescuers rescued from the wreckage after the crash: a minor was also injured
On Monday evening, cars "BMW" and Mercedes-Benz collided on the road Vėžinai - Plungė, near Tilvikai.
The cars collided with a forehead, with three injured people reported.
The BMW driver, born in 1999, reportedly drove to the opposite side of the road and crashed into a Mercedes-Benz, which was born in 1967, and a daughter born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued from the debris by firefighters - rescuers.
The girl knocked out the teeth from the Mercedes-Benz during the accident.
All of the victims were taken to hospital.
Presidential Palace: No need for artificial easings on the referendum
After the Seimas approves the proposal of the ruling parties to reduce the referendum cartel for the first section of the Constitution currently having greater protection, the president will veto the amendments, says Mindaugas Lingė, its adviser.
"More than half of the population voted for the Constitution - that's the requirement.
This and its amendment, especially the articles in its first section, should certainly not be the lower majority.
It is easy to predict that the president would definitely veto," Dalia Grybauskaitė's domestic policy adviser told Žinių Radijas radio on Tuesday.
He emphasized that the first section of the Constitution defines the fundamental things of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty, therefore, by reducing the number of votes necessary to replace these articles, according to M. Leggings, would create a "negative precedent" and "open up uncontrollable risks."
"In the president's opinion, there is no need for any artificial facilitation, it is more necessary to prepare for the referendum itself, more dialogue with people is needed," he said.
The Seimas is scheduled to vote on Tuesday on the adoption of the amendment to the Law on Referendum.
It provides that a decision on the first and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution with higher protection shall be taken if at least two-fifths of the citizens entitled to vote are approved by the referendum.
Currently, more than half of all citizens with the right to vote can replace the articles of the first and fourteenth chapters of the Constitution by referendum.
Some 2.5 million citizens have the right to vote in Lithuania: half of them would be 1.25 million voters, two-fifths of a million voters.
The proposal was born after the Seimas approved the president's veto on the amendments previously adopted in parliament to ease the requirements for the number of votes in changing Article 12 of the First Section of the Constitution defining citizenship.
The referendum is proposed to be reduced by preparing for a referendum on dual citizenship, and is expected to take place on May 12 and May 26 next year, when the first and second rounds of presidential elections are planned.
Those who emigrated after the restoration of independence on March 11, 1990, are currently unable to have dual citizenship, with some exceptions.
The Lithuanian community seeks dual citizenship, but fears that under the current conditions the referendum would not take place - a sufficient number of people would not come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports "straw" are...
The infrastructure of Lithuanian airports and roads is starting to shine, therefore it is necessary to update it, says Rokas Masiulis, Minister of Transport and Communications.
According to him, the renovation of Vilnius Airport is a minimal task that the state must perform.
"The air transport infrastructure is already razing because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renovate Vilnius Airport, which does not even fall into the long-distance planning, this is a minimum of what we must do," the sub-settle said at the Transport Conference organised by the Democracy Development Fund and the magazine "Valstity" on Tuesday. Masiulis.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be very important, because important projects will have to be implemented - the construction of Via Baltica, "Rail Baltica", "Rail Baltica", Klaipeda external port was built, Vilnius and Kaunas airports have been renovated, and maybe a new airport has been built.
"The next decade will be very important - we have to complete the integration of roads, railways, the construction of an external port in Klaipėda, to clean up the airports, perhaps to decide on the construction of the new airport.
We have to sleep, to start projects that will use our potential after 10, 20 or 30 years," the transport minister said.
Mr. Masiulis reiterated that there has been too little funding for road maintenance in recent years.
"The condition of the roads is not improving yet, as the funds are not being allocated.
We are able to build new roads, but even for the most necessary maintenance, for example, on highways, there is a lack of funds.
We must determine the amount of how much should be allocated for road maintenance if we want their condition to improve," Mr. Masiulis.
He emphasized that exports of services in the Lithuanian transport sector grew by 18.6% this year, while Germany became the largest export market, which overtook Russia.
Mr. Masiulis once again criticised the European Commission's proposal, which would require EU country carriers to return trucks to the country of registration periodically.
“We must strive to make our exporters feel at home in Western Europe.
In my opinion, the proposal for trucks to keep coming home is absurd, because in Europe there would be empty trucks, burn fuel, increase emissions.
Most of this will be won by the railways, because the cost will increase so much that part of the transport will pass to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions," he said. Masiulis.
According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, 12.2% is created in the transport sector.
Lithuania's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
It employs more than 118,000 employees and operates more than 7,500 companies.
Dispute with heritage conservationists
Last week p. Masiulis announced in the Seimas Economic Committee that he had started negotiations on the change of cultural purpose of the Vilnius Airport building, which would allow to demolish the old terminal and build a new one.
However, the interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD) Algimantas Degutis p. Masiulis called the political pressure.
The building, built in the 1950s, is a value, entered in the register in 1993, and not politicians, and specialists have to decide on its removal.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that the modern arrival terminal would contribute to the improvement of the image of Lithuania.
"To pull that old terminal out of the heritage, it would be a politically important step in order to demolish it and build a new modern arrival terminal, so that when you arrive in Vilnius, feel in a modern country instead of such an interesting, truly unrepresentative of our country as innovative," the Seimas said last week. Masiulis.
Mr. Masiulis also reported that it was planned to build a completely new passenger terminal in Kaunas and to connect the airport with the Rail Baltica track by building an underground station.
This transport hub should operate in 2026 after the construction of Rail Baltica.
Last year, Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million. This year, 4.8 million passengers are expected this year, and next year - 5 million.
Last year, Kaunas Airport served a total of 1.2 million passengers.

This is the first time the Commission has taken advantage of this opportunity.
More information was requested from Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss the issues of deepening the Economic and Monetary Union: the possibility of implementing the European Deposit Insurance System and the reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).

Recently, it was 120 years since the birth of a famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural chronicler, ethnographer and ethnographer Balys Buračas (1897-1972), in Sidariai, Šiauliai parish, and the then Šiauliai governorate.
When we commemorate the 100th anniversary of the State of Lithuania, we have a great opportunity to remember how the national revival, which is filled with life, has called many people of Lithuania, including the brothers Buračai - Balys, Jonas, Bronius - from the very depth of the village, we can get involved in the fostering, meaning and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balys Buračas, having travelled around his native land with a camera in his hands for more than 50 years, presented a wide and realistic picture of our country’s customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing layers of national culture and had a rare ability to understand the enduring value of his work.
In the photographs of Bali Buračas, the Lithuanian landscape, mounds, our people, remembered in the environment of everyday life and holidays, decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines with national costumes.
This publication presents a significant part of the legacy of Bali Buračas dedicated to the description of the customs of national work and related traditions and, above all, their attractive iconography.
The published material shows not only the peculiarity and beauty of these traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the last century, despite two world wars and difficult occupation.
The manuscript of the book is very rich in the works of the residents of the interwar Samogitia, especially in Kupiškis, Šiauliai, Telšiai, as well as the residents of Aukštaitija and Dzūkija, their holidays and other traditions and customs written by Balys Buračas.
About 10000 negatives preserved in museums and archives were selected for this publication by more than 400 rare photographs, mostly unpublished, which are grouped according to selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture, characteristic of Kupiškės, Dzūkians, other districts of Aukštaitija and Žemaitija.

Tragic fate of the couple: killed after just a few hours of marriage
A newlywed couple who were just a few hours earlier, a newlywed couple who were just a few hours earlier were killed in a helicopter crash in the southwest of Texas.
William Troy Byler, 24, and his peer boyfriend Bailee Raye Raye Ackerman Byler, were killed on Sunday shortly after midnight on a hen, crashed into a hill 16 kilometres northwest of Juwald and 129 kilometres west of San Antonio, local peace judge Steven Kennedy said.
Surprisingly, the accident happened after about 24 kilometers, exactly as the newlyweds were a year.
Helicopter pilot, 76-year-old Gerald Douglas Lawrence, also died.
The newlyweds studied at Sam Houston State University, located in the Texas state city of Hantsville.
They married on Saturday night at the Zytters family ranch near Juvaldi and flew out of a family-owned helicopter after the wedding celebration.
The accident occurred when the helicopter flew about 24 kilometers.
The newlyweds flew to Sant Antonio International Airport, where they were going to board a plane and fly for a month of honey, S said. Kennedy, who did not specify the couple's final destination.
"It's a very rocky, unequal terrain area, and that hill is about 120-150 meters high," S said. Kennedy.
G. D. Lawrence has piloted the family's aircraft for years.
According to S. Kennedy, he was piloting helicopters and serving in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, it should be clear what the pilot's physical condition was and whether she could not be the cause of the crash.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after the take-off.
His debris has been seen in a wide radius on the rocky hillside, and the hull remained "dangerously hanging," flight safety investigator Craig Hatch of the National Transport Safety Board (NTSB) told a news conference on Monday.
The researchers are going to take out the debris and then inspect them thoroughly, but it will not be easy for the truck and truck to reach that place, he said.
The cause of the crash has not yet been determined, and the preliminary report of the NTSB should be published in two weeks.
Israeli PM calls new sanctions against Iran 'historic day'
"Today is a historic day," B said. Netanyahu to members of his parliamentary party, his office said.
"Today is the day when, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, the U.S. imposes particularly tough sanctions on Iran, the toughest sanctions on Iran throughout the time efforts to curb his aggression began," he said.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the new sanctions would be a "decisive" blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measures that Washington calls the "strongest sanctions of all time" began to be applied after D. Trump's May-rewacting and controversial decision to withdraw from the world's power agreement with Tehran over its nuclear program.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iranian oil exports, which have already slumped by about a million barrels a day since May, and cut off Tehran from international funding.
Israel has long opposed the deal with Iran, saying its scope and deadlines are too limited.
The Jewish state also says the lifting of sanctions has allowed Iran to fund militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighboring Syria and has vowed not to allow him to gain a military foothold there.
Other participants in the Iran deal - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - oppose the U.S. decision, and say the deal, as intended, has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
Court re-emerges the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist
The death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, in the North Town, the court will hear the testimony of the witness.
The Vilnius Regional Court ruled on Tuesday that in order to find out all the significant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses in the case will be questioned at the next hearing on November 26.

On August 22, the Vilnius City District Court acquitted the driver of the car, who, 79 years old, Eduard Osipov, had declared that a motorcyclist was driving at high speed and committed a gross violation.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor’s Office asks the regional court to overturn the verdict of the district court and states that the biggest fault of the accident is E. Osipov, and the findings of the district court are unfounded.
The lawyer of the family of the fatal motorcyclist also asks for the acquittal.
The accident took place on August 11, 2015, around 15 p.m., when E. The car "Škoda Fabia" driven by Osipov entered Žirmūnų street from Lakūnų street and collided with a motorcycle riding on the main road.
The prosecutor's office accused the man of violating the traffic rules of the road, which envisages the road and caused a traffic accident - a man riding on the main road on the Piaggo motorcycle was killed.
Initial police reports indicated that the driver of the scooter was killed, but later after the investigations, it was found that the vehicle was equated to a motorcycle by power.
Vilnius City District Court judge Rolandas Bužinskas told BNS that experts found that the driver of the motorcycle was travelling at a speed of 8.2 kilometers per hour, although the speed allowed at the point is 50 kilometers per hour.
"The driver of the car could not have foreseen that the motorcycle would be driving at such a high speed," the judge said.
At the time, the driver of the car claimed to have travelled at a speed of just 5-6 kilometers per hour.
The driver of the motorcycle, who saw the obstacle, tried to brake and fell from the vehicle before confronting the Škoda Fabia.
The prosecutor's office believes that E, which was driving from the side to the main road. Osipov had to give way to the motorcyclist.

The CEC will distribute money to the parties, but it will not give anything to the Social Workers
The Central Electoral Commission (CEC) is set to distribute almost 3 million to the largest political parties this week. A euro-reaching budget grant.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDP), headed by Vice-Chairman of Parliament Gediminas Kirkilas, established in spring this spring, is not yet scheduled to allocate funds from the budget.
However, they may be allocated already in the near future by a separate decision of the Central Electoral Commission, if the legal environment regulating the distribution of grants to parties changes.
Laura Matjošaitytė, the president of the Central Electoral Commission, informed that "this Thursday is scheduled to hold a meeting of the commission, where a decision on the budget half-yearly distribution to the parties is planned."
According to her, the CEC must take a decision on this issue by November 15.
Seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, are expected to be distributed to 2,751 million. EUR.
The opposition Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive more than 0.66 million. The euro, to the ruling Farmers and Greens Union - about 0.55 million. Euro, the opposition Social Democratic Party - about 0.5 million. Euro, for the opposition Liberal Movement - almost 0.4 million. The euro, the Labour Party, which does not have its own group in the Seimas, is about 0.23 million.

The euros represented in the parliament, but neither the ruling nor the opposition, the Electoral Action of the Electoral Action of the Christian Families Union - about 0.18 million. EUR.
Under the current law, which will be followed by the Central Electoral Commission when allocating budget money, grants are awarded to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of votes in the last elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow the LSDDP to expect to receive money from the budget established in spring this year.
The party has not yet participated in any election.
However, the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that the Social Workers receive at least a couple of hundred thousand euros in the run-up to three elections next year - the municipal, presidential and the European Parliament.
President Dalia Grybauskaitė, who was adopted by the Seimas, was vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but the representatives of the ruling parties have not yet decided. Kirkilas and the leader of the peasant-greens Ramūnas Karbauskis assure that the parliamentarians will seek to reject the president's objections.
However, this will not be done by this Thursday's meeting of the Central Electoral Commission, therefore, according to the point. Matjošaitytė, "dots will be divided according to the legal order that existed so far."
However, the head of the Central Electoral Commission did not rule out that if the Seimas rejected the veto of the president and the new amendment on the allocation of budget funds to the parties this week or next week, the decision on the appointment of an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP, may be considered in the commission.
"When making a decision, we will take into account the entire legal environment in force, because we are an executive body that has the implementation of the laws being adopted," she said.
If the Seimas were able to reject the veto and the new laws come into force, the Government would be separated by the government under which additionally borrowed the corresponding amounts.
Grants already allocated to seven parties would not be affected by such a decision.

"I want to state that no version - and today more than 20 of them - will be rejected.
Each will be very carefully checked in accordance with the examination procedures.
As a president, I don't have the opportunity and I don't have to get information that could undermine the course of the investigation.

Fuck girls break down stereotypes about wedding dresses
A plump girl with a white blown bridal dress - mission (not) possible?
Can a white swan sailing towards the altar be larger than the size of an S or M and still look attractive?
Plius-size reality show "Size (r) Evolution" will already today prove that the beauty and elegance of the bride really does not depend on the woman's kilograms.
But that's not all - one of the project girls will come to the tears of happiness tonight - her boyfriend will appear on the set of the filming.
"There are still those who think that the bigger girls don't get guys' attention or glances.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend is an athlete himself, but he likes me who I am, he doesn't demand a figure that meets some standards from me," Aukika, a participant of the show, will speak with the wedding dress before the show.
A wedding dress is not easy, in every sense, a garment - it is a complex construction, there is a lot of material in it, the dress is heavy, uncomfortable for movement.
Also, some women think that a larger girl in a white dress will look even larger and therefore less confident.
I can reassure you that the properly selected model of the dress really solves this "problem," explained one of the members of the show's commissioner, fashion designer Robert Kalinkin.
Destinies of girls in the project R. Kalinkinas decides together with the whole commission - Erika Vitulskienė, who opened a plus-size fashion house, photographer and social media star Nagliu Bierancu and TV producer Laura Paukštė.
"When deciding which girl has to say goodbye to the show, there are a lot of quarrels between the members of the commission - after all, we all represent different spheres and imagine the winner of the show differently.
The task of showing wedding dresses has yet to be complicated and this - now I can reveal - that two newcomers appeared, which were certainly not inferior to the old-timers.
It was a special night in every sense," R. says. Kalinkin.
Newcomers - 23 years old in a scandalous behavior in one summer reality show, Ieva and 31-year-old exceptionally beauty mother of two children Dovilė - like other girls participated in the selection of "Size (r) evolution" and got into the top twenty.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo shoot of girls in the streets of Vilnius, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girls were brought back to the show by the LNK viewers who voted for their favorites on the TV portal.
The international recognition of the reality show of the approtus beauties in Lithuania is taking place for the second week - here plus-size girls compete for the name of the first in the country plus the size of the star.
So far, there are only eight left - and they all know perfectly well that the winner will be only one.
The intriguing and unpredictable reality show "Size (R) Evolution" begins this Monday evening at 20:30 on LNK.

He admits that the amendments were prompted by the president's doubts about such a ban.
"Given the definition of the residential area, it is clear that it would be almost impossible to discover a place where the above-mentioned objects could be built," the committee chairman states.
In October, the ruling majority opposed the president's veto patch fixes tightening the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the ban on the construction of waste incineration plants closer than 20 km from settlements, the amendments provided for a permit for the Government to take decisions on the future of the two power plants already under construction, taking into account the public health interests.
Recent provisions p. Little is not proposing to adjust.
In Vilnius, the energy group "Lietuvos energija" is being built by the energy group "Lietuvos energija" and in Kaunas together with the Finnish energy concern Fortum "Fortum" company "Fortum" company "Fortum" company.
The latter is already burning waste in Klaipėda.
Talks of possible compromise in Brexit negotiations
British and Irish leaders discussed a possible compromise on Monday to address the difficult issue of Northern Ireland, which is stalling in Brexit negotiations, Dublin said.
Speaking by phone, British Prime Minister Theresa May proposed a review of the so-called Hedging Facility Agreement mechanism that would allow the open border between the UK's Northern Ireland province and the European Union's Irish Republic.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has vowed to consider the proposal, but has ruled out any possibility for Britain to unilaterally withdraw from the deal, the Irish government said in a statement.
In the conversation Th. May has "understood the possibility of reviewing the hedging facility," it said.
"Wradwar has made it clear that it is open to reviewing new proposals, subject to the condition that the result of such a review is not linked to a unilateral decision to terminate the hedging measures," the government said in a statement.
Brexit negotiators are not finding an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the UK-Irish land border when Britain leaves the single market and customs union in March next year.
Both sides agree on "insured measures" to maintain a border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland pending a larger trade agreement to ensure that additional customs checks at the border are closed.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants it to be temporarily applied to the entire UK.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is seeking Britain to withdraw from the Hedging Facility deal unilaterally after three months.
But L. Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "cannot support it."
"Three months or limited term insuring measures are not worth the paper on which they will be drawn," he declared.
Earlier, London and Brussels had not confirmed information about the breakthrough in Brexit talks following a report in Britain over the weekend that the deal was within reach.
"I would say that we continue to make progress in negotiations, but there is still work to be done," she said. May's representative in London.
European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas also told reporters: "We are not there yet."
Nobel Prize winners call for access to reliable information
A group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel laureates, issued a declaration on Monday calling for the right to get reliable information in the era of the internet.
Among the 25 individuals who signed the International Declaration on Information and Democracy include economists Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, as well as Nobel literature laureate writer Mario Vargas Llosa.
"We call on goodwill leaders to take action on all continents to strengthen democratic models and open public debates to allow citizens to make decisions based on the facts," the group said in a statement.
They argue that the "global space of information and communication" is a common good that "must be protected to strengthen freedom of expression and views."
"People have a fundamental right to receive information that is freely collected, processed and disseminated, based on the truth of the commitment, the principles of pluralism of attitudes and rational methods of fact-finding," the authors added.
The document asks for help from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, who often criticises "fat news" but regularly accused of distorting the facts.
World leaders are expected to express their position on the issue when they gather for the "Peace Forum" in Paris on November 11-13, the signatories called for.
This declaration was made within two months under the guidance of Sh. Ebadi and Christophe Deloire, head of Paris-based media freedom and journalists' rights campaign Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
Other signatories include former Senegalese President Abdou, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Bioo and political scientist Francis Fukuyama.
Seimas approves higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved the amendments to the Law on Product Safety, which provide that fines for violations of product safety must be increased.
The amendments were unanimously approved in the meeting room.
As Antanas Vinkus, a member of the Seimas Committee on Health Affairs, said, when it comes to the new draft, it is welcome that the objectives set are related to better protection of consumers of products.
In addition, its provisions shall be adapted to the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"In my opinion, the proposed draft law distributes more fully and specifically to all the executors involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current penal system does not always prevent further violations, because the entities that pay the fines continue to commit repeated violations," A. Vings.
The draft was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, after the approval of the Government, the Seimas Economics Committee supplemented it with its proposals.
The amendments to the law aim to increase fines for violations, strengthen the protection of consumer rights, to provide more powers to market surveillance authorities and to create a clear system of supervision of product safety requirements and compliance.
According to the Ministry of Economy, there is currently no obligation for manufacturers to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
In addition, according to the ministry, the market surveillance authorities did not grant the right to enter the territory of manufacturers and suppliers, buildings, premises, inspections, which complicates the work of the authorities.
According to the Ministry, the set six-month time limit for imposing fines and warnings is too short to establish the violation, conduct an investigation and impose a fine.
Also, according to the ministry, the imposed fines are not effective enough.
Businesses often repeatedly violate the law's demands - in 2017 alone, 14 companies have done so.
The Ministry of Economy proposed to establish the obligation for manufacturers to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability, so that it would be easier for market surveillance authorities to identify suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities the right to carry out checks on inspections by carrying out state product safety controls on operators who manufacture, place products on the market, the territory, buildings, premises.
It is intended to increase the amount of fines for violations of the law.
A manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who has placed on the market of dangerous products and the distributor who has supplied them to the market, who has supplied or provided hazardous services would be fined between EUR 150 and EUR 2 500 (now between 144 and 1 448).
If the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (VVTAT) or another market surveillance authority decides to prohibit the placing and placing on the market of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services, a fine of between EUR 1 000 and EUR 5 000 (now from 868 to 4 344) would be imposed.
Failure to comply with the requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, recover them from consumers and destroy them would result in a fine of between EUR 2500 and EUR 6 500 (now between 1 448 and 5 792).
If dangerous products have caused harm to the health of the consumer, between EUR 2 500 and 15 000 (now from 1 448 to 11584) would be fined.
If dangerous products caused the death of the consumer, a fine of between EUR 6 500 and 25 000 (now between 5 792 and 23 169) would be imposed.
According to the data of the Ministry, in Poland and Austria, a fine of up to EUR 25 000 is imposed for a violation of the legislation regulating product safety (the minimum amount of the fine has not been imposed), in Belgium - from 26 euros to 600 thousand euros fine, in Romania - from 155 euros to 6 666 euros, in Bulgaria - from 125 euros to 7 500 euros fine.

Norway's armed battalion takes place in NATO exercises in the outermost and harshest areas
Troops from the Norwegian Armed Forces took part in a series of complex exercises in the mountains located north of the country's capital Oslo.
It is part of NATO's "Trišmak's Connection 2018" - the largest NATO exercises since the end of the Cold War.
Most soldiers from the second Norwegian military battalion after the 9/11 terrorist attacks spent a lot of time away from home, in places like Afghanistan - that is, in warm lands.
But most of all, they are skilled at war in the Arctic, and these skills are very useful now that NATO is changing the direction of its attention.
In recent days, in the mountains east of Tinset, often in the most remote and harsh areas, troops have been involved in stage battles against real British troops.
Soldiers have the skills to survive in this cold in the wild, but in the harsh climate they have to put a much higher weight on their shoulders - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
Soldiers staying at the headquarters say they share their skills on how to survive and fight in such conditions, with other NATO troops.
According to the soldiers, these exercises, which like no other particularly resemble real warfare, will teach them to be prepared if they are seriously threatened.
