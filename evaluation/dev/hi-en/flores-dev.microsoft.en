People were hitting the glass with chairs, but the windows were not broken.
A glass from those mirrors finally broke, and they started to peep out of the window," said survivor Franciszek Koval.
When hydrogen atoms merge (or fusion) to form heavier elements, stars provide light and heat from the energy that is released.
Scientists are working to build reactors that can create energy in the same way.
This, however, is a very difficult problem to solve and will take many years before we can build useful fusion reactors.
Due to surface tension, a steel needle floats on the surface of the water.
Surface tension occurs because water particles on the surface of water are attracted to each other much faster than they are from air particles above water.
Water molecules create an invisible skin on the surface of the water due to which things like needles float above the water.
The blades on modern ice skates are two-sided and have a concave hollow shape between them. It maintains a better grip on the ice even when its two edges are bent.
Because the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, so that the blade bends on one side or the other and the edge that is in contact with the ice also bends.
This causes the skater to turn. If the skates bend to the right, the skater turns to the right, if the skates bend to the left, the skater turns left.
To get back to their previous energy levels, they have to get rid of the extra energy they got from light.
They do this by emitting a small particle of light called a photon". ”
Scientists call this process "stimulated emission of radiation" because atoms are excited by bright light, which emits photons of light and light is a kind of radiation.
The next photo shows the atoms emitting photons. Photons, of course, are actually much smaller than photos.
Photons are smaller than the matter that makes up the atom.
After working for hundreds of hours, the filament of the bulb burns and after that the light bulb does not work.
The light bulb needs to be replaced again. It is important to be careful in replacing the light bulb.
To correct the light, the switch must first be turned off or the cable should be disconnected.
If at that time you touch the inside of the socket or the metal base of the bulb, the metal part of the bulb can give you a severe electric shock, this is because electricity flows into the socket.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart which pumps blood.
Blood from the heart goes out of the tubes called arteries and comes back to the heart from the tubes which are called arteries. The thinnest duct is called the capillary.
The teeth of a triceratops were capable of crushing not only the leaves, but also very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that the tricertops ate cycads, a type of plant that was common in the Cretaceous.
These plants look like a small palm tree with pointed crowns, thorny leaves.
Dinosaurs of the species Triserratops could break their leaves and twigs apart with their powerful beaks before eating the tree trunks.
Other scientists argue that these plants are quite poisonous, so it is not possible for a dinosaur to eat them. Even though today other animals like sloths and parrots (descendants of dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
How will Io's gravity pull me? If you stand on the surface of Io, your weight will be less than the weight of earth.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth will weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on IO. So gravity undoubtedly shows less attraction on you.
The sun does not have a surface like earth on which you can stand. The whole sun is made up of gas, fire and plasma.
The gas becomes thinner as it moves away from the center of the sun.
The outer part that is visible when looking at the sun is called the panorama. It means, "Ball of Light".
About 3,000 years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that Venus has phases, just as the Moon has.
Due to the bright part of Venus (or moon) in front of the sun, the arts fluctuate. The Venus arts support Copernicus' theory that planets orbit the Sun.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed the transit of Venus.

There are many theories about the existence of Sanskrit. One of them is the theory of Aryans coming to India from the West that they brought their own language with them.
Sanskrit is an ancient language. It is similar to the Latin language spoken in Europe.
The world's first known book was written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of the Upanishads, Sanskrit faded only because of the hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, which has served to be the source for many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the source for European languages like French and Spanish.
Along with the Battle of France, Germany had started preparing to invade the island of Britain.
Germany named this attack "Operation Calien". Most of the British army lost heavy weapons and goods when it was evacuated from Dunkirk, so the army was quite weak.
But the Royal Navy was still stronger than the German Navy ("Kriegsmarine") and could destroy any invading navy sent into the English Channel.
However, very few Royal Navy ships were close to the possible escape route because the admiral feared they would be drowned in a German air strike.
Let's tell about Italy's plans. Italy was mainly the younger brother of Germany and Japan.
He had a weak army and a weak navy, although he built four new ships just before the start of the war.
Italy's main target was African countries. To capture those countries, they needed an army contingent that could cross the Mediterranean Sea and attack Africa.
For this, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. Apart from those tasks, the Italian warships had nothing else to do.
Now for Japan. Like Britain, Japan was an island country.
Submarines are ships designed to travel underwater and stay there for a long time.
Submarines were used in the First and Second World Wars. But then his speed was very slow and the shooting range was also very limited.
At the beginning of the war, they mostly traveled over the sea, but as radars developed and became more accurate, submarines were forced to go underwater to avoid sighting.
The Germans used to call submarines 'U-boats'. He was adept at operating his submarines and navigating them.
Due to their success with submarines, it is believed that the Germans will not have a greater number of them after the war.
Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as "King Tut" or "The Boy King", is one of the most ancient famous kings of modern Egypt.

Another famous Greek figure is mathematician Pythagoras, who is known for his theory on the sides of a right angled triangle.
The estimate of how many people speak Hindi is not certain. It is estimated to be among the second and fourth most spoken language in the world.
The number of people who speak the local language may vary depending on whether the respective dialects are counted very closely.
The number of speakers is estimated to range from 340 million to 500 million, while more than 800 million people can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu dictionaries are similar but their script is different; In everyday conversation, speakers of both languages can usually understand each other.
Around the 15th century, Northern Estonia was under the influence of Germany's great cultural heritage.
Some German monks want to bring God closer to the people, so they invented the Estonian literal language.
It was based on the German alphabet and added a letter "Õ/õ".
As time passed, many words that had been borrowed from German became included. This was the beginning of enlightenment.

Creating interactive media requires formal and traditional skills, as well as tools mastered in interactive classes (storyboarding, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design requires that you re-evaluate your beliefs about media production and learn to think in straightforward ways.
Interactive design requires that the components of the project connect to each other, but they also have meaning as a separate entity.
The drawback of zoom lenses is that the focal complexity and number of lenses required to achieve a range of focal lengths are much higher than those of prime lenses.
This problem is decreasing as lens manufacturers are achieving higher standards in lens production.
This has made it possible to capture higher quality images with zoom lenses than images obtained from fixed focal length lenses.
Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is generally low.
If there is no flash, this makes it difficult to use cheap zoom lenses in low light.
When attempting to convert a movie to DVD format, overscan is one of the most common problems.
Most televisions are made in such a way that they make common people happy.
For this reason, everything you see on TV has cut-off top, bottom, and right-left borders.
It is designed to ensure that the picture covers the entire screen. This is called an overscan.
Unfortunately, when you create a DVD, it's more likely that the boundaries will be cut, and if the subtitles in the video were also too close to the bottom, they won't be shown completely.
Traditional medieval castles have long inspired imagination, bringing to mind images of jathas, banquets, and Arthurian chivalry.
Standing amidst thousand-year-old ruins, it's easy to bring to mind the sound and scent of long-running battles, almost like hearing the crackling of hooves on coals and smelling the fear that rises from dungeon graves.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built? How were they designed and built?
By its time, Kirby Maxlow Fort is more of a fortified house than an actual fort.
Its large glazed windows and thin walls would not have been able to resist a long-term scheduled attack.
In 1480, when its construction was started by Lord Hastings, the country was relatively quiet. At the same time, the need for defense was only against small groups of nomadic miscreants.
The 'balance of power' was a kind of system. Under this arrangement, all European nations demanded to respect each other's national sovereignty.
The concept was that all European countries should prevent any one nation from becoming powerful, and so national governments frequently changed their alliances to maintain balance.
The War of the Spanish Succession was the first war whose basic issue was to establish a balance of power.
This led to a significant change, as European powers would no longer have excuses for religious wars. Thus, the Thirty Years' War would be the last war to be called a religious war.
The Temple of Artemis in Ephesus was built on July 21, 356 BC. It was destroyed in arson by Astostus.

The Indus Valley Civilization was a Bronze Age civilization in the northwest Indian subcontinent that included nearby modern-day Pakistan and parts of northwest India and northeast Afghanistan.
It is named after it due to the civilization that flourished in the ghats of the Indus River.
Although some scholars speculate that since the civilization existed in the valleys of the now dried up Saraswati River, it should be called the Indus-Saraswati civilization, while some call it the Harappan civilization since the first excavation of Harappa in the 1920s.
The Roman Empire's thought of militarism helped in the progress of medical development.
Emperor Augustus began recruiting doctors and even formed the first Roman Medical Corps for use in the aftermath of the battle.
The surgeons had knowledge of a variety of pain relievers, including morphine from poppy extract and scopalamine from henbane seed.
They had become skilled at amputation to protect patients from depression as well as turnkite and arterial tightening to prevent blood flow.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire made great gains in the field of medicine and much of what we know today has been discovered by them.
Pureland origami is origami with the restriction that it can only be folded once at a time, more complex folds such as reverse folds are not allowed, and all folds have direct locations.

It can be customized to make it easier to read and with as much or as little color as desired.
Attention deficit disorder is "a neurological syndrome whose three classic symptoms include impulsivity, distraction, and hyperactivity or overenergy.
It's not a learning disability, it's a learning disorder; It "affects 3 to 5 percent of children, possibly about 2 million American children".
Children with ADD have a hard time focusing on things like schooling, but they can focus on things they like, such as playing games or watching their favorite cartoons or writing sentences without punctuation.
These children get into a lot of trouble, because they do risky things to stimulate their minds, get involved in battles, and challenge authority, since their brains can't be stimulated in normal ways.
AD affects relationships with other peers because other children don't understand the way they act, why they do it or why they speak the way they speak, why they speak the way they do and their level of understanding is different.
As the ability to acquire and learn knowledge changed in the manner described above, the basic rate of acquiring knowledge also changed.
The approach to obtaining information was different. There was no personal pressure, but the ability to recall the text became greater.
In short, the Renaissance has led to a significant shift in the approach to learning and dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other male monkeys, orangutans no longer use their hands to walk or lift weights or swing from trees.
Chimpanzees' arms and legs are similar in size and length, indicating the use of the hand to carry loads in walking on the knees.
A man's hand with straight legs is smaller than his foot.
The bones of the fossil's hand, which are two million to three million years old, speak of the hand's expertise in transforming from locomotion to manipulation.
Some people believe that having many artificially induced lucid dreams can often be very tiring.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of pleasant dreams extending the time period between REM conditions.
With less REM every night, the state in which you experience real sleepiness and your body becomes abnormal enough to become a problem.
It's as exhausting as you wake up from sleep every twenty or thirty minutes and watch TV.
Its effect depends on how many times your brain attempts to dream clearly per night.

The game is played on grass, and the grass around the hole is kept small and called green.
Perhaps the most common tourism may be the one in which most people are interested in traveling to places of entertainment.
This happens when people go to a completely different place from everyday life for comfort and fun.
Beaches, theme parks and campgrounds are common places frequented by tourists seeking entertainment.
If the purpose of a person's visit to a particular place is to know its history and culture then this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different places in a particular country or they can focus on only one region.
Seeing this activity, the colonists also called for strength.
Soldiers who strengthened the front line included the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments of 200 soldiers led by Colonel John Stark and James Reed (both later becoming generals).
Stark's men took over the fence as well as the fence at the northern end of the colonists' position.
When a ditch formed on the Mystic River in the northeast of the peninsula due to the low flow of water, they quickly extended the fence northward from a small stone wall that ends on the small shore of the beach.
Gridley or Stark had placed a peg 100 feet (30 meters) in front of the fence and ordered that no one would fire until the soldiers left.
America's plan was to carry out joint attacks from three different places.
General John Cadvalder will launch an attention-grabbing attack against the British garrison in Bordentown to stop any of his reinforcements.
General James Ewing would take 700 militias across the river at Trenton Ferry, take over the bridge over Asunpink Creek and prevent any enemy troops from fleeing.
The main team of 2,400 people will cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and then split into two groups. After this, one group will go to Green and the other to Sullivan to attack before dawn.
With a shift from quarter to half-mile, speed becomes of little importance and stability becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, a first-class half-mile runner, a person who can take less than two minutes, should have a lot of speed, but all dangers require developing stamina.
Some of the cross-country races during winter have joined gyms to strengthen the upper body, which is the perfect preparation for the running season.
Proper nutritional intakes alone cannot generate elite performance, but they can significantly impact the overall health of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, creating effective hydration habits, and understanding the various aspects of supplementation can help athletes improve their performance and increase sports enjoyment.
Middistance running is a relatively cheap sport; However, there are many misconceptions about some parts of the equipment needed to participate.
Products can be purchased according to the need, but there will be no significant impact on the performance of most.
Players may find that they like a product more, while it also offers no real benefit.
The atom can be considered as a part of the basic blocks of the building of all elements.
According to a simplified Bohr model it is a very complex entity with a central nucleus orbiting by electrons, somewhat similar to planets orbiting the Sun - see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus is made up of two particles – neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electrical charge while neutrons have no charge. Electrons have a negative electrical charge.
To check on the victim, you should first check the site to ensure your safety.
You need to pay attention to the victim's condition and any danger marks as you approach him.
If you get hurt trying to help, you can only serve to make matters worse.
The study found that depression, fear and hallucinations mediated the relationship between pain and disability in people suffering from lower back pain.
Only the effects of destructiveness, not depression and fear, were on the condition of regular weekly structured PA sessions.
Those who are participating in regular activity need more support in the form of negative sensations of pain. This is so that they can distinguish between the intense pain and discomfort caused by normal physical movements.
Vision or vision ability depends on the visual system, sensory organs or eyes.
There are many different compositions of the eyes, which are in complexity depending on the needs of the organism.
Different constructions have different capabilities, are sensitive to different wave-lengths and have different degrees of acuity, plus they require different processing for the understanding of the input and different numbers to work optimally.
A population is a group of organisms of a particular species within a given geographical area.
When all the individuals in a population are similar with respect to a particular phenotypic trait, they are known as monomorphic.
When a person shows multiple variations of an attribute, it is polymorphic.
Soldier ants form colonies and houses by walking in a queue at different stages.
In the nomadic phase, the herd of ants march at night and stop at the tent during the day.
When the food runs out of water, the settlement starts the Banjara phase. In this stage the settlement creates temporary nests that are changed daily.
Each of these nomadic stampedes or marches lasts about 17 days.
What is a Cell? The word cell comes from the Latin word "cella", meaning "small room", and was first discovered by a microscopist who was observing the structure of the cork.
The cell is the basic unit of all living things, and all organisms are made up of one or more cells.
Cells are so basic and important to the study of life that in fact they are often referred to as the "building blocks of life."
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses through the body so that the flow as well as blood remains unobstructed.
These nerve impulses can be sent throughout the body so quickly which helps to keep the body safe from any happening danger.
Tornadoes strike a smaller area than other fierce storms, but they can destroy everything in their path.
Tornadoes uproot trees, uproot boards from buildings, and blow cars into the sky. The most violent two percent of tornadoes persist for more than three hours.
These dangerous storms have winds of up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300mph).
Humans have been making and using lenses for magnification for thousands and thousands of years.
However, the first real telescope was built in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear both near and large.
Greed and selfishness will always be with us and it is the nature of cooperation that when there is a majority benefit, always working selfishly will bring more benefits in the short term.
Hopefully most people will realize that working together with others is their long-term best option.
Many people dream of the day when humans will be able to travel to another star and explore another world, some people think what might happen there while some others believe that there may be aliens or other creatures on other planets.
But, if it ever happens it probably won't be for very long. The stars are so dispersed that there are trillions of miles between the "neighboring" stars.
Perhaps one day, your great-grandchildren or great-grandchildren will be standing in a very different world and thinking about their ancestors?
Animals are made up of many cells. They eat the things they eat and digest them inside. Most animals can walk.
Only animals have brains (although not all animals have; jellyfish, for example, do not have brains).
Animals are found all over the world. They live on land, swim in the seas and fly in the sky.
A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of a living organism.
Cell comes from the Latin word cella which means small room.
If you look at living things out of a microscope, you will see that they are made up of small squares or balls.
England biologist Robert Hooke looked at small squares in cork with a microscope.
They (cells) looked like rooms. He (Robert Hooke) was the first person to inspect dead cells.
Elements and compounds can change from one state to another and will not change.
Nitrogen as a gas has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is denser but the molecules are still the same.
Water is another example. The compound is composed of two molecules of water hydrogen and one molecule of oxygen.
It has the same molecular structure whether it is gas, liquid or solid.
Although its physical state may change, its chemical state remains the same.
Time is something around us, and affects everything we do, yet it's hard to understand.
Time has been studied by religious, philosophical and scientific scholars for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events moving from the future to the present to the past.
Time is also how we compare the duration (length) of events.
You can mark a change in time by observing the repetition of cyclical events. A cyclic phenomenon is something that happens regularly and repeatedly.
Nowadays computers are used to manipulate photos and videos.
Artificial animations can be created on computers and such animations are being used in television and films.
Music is recorded using sophisticated computers to process and mix sound together.
For a long time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Māori people, who hunted the giant bird called moss.
The theory then established the idea that the Māori people moved from Polynesia to a Great Fleet and moved New Zealand from Moriori, establishing an agricultural society.
However, new evidence suggests that the Moriori were a group of mainland Māori people who migrated from New Zealand to Chatham Island to develop their distinctive, peaceful culture.
There was another tribe present on the Chatham Islands and these were the people of the Māori tribe who came from New Zealand.
He called himself Moriori, then there were some clashes but in the end Mori Ori was eliminated
Individuals involved for many decades helped us appreciate our strengths and passion while openly evaluating difficulties and even failures.
By sharing their personal, family, and organizational stories while listening to individuals, we gained important insights in the past and about certain personalities who influenced the organization's culture, good or bad.
While understanding one's history is not supposed to be understanding culture, it does help people at least understand where they are in the organization's history.
By evaluating successes and knowing failures, the participant gets to know not only individually but also his or her entire personality, values, mission and the driving force that drives the organization.
In this instance, the memories and successes of the previous example of entrepreneurial behavior helped people open the local church with new changes and instructions.
Such success stories reduced the fears of change, creating a positive inclination towards change in the future.
Inclusive thinking pattern is a problem solving technique that unites different ideas or fields to find a solution.
The goal of this mindset is speed, reasoning and accuracy, identifying facts, reapplying existing technologies and gathering information.
The most important factor of this mindset is: there is only one correct answer. You only think of two answers – right or wrong.
This kind of thinking is associated with specific science or standard methods.
People with this kind of thinking have logical thinking, who are able to remember patterns, solve problems and work on scientific tests.
The human species is by far the most talented species to read the minds of others.
This means that we are able to successfully predict the understanding, intention, belief, experience or desire of other human beings.
Despite these abilities, it is important to understand the intention of others. This enables us to resolve the possible ambiguities of bodily actions.
For example, if you see someone breaking a car window, you'll probably understand that he's trying to steal a stranger's car.
If he lost his car key and was attempting to break open his own car, he should be judged differently.
MRI is based on a physics phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (Harvard University).
In this resonance, magnetic fields and radio waves cause atoms to release small radio signals.
In 1970, medical doctor and research scientist Raymond DeMedian discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a tool for medical diagnosis.
Four years later, a patent was granted. It was the world's first patent issued in the field of MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Demedien first built the structure of a "full-body" MRI scanner, which he named "indomitable".
Asynchronous communication promotes time for reflection and feedback of others.
It allows students to work at their own pace and control the speed of training information.
In addition, punctuality is low and working hours can be changed according to your choice. (Bremer, 1998)
The use of the Internet and the World Wide Web allows learners to get information at all times.
Students can send questions to the teacher anytime during the day and get a quick answer to their question at any time instead of waiting till the next face-to-face meeting.
Postmodern access to learning provides liberation from the ultimate elements. There is no better way to learn than this.
In fact, there is not a single good thing to learn, learning is from the experience between the learner and the provider of knowledge.
All our recent experience with self-help and information presentation based television shows based on learning reflect this.
Many of us find ourselves watching a television show that exposes us to a process or experience in which we will never participate or apply that knowledge.
We would never do a full investigation and repair of the car, build a fountain in our back yard, travel to Peru to see ancient ruins, or remodel our neighbor's house.
Thanks to an undersea fiber optic cable link and broadband satellite to Europe, Greenland is well connected to the Internet with 93% of the population.
Your hotel or host (if you're staying at a guest house or someone's home) may have a computer with WiFi or an Internet connection, and you'll have internet cafes or public Wi-Fi all over the place.
As mentioned above, although the term "eskimo" is acceptable in the United States, it is considered offensive by many non-American Arctic people, especially in Canada.
While you can hear the term used by Greenlandic natives, its use should be avoided by foreigners.
The natives of Greenland call themselves Inuit in Canada and Kalalik (plural Kalalit) in Greenland.
Crime, and malice towards foreigners in general, is virtually unknown in Greenland. Even towns do not have such areas. ”
Cold weather is perhaps the only real threat that unprepared people will have to face.
If you travel to Greenland in cold weather (given that the further you go north, the colder it will be), it is necessary to bring enough warm clothes.
Very long days in summer can cause problems related to adequate sleep and health.

A trip to Walt Disney World is like a main pilgrimage for many American families.
Typical trips include flying to Orlando International Airport, taking a bus to an on-site Disney hotel, spending about a week without leaving the Disney area, and coming back home.
There are endless possibilities out there, but it makes sense when most people get there to talk about "going to Disneyworld."
Many tickets sold online through auction websites like eBay or Craigslist are partially used multi-day park-hopper tickets.
Although this is a very common activity, it is prohibited by Disney: tickets cannot be given to anyone else.

Victoria Falls is a city in the western part of Zimbabwe, across the border near Livingstone, Zambia and Botswana.
The city is located next to the waterfalls, and they are major attractions, but this popular tourist destination offers plenty of long-term stay opportunities for both risk lovers and travelers.
In the rainy season (November to March), the amount of water will be high and the waterfalls will look more attractive.
If you cross the bridge or walk on the winding trails near the waterfall, you will surely get drenched.
On the other hand, it's fine because the amount of water is so high that the view of your actual waterfall will become obscured – all from the water!
Tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). The most famous of the KV62 tombs in the valley may have been, the scene of Howard Carter's discovery of the nearly intact royal burial of the young king in 1922.
However, compared to most other royal tombs, the tomb of Tutankhamun is barely worth seeing due to its very small and limited decoration.
Anyone interested in seeing evidence of damage to the mummy during attempts to remove it from the coffin will be disappointed as only the head and shoulders are visible.
The magnificent minarets of the tomb are no longer in it, but they have been removed and placed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
It would be best for visitors with limited time to spend their time elsewhere.
Phnom Chrome, 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. This hill temple was built in the late 9th century during the reign of King Yasovarman.

Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was under the Inca, while the indigenous Arucanians (Mapuche) settled in central and southern Chile.
Mapuche was also one of america's last local independent groups. This group did not accept complete subjugation of Spanish rule until after Chile became independent.

Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth and is around the South Pole.
Tourist visits are expensive, physical fitness demands can only be there in the summer from November to February and are largely limited to the peninsula, the islands and the Ross Sea.
In the summer a few thousand employees live here in four dozen bases in those areas. Even in winter, there are a small number of employees.
Inland Antarctica is a deserted plateau covered with 2-3 km of ice.
Experts sometimes travel inland for mountaineering or to reach the pole, which has a large base.
The South Pole Transit (or Highway) is a 1600 km route from McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea to the Pole.

The most common causes of accidents in the cold are slippery roads, rocky ground (footpaths) and especially stairs.
At a minimum, you need shoes with proper soles. Summer shoes usually slip a lot on the snow, even some winter shoes are lacking.
The pattern should be as deep as needed, 5 mm (1/5 in) or more, and in cold temperatures the material should be soft enough.
Some shoes have studs and studs for slippery conditions are added tools, suitable for most shoes or boots, heels, or heels and soles.
The heels should be low and wide. Usually, sand, pebbles or salt (calcium chloride) are spread to improve traction on roads or paths.
Avalanches are nothing uncommon; The snow grip on the steep slope may be loose. Due to this, the extra part of the ice slips down in the form of avalanches.
