RBS suspends two forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, two people familiar with the matter said, another indication that global investigations by regulators into suspected manipulation of the currency market are progressing at a rapid pace.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed they are cooperating with regulators in investigations into the world's largest financial market, which transacts $5.3 trillion each day.
The two traders will be the first employees of RBS to be suspended as the investigation into what appears to be a repeat of the Libor interbank credit manipulation scandal progresses.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, confirming that it had received a request for information from regulators this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank had said, "Our investigation in this matter is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators." "
Last month, people familiar with the matter said RBS had sent records of emails and instant messages sent to and received from former traders to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
Richard Usher left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been relieved from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JP Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on leave last week, while the former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.
People familiar with the matter said that Mr. Usher's instant messaging group includes bankers from Barclays and Citigroup.
UBS said it has taken action against some of its employees this week after the Swiss regulator, Finma, reported that it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in several Swiss banks.
At least six authorities globally – the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's competition authority Vico, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the US, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are investigating allegations of collusion against bankers to facilitate their optimal volatility in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JP Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted internal investigations, or received requests for information from regulators, people familiar with the matter said.
Banks are closely examining instant messages and emails equivalent to several years in search of clues to any wrongdoing.
The news about the investigation has caused panic among traders in the sector, who have been among the top profit-makers in the trading unit of investment banks for the past several years, but are facing a challenge this year as low volatility in currencies has reduced opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers tried to hush up the matter by saying that it is an impossible scene to manipulate a very large and highly liquid forex exchange, but senior traders say this is not necessarily true.
The senior trader said that despite the huge volume of forex buying and selling, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of their own platforms by banks means that "you can start influencing the market at a slightly lower ticket price." "
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced the departure of the trader from its Exchange Traded Funds Desk in London this week, which had posted a loss of about $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
Credit Suisse said that "we believe that the trader acted alone, and has been controlled." "
A new politics of board changes has begun in municipalities.
Recently, in Sainthia municipality of Birbhum district, the Board of Trinamool was converted due to the defection of councillors of the Congress leadership.
The change took place after most of the Congress councillors, including the municipal chairman, joined the Trinamool.
Not only the Congress, but some councillors from the CPI(M), CPI and Forward Bloc have also joined the TMC here.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy sees this as a good sign for the party.
He said 10 Congress councillors, including Sainthia municipality chairman Virendra Parikh and Congress leader Viplav Dutta, joined the TMC.
Some councillors of the Left Front, including the CPI(M), have also joined the Trinamool.
All of them have written to the district magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of the Trinamool and according to the strength of the numbers, the Sainthia Municipal Board has also come under the control of the Trinamool.
Mr. Rai also claimed that everyone agrees with the roadmap for the development of Bengal under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties, including the Congress, CPI(M), CPI, and Forward Bloc, are moving forward to join the Trinamool Congress.
Qualified leaders of any party are welcome in Trinamool.
The Trinamool's capture of the municipal board in Sainthia municipality is seen as crucial in political circles due to defection of Congress councillors ahead of the November 22 elections to five municipalities.
Earlier, in Left Front-ruled Haldia and Nadia, there are examples of Trinamool occupying the Congress-ruled municipal board.
When the municipal boards in the districts are occupied by the Trinamool due to defections, those joining the party get a grand welcome at the Trinamool Bhavan in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy is excited about leaders breaking away from other parties and joining the Trinamool.
He says that those who break away from any party are welcome in Trinamool.
He claimed that people's faith in the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is increasing, as a result of which people want to join Trinamool.
However, the main opposition CPI(M) said lower-level leaders of other parties were being threatened.
People are joining it fearing the terror of Trinamool Congress.
The CPI(M) is treating the change in the boards of elected local bodies as an attack on democracy.
Any party has the right to increase its support base in a democratic manner, but the rationale of changing the vote in the name of power is bound to be questioned.

Asaram, who is in jail on charges of sexual assault, once again got disappointment from the Supreme Court on Friday.
The media coverage argued by Asaram portrayed him as a child blood drinker Dracula, but the court rejected his demand for a stay on the media coverage.
A bench headed by Chief Justice P Sathasivam refused to order restraining the media from running a story about Asaram, saying he has seen every word reported in the media and sees no reason to interfere in it.
When they are getting information from the police and others, how can we stop them?
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer accused the media of exaggerating news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
But the bench was not impressed by these arguments and refused to interfere in the matter, saying they had other options.
Earlier too, the court had rejected Asaram's demand for a ban on media coverage.
The study has been announced by the British government to increase Scotland's benefits from the HS2 rail project.
Works by HS2 point to high-speed services in Scotland and the northern part of England, which will begin soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer explained that the project would "bring Britain one." "
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said they were "excited" to be working with the UK government on the project.
The first phase will include a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
Upon completion of the second phase, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government revised the cost of building a high-speed link between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which was negotiating with Scotland Transport, directed HS2 Ltd. to consider the possibilities of further improving rail capacity and travel times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing the potential travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London by three hours or less.
According to Baroness Kramer: "Our goal for HS2 is the real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer. "
We are moving forward with HS2, because its benefits will be immense.
Without it, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it's also about the connectivity of 18 cities in the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be better connected because of HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland. "
For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carmichael for Scotland's "clear" return to the HS2 network.
Mr Brown explained: "High-speed rail is likely to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the whole case of high-speed rail across the UK.
We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British Government to examine options to bring high-speed rail to Scotland, create benefits for all and supply the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report with Ministers in the British Government next year and deciding together on the future course of action.
Maninderjit Singh Bitta, national president of the Anti-Terrorism Front, along with 10,000 children, will recite 'Shri Hanuman Chalisa' on November 23 at Dana Mandi near Jalandhar bypass to be organised by Sri Hindu Nyaya Peeth at Dana Mandi near Jalandhar bypass.
This information was given by Bitta to the public after inviting him to recite Hanuman Chalisa on behalf of Praveen Dang, Ashwani Katyal, Bhupinder Banga, Surjit Jain, Bunty Bajaj, Raman Khosla, Bantu and Anil Sharma.
He praised the efforts of Shri Hindu Nyaya Peeth to connect children with Sanatan culture.
He said that for the unity and integrity of the country, it is also necessary to give religious education including worldly education to children.
The Supreme Court refused to stop media reporting.
The apex court said it cannot ask the media not to report on information received from the police or any other source.
Asaram's lawyer said that Asaram is being called Dracula in this case.
There are guidelines for reporting in this case but they are not being followed.
On this, the Supreme Court said that you have many more such treatments that you can use.
Asaram's lawyer said there are thousands of newspapers and 100 news channels across the country, but there are two channels in particular, which is causing him more trouble.
These people are damaging his image and reporting unilaterally.
Asaram's right should be protected in this case.
The court refused to restrain the media from reporting but told Asaram's counsel that he had other legal remedies which he could use.
Black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners are struggling with a lack of funds to repair the collapsed highway system, many are looking for a solution in a small black box that fits neatly on your car's dashboard.
The device, which tracks every mile a motorist drives and transmits that information to authorities, has become a contentious attempt for Washington and the Office of State Planning to renovate outdated systems to finance America's major roads.
In general, even the boring task of highway planning has suddenly become an issue of intense debate and vibrant alliances.
Libertarians have teamed up with environmental groups to gather support in favor of allowing the government to use these black boxes — by keeping details of the miles you've driven, and possibly the location you've driven — and then using this information to prepare tax bills.
The tea party is a buzzword.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned, raising a variety of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree on whether to take further action or not, many states are not waiting.
They're exploring how over the next decade they can move to a system in which drivers pay for every mile they travel on the road.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes for test drives, some of which have GPS. There is monitoring.
It is a really essential commodity for our country.
"It's not a matter of whether we choose or not," says Hassan Ikhrata, executive director of the South California Government Association, which plans to start tracking every mile motorists travel in California by the year 2025.
There is going to be a change in the way we pay taxes.
There is technology to do this.
The main reason for this happening is that the country's Highway Trust Fund has almost gone bankrupt, which is financed by the payment of taxes on gas pumps by American citizens.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Now in a gallon of gas the car runs more miles than ever before.
The federal tax has not increased in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Due to the high price of gas, politicians refrain from increasing the tax by even a penny.
"The gas tax is not affordable at all," says Lee Munich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota. "
His state recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test a per-mile payment system.
"In the long run, it will serve as the most rational option," he says. "
Wonks calls this mileage-based user charges.
It is not surprising that this idea is appealing to urban liberals, as it could, for example, change taxes to change the way cars are driven, which can help reduce congestion and reduce greenhouse gases.
California planners are keen on the system while they develop strategies to meet the targets set out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the Chairman of the Home Transportation Committee, Rip. Bill Schuster (AA-PA) also considers the black box to be the most viable long-term option.
Independent vendors at the Region Foundation are also in favor of pay per mile by the driver.
"It's not just a tax that's going into the blind well," said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Region. "
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. Transportation Secretaries who, in their 2011 report, urged Congress to move toward pay-per-mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million test project last year that would have included 10,000 cars.
But acting on the concerns of the rural lawmakers, who were representing individuals who have to walk a lot of miles daily to go to work or to the city, the House leadership ended that proposal there.
Yet many states and cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most interested is Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the nation's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay mileage charges instead of gas tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed preliminary testing.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is trying with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state departments of transportation along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not find support everywhere.
In Nevada, where the device was installed on the cars of 50 voluntary car drivers shortly before, drivers were impatient that the government could monitor their every move.
"Anxiety about Big Brother and other similar things was a major problem," says Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation. "
It's not something that people wanted.
As the trial progresses, Nevada's ACLU has launched a new test. "It would be fairly easy to convert these devices into full tracking devices," The New York Times warned on its website. "
There is no need to develop a large, unmanageable technology infrastructure that must be spread out to keep a record of everyone's daily movement.
Nevada is one of the many states that is making every effort to get affordable technology that allows the state to get details of how many miles a car is running per day, but not where and at what time.
"If you can do that, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small California start-up called True Mileage.
This firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was attempting to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, with drivers having to pay based on their mileage.
But the device it is testing liked the highway planners, because it has GPS. It is not used and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by the modem at certain intervals.
"If you don't track people's speed and their location, they'll be more willing to adopt this method," said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage. "
There have been some major mistakes in these preparatory programmes of the state.
There are also much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different options.
They are G.P.S. With or without GPS You can choose the device.
Or choose not to take any devices again, but rather choose to pay a fixed fee based on the average miles the residents of the state decide.
Other places hope that this retention can be sold to concerned citizens by providing more convenience rather than less in the device.
In New York City, transportation officials are trying to develop a taxing device that will also allow you to pay parking meter fees, provide "pay according to your drive" insurance, and create a collection of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists can use to avoid traffic.
The city planning document mentions, "Motorists will be attracted to participate in it because of the benefits it brings. "
However, some transportation planners wonder if perhaps all the discussion on miles by pay is a big distraction.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said that Congress can very easily tackle the problem of bankrupt Highway Trust Funds by increasing the gas tax.
Additional one-time or annual fees may also be levied on drivers of hybrid or other cars whose vehicles do not use a lot of gas so that they pay their fair share.
"When aspirin can work, what is the need for radical surgery," said Randy Rentsheller, the commission's director of legislative and public affairs. "
If we do that, millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
Srinagar: The security cover of former minister Ghulam Hassan Khan, who joined the Congress from the Peoples Democratic Party, has reportedly been withdrawn by the police.
Khan blamed the state government for this, saying his security was withdrawn due to political reasons.
Ghulam Hassan Khan Mufti Muhammad Sayeed, who won the 2002 election from Shopian on a PDP ticket, was part of his cabinet when he was the chief minister.
Ghulam Hassan Khan said, "I have been given security cover since 1996.
I live in Shopian, a stronghold of terrorists.
A crpf security squad led by a sub-inspector was stationed at my house.
I have bodyguards with me, but on Thursday, all my security was suddenly withdrawn.
When the security squad was leaving my house, I spoke to the district deputy commissioner and the district SP.
But instead of restoring security, he only said that he would investigate the matter.
When contacted, Kashmir IGP Abdul Gani Mir denied knowledge of the matter and said it was a sensitive matter.
I myself will investigate how the security of a former minister and senior political leader has been removed.
State Congress chief Prof. "To my knowledge, there is nothing of that sort," Saifuddin Soz Se said.
If Hasan Khan's security has been compromised then it is a very serious matter.
I am currently in Jammu and will be coming to Kashmir in the next couple of days.
I will discuss the issue with the concerned administration.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
It has racing seats in the interior and a six-point harness belt, as well as an intercom system.

CDC issues child allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines to control food allergies of children in schools.
Such guidelines have been issued for the first time by the U.S. government, as the number of school-going children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now the U.S. One in every 20 children in the U.S. has a food allergy.
The CDC found that between 1997 and 2007, cases of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent.
The guidelines provide information to schools on how to inform teachers and staff about children's food allergies, and how to handle them in case of an allergic reaction.
Schools have also been suggested to stock up on epinephrine — the most commonly used auto-injector of the EpiPen brand — to combat potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis.
The state assembly has recently updated the rules, allowing schools to easily stock up on epinephrine in large quantities.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children suffering from an allergic reaction.
Children may say "It feels like something is pricking in my tongue," "It feels like I have hair on my tongue," or "My tongue is tingling." "
Aircraft electrical equipment rules to remain in effect in Australia
Despite the easing of equipment regulations in the US, Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smart phones when taking off and landing.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left open the option for U.S. airlines to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight stages, provided those devices are in "airplane" mode.
Passengers can do this on many flights right now, but many people do not like being unable to access their e-books etc. while taking off and landing.
Australian airlines are considering the decision, which requires U.S. airlines to do much more to meet this requirement, but have indicated that they have no immediate plan to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was considering the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electrical equipment at critical stages of flight are still in effect in Australia.
"At present, CASA does not have any specific regulation governing the use of electrical equipment in aircraft," the authority said, adding, "The issue is subject to regulations, according to which airlines have to ensure that safety arrangements are always fully in place, and passengers have to comply with safety instructions given by crew members." "
Virgin, which is already in talks with CASA about expanding the use of its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to comply with this change, but asked for further action on the regulator's directive.
"We would welcome the review by CASA in terms of allowing the use of electrical equipment, as we really feel that it will provide a better experience to customers, as we now have (wireless in-flight entertainment) in our planes," the spokesperson said.
Qantas said it would comply with current regulations for now.
"As per our current policy, electrical equipment cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we have no immediate plans to replace it. "
The FAA decisions apply to U.S. airlines.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit travelers and we will certainly consider the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will vary from US airline to US airline and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Airlines will need to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, as well as revise their manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programmes and briefing passengers.
The FAA said it would allow passengers to use handheld, lightweight electrical devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at all altitudes after airlines verified their aircraft's tolerability. "
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their equipment during landing.
The group has also suggested safe placing of heavy equipment under the seat or in upper compartments during take-off and landing.
He was received at the airport by 42 senior state BJP leaders.
Modi is on a visit to Bihar for the consolation tour organised by the BJP.
The consolation tour is an exercise by the BJP to provide balm to the families of those killed in the blasts in Patna.
It is noteworthy that on October 27, during Narendra Modi's Hunkar rally in Patna, there were a total of seven blasts one after another.
The intention of the Indian Mujahideen terrorists, who were involved in the blasts, was to create a stampede during the rally, so that more people were killed and an atmosphere of panic was created in the state.
That intention of the terrorists did not succeed, but six people lost their lives in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
Party leaders have been on a yatra since Thursday carrying ashes and urns from their village.
On November 5, the ashes of all of them will be immersed together in the Ganga in Patna.
Consolation tour is organized as part of this journey.
Its main character is Narendra Modi.
He will visit the villages of those killed in the blasts from 7 am on Saturday and meet their families.
He will also present a cheque of Rs 5 each to the kin of the deceased.
The BJP has already announced this financial assistance.
The accused used to open accounts of investors by referring to a trading firm and used to cheat in the name of buying and selling shares.
Perhaps for the first time in the state, such disclosures have revealed that crores of rupees have been cheated.
At present, the police have not been able to reach who is the leader of the gang, but seven people, including the accused who looked after his work in the state, have been detained by the police.
The gang operated a fake commodity market under the name of MetaTrader-5.
The company's executives used to take cash from investors and create fake IDs on a fake software.
When trading with this, the accused used to see the shares bought by the investors.
It even knew which share was bought at what price.
In fact, no shares were bought nor there was any transaction for it, because no demat account of investors was opened and shares were falsely shown on this fake software.
Police are estimating that hundreds of people have come under the guise of this gang.
Every investor was made to invest two to five lakh rupees in the name of giving profits.
Its main accused Amit Soni has been detained by the Cyber Cell from Jodhpur, while his six other accomplices have been arrested from Indore.
According to ADG Cyber Cell Ashok Dohre, any share trading company is required to join the stock exchange as a trading firm.
Only after this, the company can get share trading done to investors through itself.
Then the investor's demat account is opened so that shares can be bought and sold for him, but this company named MetaTrader-5 was neither associated with any exchange nor did stock trading done.
The company bought the server for itself on September 24, 2012 in the name of Wintrade citing trading.
Since then, people are being deceived in the name of investment through this company.
At present, eight traders from Indore have come forward to complain to the cyber cell.
Even after selling their purchased shares in profit, their money was not transferred to the account.
On this, he started demanding profit money from the company's shareholders.
Investors are even saying that the fake ID given to them always showed the price of their purchased shares as low.
This price was fixed by the accused at their own level.
The company has appointed its CEOs and agents in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.
The agents used to advise people to join this company by luring them with more profits.
After this, two lakh rupees were deposited from someone and up to five lakh rupees from someone.
Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly acknowledged that in some cases U.S. espionage had crossed the line.
At the same time, he claimed that innocent people have not been tortured under the intelligence surveillance programme.
Kerry's admission came during his address to the annual summit of the Open Government Partnership held in London via video link.
"I assure you that innocent people are not being harassed in this process," Kerry said.
But in some cases, inappropriate methods have been adopted in an attempt to obtain information.
Meanwhile, a key Congressional committee has approved a bill limiting the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency (NSA).
The aim is to make surveillance more transparent and restore the confidence among people that has been hurt by the revelation of large-scale phone tapping.
The Senate's move has been welcomed by six US companies, including Google and Yahoo.
The NSA has also breached the data centers of these companies.
The Senate Select Committee on Friday passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Reform Bill (FISA) by a vote of 4 to 11.
The bill mentions a number of restrictions, including a ban on outright phone tapping under the US Patriot Act.
Under the FISA, intentional unauthorised collection and use of data will be considered an offence and punishable with a jail term of up to 10 years.
The bill will become law after it is passed by both houses of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate.
"The NSA's phone recording program is in accordance with the law and I believe it has made a significant contribution to the security of the country," Senator Diane Festin, chair of the committee, said.
But despite this, more transparency should be brought in it.
Not only this, the protection of public privacy should also be taken care of.
Meanwhile, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook have supported the bill after the NSA's internet surveillance program was exposed.
In a letter to senators, the companies said, "We welcome the proposal of lawmakers to restrict the NSA's large-scale phone recording."
Significantly, the documents released by former CIA employee Edward Snowden exposed the activities of the NSA.
There has been a lot of outrage in the international community after the NSA revealed that it was monitoring the telephone conversations of the heads of 35 countries, including Germany and France.
In an unexpected admission, John Kerry said that the U.S. Espionage has "gone too far inappropriately"
John Kerry unexpectedly acknowledged this by admitting that his surveillance program was in the U.S. The protective attitude of The Associated Press has indicated that sometimes its spying "goes too far inappropriately." "
The Minister of State has also admitted that the NSA is not working. He is also guilty along with Barack Obama for being on an "automatic pilot" as a rebellious disclosure toward whistleblower Edward Snowden about the revelation of espionage activities in the U.S.
This revelation has led to the U.S. The government has brought about a diplomatic shift in relations with its allies.
Speaking via video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "There is no question that the President, myself, and others in government were really aware of some of the things that happened with automatic pilots, because looking back, the difficult years of World War II, and the Cold War,  And then, of course, 9/11 had its potential.
They are U.S. He has become the first high-ranking member of government to acknowledge that the U.S. government is the first member of the government. Espionage has crossed its limits, but has insisted that no one's rights were misused.
He added that: "In some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately. "
And the President is determined to try to make that clear to the people and is currently conducting a thorough review so that no one feels abused.
I assure you that nothing wrong is happening to innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry emphasised that, however, the NSA is not working. It strived for a good cause, and its monitoring work has saved many lives.
"We are facing a world where people are ready to blow themselves up. "
There is radical extremism in the world, which is determined to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
So what's the trouble if you're able to stop it before it happens?
We've saved the plane from actually falling, buildings collapsing, and people being murdered because we've been able to learn in advance about the plans of others.
Meanwhile, on Thursday, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said that the so-called U.S. The U.S. government has been deployed to help address concern abroad about espionage. Lawmakers from The U.S. will go to Europe, and European countries will be sent to the U.S. We will try to explain the need to continue our anti-corruption efforts jointly with the UNITED States.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about threats to block their participation in counter-terrorism organisations due to frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
Murphy, the first-time Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington: "The U.S. It is really important for national security interests that European countries are with us in terms of our counter-terrorism efforts. "
To make it clear to the European countries that we need to continue to work together to fight terrorism, which is the foundation of the NSA. Don't be affected by their anger about the program.
News of the NSA recording millions of phone conversations from Europe has led to u.S. The U.S. has brought acrimony in relations with some allies, although the agency's chief said the reports were not entirely true, and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata shared with the United Nations by NATO allies.
Other disclosures in documents leaked by Snowden suggest that the NSA is not involved in the attack. The company has monitored the cellphones of 34 other top world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended the spying on allied countries as necessary, saying it was common for both sides to do so.
Amid the uproar, Murphy said his office was making arrangements for a visit to Congress that is likely to take place this year, and hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating lawmakers will be released in the coming days.
He said the itinerary is still being worked out.
While Murphy said the purpose of the visit was to improve relations, he said some "impractical relationships" would also have to be sacrificed.
European leaders, along with their people, also have to be honest with their spying programmes used for years, he said.
"Although we can revise our surveillance programme to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones spying," Murphy said. "
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend, where he will travel to the U.S. in Syria, Egypt and Iran. From strategy to U.S. We will resolve the animosity about surveillance activities.
NSA blames hackers for website crash instead of "internal error"
The mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that our website was down for a few hours due to some technical flaw and not due to hackers as some people claimed online.
"Tonight the NSA.gov was out of reach for several hours, caused by an internal error that occurred during a pre-scheduled update," the intelligence agency said in an emailed statement. "
This problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that this disruption was caused by a distributed denial of service [DDOS] attack is not true.
In the evening, online server trackers had found that the NSA had failed to do so. The website was down for at least six hours, and for some users the site is still not accessible.
An NSA spokesperson told ABC. He told The News that there was "absolutely no compromise" with the agency's internal, sensitive network.
The spokesperson said that no classified information is at risk.
At least one hacktivist group has claimed online that they are using DDoS. The NSA was attacked by the attack. Are responsible for blocking the website.
A DDoS attack is designed in such a way that such a large amount of traffic is sent to the target website until the site is closed due to server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former highly mysterious NSA, once dubbed "no such agency", has become the subject of discussion and bitter criticism among the general public in the past months due to the emergence of a large number of foreign and domestic espionage programs – which are collectively alienated from the former NSA. The secret NSA was founded by contractor Edward Snowden. This happened after the files were stolen from the agency and disclosed.
Due to such growing controversy about the agency, after tonight's incident, there was speculation that the incident was the result of targeted cyber operation.
Firefighters were called in to rescue a lost puppy at the mouth of a critical mountain 50 feet above ground in a mine
Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after being hit by a small road
He was spotted three days later by a dog walker trapped in the mine
Firefighters lowered the front portion of the rock with a rope to save the dog from death.
After the puppy somehow got stuck at the mouth of the troubled mountain 50 feet above the ground, the call of firefighters gave him a fortunate life.
Ruby, a nine-month-old cocker spaniel Ruby, fled after being hit by a road on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
His owner Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at the Flappit mine in Westwestern Yorkshire to meet Ruby again, and they have thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After he ran away after a short accident, he searched madly for his lost dog, and posted appeals on social networking sites.
At 2.15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-sighted dock walker spotted Ruby on the mountain in the mine at a height of 50 feet above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckington Fire Station arrived at the scene and pulled Ruby down with a rope to rescue her and used a stomach tube to bring her down the cliff.
Specialist technical rescue officer Andy Clayton said: 'She was in a critical situation.
It was in the middle of the front of the rock, 50 feet from the top and bottom.
He did not make a single movement during the rescue, it remained a stone.
But now she is good.
After that she was eating biscuits.
It was a totally unusual cry for help.
It's incredible to see the dog.
Special Technical Rescue Officer Peter Law said: "Ruby fortunately survived. "
He was likely to be seriously injured or in an even worse condition.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for a check-up, where she was found to be well, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire said: "It was terrible to see the rescue work"
At first, I couldn't believe how she got there.
It's amazing to have him back in my hands.
The veterinarian said that if she was very tired and fell, she would definitely fall down.
The fire brigade did a great job.
What he did was really a very courageous act.
We are grateful to them, and they were all excellent.
Mr. from Kigali. Alderson also said: "We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there. "
The fire brigade did a great job.
I can't believe how she got there.
Due to which the litigants had to suffer.
Addressing the gathering on the occasion, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed strong resentment over the deteriorating law and order situation in the state.
"The increasing attacks on lawyers and their families prove that criminals have become fearless.
They have no fear of the police and the administrative system.
Referring to such incidents that took place at different places recently, he said that when the advocate society is not safe, then the safety of the common man can be easily guessed.
Frontier Airlines will charge carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 to carry-on stores for passengers on board their aircraft.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging $100 for a carry-on bag and will charge $2 for coffee, or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday said passengers could keep the entire compartment.
The new carry-on charge is for bags in the overhead bin, therefore, small bags under the seat will still be free of charge.
Frontier said it will charge $25 if paid in advance, $100 will have to wait if passengers wait to pay while they are at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to be secured to take care of passengers charged in advance.
"We don't want to charge that," he said.
Airlines started charging for first and second check bags in 2008.
Passengers who are trying to avoid charges are stuffed as much as they can in carry-on baggage which is stashed in the overhead compartment, which means there is often less space in this compartment.
Fees are a way to bring less to passengers on board.
O'Malley said the new charges aren't really about raising money.
It's about Frontier to find that overhead bin replacement for most loyal customers has become increasingly difficult.
Passengers buying tickets on the airline's own website do not have to pay this.
This means that the next person in the line may have to pay $100 for a similar bag, while a passenger in line at a Frontier Gate can get one bag free.
O'Malley said frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to ensure passengers are aware of fees before getting to the gate.
Frontier's new carry-on fee will not start until the summer, although a date has not been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines prefer them.
They argue that it costs money to handle baggage, and passengers who want service should pay for it.
Baggage fees on Wall Street are seen by many as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most haven't even touched the carry-on bag fee though.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced carry-on fees for the first time three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, which airline consultant Jay Sorensen said, and which tracks add-on fees.
He estimated that Spirit's carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year which was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former midwest airlines official, recently flew in Spirit and wondered at the passengers who have faced unusual baggage fees at the gate.
"The boarding process was seamless what I had seen in my airline career," he said.
I hoped to grind my teeth and look out at a fight gate.
"The plane was full and they said it was leaky-split."
Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said that travelers who take soda, or juice can keep the entire compartment, and will give it free coffee only for one time.
It will still give away the water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for beverages in 2008, but seven months later after passengers complained they backed out and followed no other main airline after being there.
Frontier's move to charge a fee on carry-on if passengers of Frontier's do not purchase directly from the airline is their latest attempt to drive customers towards their own website.
Airlines pay online travel vendor Orbitz such $10 to $25 for each sold ticket.
That's why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone further in this area.
In September many often began giving up half of the flight miles to customers who bought from an online travel agency from these individuals.
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award by 25 percent of trip miles.
So, a 1000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn 250 miles.
It also allows sole travelers to choose their seats in advance on whether they buy directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home town of Denver, but its business is shrinking and it is losing money.
Revenue dropped 9 percent and its flight capacity dropped nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic Airlines are trying to decide frontier's finances as part of the sale.
The Chinese newspaper will be "renovated"
A Chinese newspaper that made an appeal on the front page for the release of a reporter convicted of defamation will be renovated, a press regulator has said.
Guangzhou-based newspaper New Express had made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But after that, Mr. Chen admitted on television that he had taken bribes to write fabricated stories about the partially-owned state-owned company.
The regulator said that now New Express has to undergo a "complete correction".
The order for "reform" came from the Guangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
"A preliminary investigation revealed that The New Express of Yangcheng Evening News Group had published a lot of false news about the listed company Jumlion in the period between September 2012 and August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that "the editorial management of New Express was chaotic. "
It said it had decided to "impose an administrative penalty by revoking the license of Chen Yongzhou's reporter".
It had "directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to carry out a complete revamp of the New Express, investigate those responsible for it in the New Express, and immediately revise the leadership team of the New Express." "
Mr. Chen wrote several articles in The New Express blaming financial irregularities in a construction-equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published a two-page appeal for his release, saying he had filed a petition against Mr. Supports Chen's journalism.
But after that, Mr. Chen admitted to writing and publishing false stories on state television for money.
He was accompanied by state broadcaster CCTV. "In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win the trust of the public. "
I did this mainly because I was greedy for money and fame.
I have realised my mistakes.
Mr. Following Chen's apology, The New Express issued a front-page apology, saying it had failed to properly investigate his report.
Recently, a number of high-profile suspects have been arrested on TV. There is a spread of blame-acceptance.

In Tests, the players of this team keep making new records and now their status in ODIs is also gradually increasing.
On Thursday, there was also a great example of this when the good New Zealand team won the title by gaining an unbeatable lead in the ODI series.
Sohag Gazi and Mashrafe Mortaza helped Bangladesh beat New Zealand by 40 runs in the second ODI to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.
This is Bangladesh's sixth consecutive win against New Zealand in ODI cricket.
Earlier, New Zealand lost the series 0-4 in the 2010 tour of Bangladesh.
Chasing Bangladesh's target of 248, New Zealand lost wickets at regular intervals in front of the spin of Gazi (34/3) and the stormy bowling of Mortaza (43/3), which reduced the team to 207 runs in 46.4 overs.
For New Zealand, Ross Taylor scored 45, while Corey Anderson scored 37 runs.
Kyle Mills scored an unbeaten 27 while Nathan McCullum contributed 25 runs, but none of the batsmen of the team could convert a good start into a big innings, causing the team to face defeat.
Earlier, Bangladesh were bowled out for 247 in 49 overs despite tamim Iqbal (58) scoring a half-century.
Anderson and James Neesham together took eight wickets.
Anderson took four wickets for 40 runs, while Neesham took four wickets for 53 runs.
Tamim has become Bangladesh's highest run-scorer in ODIs.
Tamim, who surpassed Shakib Al Hasan, has scored 3702 runs in 124 matches.
The third and final match of the series will be played in Fatullah on Sunday.
Police have recovered fake registry, fake seals, laptops and photocopies of the fake registry from the possession of the accused.
Moti Nagar police have registered a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said that the arrested accused are Rajiv Agarwal alias Bintu of Chandra Nagar in Haibowal, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi of Kohara and Sonu of Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of registrar's office (East) fled from the spot.
According to the police, the accused, along with Balbir Singh, clerk and recordkeeper of the registrar's office, used to extract papers from the records of vacant and old lands and then buy new stamp papers and prepare a fake registry on them.
Not only this, after that the real registry would disappear and put it in the fake registry record.
After this, the accused used to sell the land for crores of rupees on forged papers.
At the same time, they used to take loans on these fake papers.
After this, the real owner of the land was shocked by the police and the administration.
The accused, who prepared a fake registry, kept a special eye on the lands of NRIGs.
Because there is no one to look after the NRIG's land.
Therefore, it is easy to create a fake registry of those lands and sell them.
Police Commissioner Gill said that the accused told during interrogation that they have prepared about 150 fake registries so far.
According to the police, the gang leader Rajiv has cases of fraud and theft registered against him in the past.
Children should be taught "as models for a way of writing life", myths and legends.
Thor's stories could show "brute force has no match for all subtle tricks," while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Many of the myths would teach even "exceptionally far away wild and in some cases even" and it would not be appropriate to be taught in schools," Cross Lee Holland advocated a "careful selection" of age-appropriate actions.
"I find it amazing, in the US, myth and folklore already have a part in education," he said.
I've been advocating this as a plan for twenty years.
He has called writers and teachers "over-educatory" and that this is "a new turning point" for children, with messages "being presented" in entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon together with writing the penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folk tales, said: "Your intentions may be a lot but it would be better to keep it out of sight."
Perhaps the big difference between writing an adult writer for a child and writing an adult writer for an adult requires some sense of hope.
But it is an innate sense of good and evil because everything is simplified or come to a happy ending.
And that should be submitted, rather than told through a story.
The old base is not showing.
Bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, who arrived in Pune to inaugurate a portion of the Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, launched a scathing attack on the Congress while addressing an election meeting on Friday.
"In many states of the country and at the Centre, sometimes a coalition government was formed, sometimes of the Congress, sometimes of the Communists and sometimes of the BJP.
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I call upon the political pundits, economists of the country.
Some parameters should be fixed in the country.
Which team did what?
If there is a comparative result, then the question will not come before the country whether the BJP government should come or not.
Whenever the BJP government has been formed, efforts have been made to fulfill the aspirations of the people.
This country is witness to the fact that inflation was low under the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man had two meals a day.
But when the Congress government was formed or supported by it, the poor man did not get enough food.
Not a single Congress leader, not a single UPA leader is answering what they have done in nine-and-a-half years.
Even the media in our country can't reach them.
Congress has become arrogant.
They don't even respond to the media.
Elections are for Lok Sabha, you answer to the people.
Attacking Congress leader Kapil Sibal, Modi said, "Modi is being asked questions every day. In 2014, when the people bless the BJP, they will present an account of their work in front of the public every year.
In a democracy, servants should sit in Delhi, not rulers.
There can be no Nath in Delhi, there should be only slaves.
Congress friends keep releasing balloons every day.
Congress friends, we have already given the exam 10 months ago.
In a democracy, it is the people who take the test.
Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi on Friday expanded his council of ministers by inducting six new ministers.
The oath-taking ceremony of these leaders was held at Mahatma Mandir in Gandhinagar today.

Due to which the cases of violation of the code of conduct have now started decreasing.
As many as 313 cases were registered against various political parties since the model code of conduct came into force on October 4.
At the same time, only 31 cases have been registered from 22 to 27 October.
With the implementation of the election code of conduct, cases of its violation also started coming up.
In the initial days, there were more complaints, but gradually it has started decreasing.
It is being told that in the initial days, due to lack of complete information about the code of conduct, more complaints were coming against political parties.
Due to the Election Commission making political parties aware and taking lessons from the case registered, fewer complaints are coming now.
Many parties were campaigning as before due to lack of information, but when action was taken against them, they stopped it.
Political parties are following the election code of conduct with information about it.
This is also reducing the cases of its violation.
Sood said that the cleanliness system, street lights in the city have completely failed.

But no steps are being taken to put money on the development of the city.
VK Sood said that the problem of dumping ground is the most serious.
Due to the construction of a dumping ground in Sector 23, people living in ghaggar par sectors have been forced to live a hellish life for the last several years.
Municipal officials have been talking about shifting the dumping ground in village Jhuriwala for the last several years, but the people of Barwala area are already facing a serious problem of flies.
He said that the condition of health services and education system in the villages has completely deteriorated.
Till date, no work has been started to provide facilities to the people in rural areas.
Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, known for his bunga-bunga parties, has secretly married a 28-year-old girl.
This has been revealed by his family friend Marthel Polanco.
According to him, the three-time prime minister has married former TV anchor Francesca Pascal in his private chapel.
Francisco met Balusconi when she was a teenage activist at the Forza Italia party.
This is the same Francesca, whose relationship was being said that her relationship with Balrusconi is just a sham.
Berlusconi's close friend and Bunga-Bunga girl Marthel Polanco has revealed that she too was invited to this secret wedding.
The ceremony took place three weeks ago.
In a revelation on Italian Radio 2, when Polanco was asked what would happen if the two got married, Polanco said that they are already married.
It was not a public ceremony.
The wedding took place in a private chapel located in the former prime minister's house.
Apart from this, no one can tell anything.
But she didn't go to the wedding.
He has sent his congratulations to the newlyweds.
Both of them got married about three weeks ago i.e. on October 8 or 9.
About eight months ago, he got engaged to Francesca Pascal, a 28-year-old woman 50 years younger than him.
Berlusconi had blamed loneliness for his decision to avoid embarrassment.

Asaram, who is currently in judicial custody in the Central Jail here on charges of sexually assaulting a minor girl, will celebrate Diwali this year in jail.
Besides Jodhpur, Asaram is also an accused in the case of rape of a Surat-based girl.
At the same time, his son Narayan Sai is running away from the police.
And that is why now an arrest warrant has also been issued against him by the Gujarat Police.
It is also being reported from Ahmedabad that Asaram's trustees have also gradually started distancing themselves from Asaram.
Apart from this, action is also being taken against those ashrams of Asaram, which are built illegally or on government land.
We have already told you that Asaram is the owner of more than 400 ashrams.
One of these ashrams is also in New Jersey, USA.
Asaram and his son are facing various charges.
Even on this, the superstition of many of his devotees is not ending.
Asaram has as much dominance not only in India but also in America.
Here in India, Asaram may be in jail and his devotees are getting away from him, but this is not the case in America.
In the ashram in New Jersey, devotees are still coming to the ashram as before and visiting Asaram.
Scientists have shed further light on the topic of what is the relationship between a dog's tail movements and its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs move their tails more on the right side (from the dog's point of view), while restless dogs move their tails more mainly on the left.
But now scientists say companion dogs can recognize this subtle distinction of the tail and react to it.
The study was published in the journal Current Biology.
Professor Georgia Vellertigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, explained: "It is well known in humans that the left and right sides of the brain are involved differently in the stimulus that generates positive or negative emotions. "
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
They reported that in dogs, just like humans, the right side of the brain was responsible for left-hand movements and opposite order, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to unilateral nostrils by other dogs, the researchers tracked animals watching other dogs' movies.
They measured the heartbeats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't take us long to understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Pro. Vellartigra explained: "We introduced the dogs to movies of dogs – in a realistic version or in the photograph to deal with other confusing issues, and we could see the movement of the tail and render the tail more left or right. "
When the animals saw an emotionless dog moving its tail to the right (from the sight of the dog), they were completely relaxed.
But when he saw the tail changing direction mainly to the left (again from the dog's point of view), his heartbeat increased and he looked restless.
Pro. According to Vellartigara, he does not think the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements.
Instead, they think dogs have learned from their own experience what movements they should be concerned about and what they shouldn't.
He said: "If you've met other dogs several times, and if they move their tails consistently to one side it's related to more friendly behavior, and the right side presents less friendly behavior, you react based on the same experience." "
The findings could provide owners, veterinarians and trainers with a better understanding of animal emotions, the researchers said.
"This is not the first study to examine whether the left or right side is important for dogs," said John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they see an aggressive dog and turn their head to the right when they see a happy dog.
In other research from the University of Victoria in Canada, they reported: "Contrary to the Italian study – when the robot dog's tail moved to the left rather than the right, the dogs were more likely to get close to it rather than to be restless." "
He said that this difference was because in various studies, dogs did not fully understand dogs or robot dogs in the movies.
He explained that studying the way dogs react to real dogs can help.
"While there has been considerable evidence from different mammals that the two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still to be obtained — and dogs are not an exception in this case," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it probably won't take us long to understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
New research has shown that we work with full honesty and dedication in the morning.
Do not lie to anyone and do not think of stealing or cheating.
But in the evening, our mind changes and we keep the ideal aside and start walking against the rule.
In this research from Harvard University and Utah's David Eccles School of Business, researchers have given many interesting facts.
According to the researchers, we prefer moral values while not having work stress in the morning, but in the evening, honesty decreases due to fatigue or excessive pressure.
For this, the researchers conducted two experiments.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell whether the point was more on the left or on the right.
The participants were told that if they give a wrong answer instead of the correct answer, they will be given money.
In this experiment, it was seen that the people who were experimented between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistake and gave the correct answer.
At the same time, while experimenting with people between 12 noon and 6 pm, it was found that they deliberately gave wrong answers keeping their principles in mind.
With this, the researchers were able to prove that the greed for money in the morning does not affect our honesty, but in the evening we stop paying attention to morality.
This research has been published in the latest issue of Psychological Science.
The Gate City Circle office, which is earning crores of rupees per day to the Punjab State Power Corporation, is running in the ruined building.
In such a situation, all the employees are forced to work in fear of accidents.
There is an atmosphere of panic among the staff working due to cement falling from the roofs of this building.
Built in 1913 during the British era, this building previously had the office of the Municipal Corporation.
In 1995, the building was handed over to the Electricity Board.
In the name of repairing it, the department is doing a lot of work by painting it.
The condition of the building has become so bad that the employees are afraid to even sit in it.
The condition of the building is so bad that plaster often falls from the roofs.
In the last one month, cement has fallen from the roofs of four rooms.
Due to this, a female employee has also been injured.
Je and the revenue accountant escaped unhurt in the accident.
At present, about 450 employees work in the building.
This includes 5 XENs, 12 SDOs, 20 junior engineers, 130 clerical staff, 200 technical staff and 20 other staff members.
The situation is that so far nothing has been done by the Powercom high officials about their security.
Three rooms allotted to the JEZ in the building, scooter and bicycle stand, two rooms on the upper floor have completely collapsed.
In such a situation, the condition of the building can be easily estimated.
Coulson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
Andy Coulson, the former editor of the News of the World, has been accused of using "phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face" in an attempt to confirm a so-called intelligence about Charles Clark's affair when he was Home Secretary.
Prosecutor Andrew Addis Q.C. The News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clark was getting along with his "charming special adviser" Hannah Polby.
The court said the newspaper hired private investigator Glenn Mulcare to hack Polby's voicemail and "keep an eye" on the male, but Coulson called and left his voicemail.
Mr. "The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson who is currently N.O.T.W. He is not known for standing outside people's homes and keeping an eye on them, but he puts articles in front of people, seeing how people react to it. "
He said that NOTW The CBI used three methods to investigate the cases: phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face.
The third one consisted of the editors themselves.
Obviously, he knew about the other way, that is, surveillance, he certainly knew.
What about the first one?
Did he know about phone hacking?
He says no, we say "yes, he knew exactly".
Rumours about Clarke's affair have been dismissed by AOTW. It was first introduced by The New York Times' feature desk at a time when a sexually inclined source at Ms. Polby said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles." "
From the home from Mulcare in August 2006, transcripts of voicemail were seized at least three times from Ms. Palby's phone.
The investigators also found entries in the private investigator's computer on which Ms. Polby and her sister were named "Projects."
During the period she was being investigated, Ms. Polby's grandparents were called anonymously asking for information about her.
During this time, former chief reporter Neyville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of Ms. Paulby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson told him via a voicemail: "I've got a story that we plan to run tomorrow, which I would definitely like to talk to Charles about. "
Mr. Addis said Coulson's involvement in the case is in line with other key figures, such as former Home Secretary David Blankett.
The bench heard on Thursday that Coulson had asked Mr. Coulson about his affair with a married woman. He spoke to Dr. Blanket while he was looking into the case of co-defendant Rebecca Brooks who was married at the time.
Coulson & Brooks on 3 October 200. Between August 9, 2006, he denied colluding with others to hack the phone.
Mulcare, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to hacking the phone.
Buoyed by their stunning win in the previous match, India will aim to win the series with a win when they take on Australia in the seventh and final ODI at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.
After two consecutive ODIs were washed out due to rain, India had to win the Nagpur ODI under any circumstances to stay in the series and their batsmen gave them a record victory, giving the team a 2-2 draw in the series.
In the series, Team India has achieved the target of more than 350 runs twice and once again the responsibility of crossing the team's limit will be on the batsmen.
Indian batting is at its peak at the moment and even the biggest target is proving to be a dwarf in front of them.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in tremendous form, but the team will also have high expectations from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja.
As far as opening is concerned, the team has got such an opening pair in the form of Rohit and Shikhar, who are making the job of the rest of the batsmen easier with solid partnerships.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he made a great partnership in the opening and gave Virat a chance to play without any pressure.
Kohli is considered to be the future Sachin Tendulkar due to the virat performance he has done so far at number three.
In fact, many cricket pundits have described him as better than Sachin.
Virat, who turns 25 next week, has scored 17 ODI centuries, out of which India has won 16.
While chasing the target, his average is above 80.00 and he has emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in strong form, but excessive dependence on these three can also be harmful for the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were badly flopped in the last match.
Yuvraj has not even been able to open an account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, a good innings in Bangalore ODIs can work as a 'lifeline' for them.
As far as Australia is concerned, their batsmen, especially captain George Bailey, have impressed everyone with their performance.
There is also a demand to include him in the Test squad for the home Ashes series against England.
Australia has good batsmen up to number nine.
Apart from Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voges and James Faulkner have batted well in the series.
However, Phil Hughes and Aaron Finch have not been able to make any impact in the opening.
Mitchell Johnson's lack in bowling can be a huge burden for Australia.
Johnson, who has performed brilliantly in the series so far, has been sent home to prepare for the Ashes series.
The dream of firecracker traders to do business in the firecracker market located in the transport area did not come true.
Firecracker traders are stuck in Mazdar after the High Court order.
Neither can they now do business in the temporary firecracker market built at Ranjit Avenue, nor have they been issued licenses to trade in the transport area.
The commission, set up by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, declared the makeshift firecracker market on Ranjit Avenue as unsafe during its visit.
A fine of Rs 10 lakh was also imposed on the Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar for not making proper arrangements there.
In its order, the High Court has reprimanded the administrative officers of Amritsar and asked what is the use of such an administration which could not solve even one problem of firecracker traders for nine years.
They could not be provided proper space in the city.
After this, proper security arrangements were made and the firecracker traders were asked to issue licenses for trading in the market located in Jahajgarh.
Even though the firecracker traders were happy after this order, their happiness was dashed by the police on Friday.
A team of the police's arms license branch reached the firecracker market and set up a counter there and sold the farm.
After this, it was impossible to fulfill the conditions given to them in one day.
ACP East Gaurav Garg, Arms License Branch in-charge Anoop Kumar, SHO Sultanwind Arun Sharma reached the firecracker market.
He expressed dissatisfaction over the arrangements made by the firecracker traders.
Therefore, licenses were not issued to firecracker traders.
There is only one day left for Deepawali.
Due to this, firecracker traders are upset.
They see a loss of crores of rupees.
Firecracker traders Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni said they would stake claim on the district administration if they incurred losses worth crores of rupees.
Angry firecracker traders took out a protest march from Jahajgarh to Ranjit Avenue on Friday night.
They raised slogans against the police and the district administration.
After this, the business was also closed in the temporary firecracker market running in Ranjit Avenue.
Head Constable Om Prakash retired after serving for 32 years in the police department in Ghumarwin.

It is true that our work cannot be done without money.
Money is one of the biggest needs for a living, but it is not in our interest to accept it as everything.
We celebrate Dhanteras on Krishna Trayodashi of Kartik month.
On Dhanteras, Kubera, the god of wealth, and Yamraj, the god of death, are worshipped.
Money has an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good or bad.
Our feelings for money are good and bad.
There can be no more valuable commodity than money that is useful for the welfare of humanity, but money that causes arrogance has no meaning.
We should earn money for a holy purpose and spend it for a sacred purpose.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the sustenance of the family.
There should also be a feeling of spending some part of it on society, but the tendency to collect unaccounted money or earn money in yen-ken way destroys our conscience, personality.
The spirit of charity should always remain in the mind.
Even a fraction of the money you give can become the basis of someone's living.
Many people in the society are living in abject deprivation, we all should think about them.
In fact, meaning, religion, work and salvation have been given equal importance in the purushathar of life.
All people wish for wealth and fame and according to their efforts, they also get wealth and fame.
The same wealth is sustainable with which respect is associated.
No matter how rich a criminal may be, he can neither consume it properly nor can it be of any use to anyone else.
If someone else has money, don't be jealous of him.
The true rich are the ones who make the way for wealth to flow into the innumerable hands.
There is no better use of money than the creation of employment for others.
One more thing, money is not just in the form of money.
It would also have been in the form of your health, character, love for others.
Try to become the owner of this money.
The human population has crossed the 7 billion mark.
If the population continues to grow like this, soon a time will come when it will be difficult for every hungry mouth to get water.
According to experts, in the near future, humans will have no choice but to eat insects.
According to reports, a group of students from McGill University in Montreal won the Hult Prize for a unique project this year.
He has been given this award for preparing protein-rich flour from insects.
As a prize money, he has been given $ 1 million in assistance, so that he can further his research and experiments.
In an interview with ABC News on September 30, the group's lead student researcher, Mohammad Ashore, said his team would now experiment with locusts for food.
This report contains a detailed description about edible insects.
A day earlier, the Special Task Force (STF) had revealed a fraud in the PMT of 2012.
The STF has found discrepancies in the roll numbers of 700 students in the investigation.
Of these, about 125 students had taken admission in medical colleges.
Now the admission of these students can be canceled.
After the STF's revelations, the Medical Education Department has started brainstorming to cancel the admission of these students.
According to the information, the department is waiting for the list of all these suspected students to be received from the STF.
The list will be sent to Vyapam to cancel the eligibility of the students involved.
However, the department is also talking about taking legal advice in this matter.
Departmental officials say that it has been a year since the students took admission in the year 2012, so it is necessary to seek legal advice in this matter.
As the matter is currently confined to the STF investigation, the medical education department officials are not in a position to say anything.
Vyapam director Tarun Pithore said that if the STF submits a list of suspected students with evidence, their admissions will be cancelled immediately.
On the other hand, Director Medical Education Dr. Nirbhay Srivastava said that if the students are found to be fake admissions, they have not even refused to cancel their admission.
According to STF officials, fake students involved in the 2012 PMT are being investigated.
After investigation, the list of suspected students will be handed over to Vyapam.
Vyapam had cancelled the eligibility of 345 suspected students who appeared for the PMT exam held in 2013.
Out of these 345, the Medical Education Department has so far cancelled the admission of 84.
New anti-nicotine vaccine may end smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that can end the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to keep mice safe from nicotine addiction for the rest of their lives.
Further testing is needed before human trials can begin, which could take several years, but Ronald Crystal, a professor at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said the initial signs were positive.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccine strategy may eventually help the millions of smokers who have attempted to quit smoking using all the methods that are on the market today, but they found that their addiction to nicotine is far more powerful than these current methods," Cornell said. "
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus designed to deliver genetic information aimed at creating anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cell, which then begins to form a steady stream of antibodies.
Antibodies detect any nicotine molecules in the blood, and by neutralizing them before they reach the brain, they prevent nicotine cravings from rising inside the smoker.
In the trial, the vaccinated mice that were later given nicotine continued to perform their normal activities.
But the rat that wasn't given the vaccine "felt good," the researchers said, adding that it was a sign that nicotine had reached its brain.
The experiment was described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Earlier tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The dose had to be given at regular intervals so that the level of antibodies was maintained, but it proved to be expensive and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be very high, because the liver will make the cell a factory of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe, it can be given to children before the temptation to try cigarettes, so that they can be protected from nicotine addiction.
But it will probably be used by smokers to quit smoking.
"They will find that if they start smoking again, they won't get any pleasure from smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which can help them quit the habit," he said.
British scientists described the results as interesting, but warned of the need for much more research.
German-American model Heidi Klum's fans are also shocked to see what she did.
Young hearts were pounding in such a way that it was difficult to identify them.

When a crowd of horse showcasing experts gathered in Cardiff to showcase the horse for the best horse of the year, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even going to school yet and a few months away from taking their first steps, this little boy and his pet Shetland pony Taffy easily completed three stages and won the top prize – beating his 30 adult competitors.
At the annual competition organised by the Sunnyback Equestrian Centre in Rudry, near Cardiff, the unbreakable pair – which is the same length as Sk – was highly praised for their appearance, behaviour and style.
In front of men and women wearing beautiful bowler hats, she tilted her flat hat at an alhad angle and made her two-year-old Toffee circle the ring.
Decision-makers praised Fenton for his natural ability to control that goes far beyond his age.
And Toffee received the highest marks for her appearance and personality.
Fenton was given the toffee as a gift on her third birthday last March, and she has practiced with the Shetland pony daily since then.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said: "Fenton and Toffee are a fantastic pair. "
They had to face challenges from all the candidates, but both of them won the Gold Cup and Rosette.
This was only the second time she had competed with Toffee, and we are all very happy with her victory.
Standing out in this amphitheatre, he was found so amazing by everyone that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This little boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Abbey Well, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been demonstrating horses for more than 10 years.
Mr. Howells said: "The whole place was full of enthusiasm, and everyone was celebrating and clapping. "
He was running on the sand all over the theater, and despite looking so small he did an extraordinary job.
Fenton is a cattle lover – he loves horses, tractors and farms, and has raised two chickens that he cares for.
The kind of start he's made will be at the best horse exhibition of the year long ago – and I'm confident he'll do very well.
A spokesman for the annual horse exhibition said: "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to control his pony. "
They are a very good couple.
The judges awarded points for the way Fenton and Toffee performed and the way they performed in the show ring.
He saw good team work between the pony and its rider – in this case Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm pretty sure Fenton's lovely clothes helped him, he really looked very different.
UN sets new targets to tackle poverty
The United Nations will soon begin work on a new set of goals that will replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
M.D.D. courses are ending in 2015. The Australian diplomat played a key role in pushing the "Sustainable Development Goals" just before the Sustainable Development Summit that began overnight in Rio de Janeiro.
These were included in the final draft of the document, which will be endorsed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the nightly summit that the time had come to "rise above national interests."
"I am very happy that member countries have agreed to initiate and take ownership of the process to establish the Universal Sustainable Development Goals. "
This is s.d.g. The Millennium Development Goals will be based on our development, and will be a composite part of the post-2015 development framework.
Based on the success of the MDGs, I will make every effort to implement the mandate given to me by our Member States to meet our far-reaching objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals.

Tax on foreign property owners will put an end to London's artificial situation
The Finance Department has provisionally approved the CGT. The measures have been calculated, but Mr. A final decision is awaited from Osborne, who introduced a stamp duty of 7 percent in the 2012 budget for houses worth more than £2 million, and for individuals who prefer to own a house in a company rather than an individual individual.
In the tax year 2012/13, the stamp duty from residential properties in Westminster and the cities of Kensington and Chalesa was £708 million, which is already higher than the combined sum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and the North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr. Cook explained: "After the increase in stamp duty on high-value homes and the introduction of associated anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that high-value properties are taxed less than reasonably untaxed, which has nothing to do with the impact of the outdated council tax system.
"But the move could make some foreign investors silent on buying properties in London and reluctant to sell them to current owners," he added.
Prime Properties, the top 5 to 10 percent share of the housing market by value in wealthy south-west London, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, grew by a record 11.8 percent last year.
According to Savills' research, central London's prices continued to rise regularly by 5.6 per cent each year, but the rise seemed to be slightly lower than in the "domestic market", as the city's south-west, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent) were seeing a surge.
In view of Deepawali, the demand for sweets increases.
In view of this, the sale of substandard and fake mawa increases.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more shiny, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous for health.
The Food and Drug Administration department has launched a campaign against fake mawa and chemical-containing sweets.
The department seized mawa worth Rs 70,000 from Madhya Pradesh and Rs 5,000 from Quetta colony.
With the increase in demand for sweets in the market, the demand for substandard mawa from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The department received information that substandard mawa kept in the dirt was brought from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
The consignment of Mave is being brought to Nagpur from the transport garage.
The department seized the mawa, which was valued at Rs 70,000.
Fearing action, no one claimed the right over Mave.
The department destroyed it as unclaimed property.
The department raided Jeetendra Caterers located in Quetta Colony and recovered about 5,000 spoons.
A chemical called sodium hydrosulfite was used to shine and last longer.
Its sample will be sent to the laboratory.
S.S. Deshmukh, Joint Commissioner of the Department, said that the campaign to catch chemical-rich sweets and substandard and fake mawa will continue.
Information has been given by the department to intensify this campaign in the next few days.
Consumption of these sweets can also cause poisoning.
The department asked the sweet traders to make sweets from good milk, mawa.
The department has appealed to the people to be ware of fake sweets and mawa.
Egypt believes in first freely elected president
Mohamed Morsi has taken the oath of office, but his Victory Day hardly ended the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn into office as the country's first freely elected president, replacing ousted Hosni Mubarak 16 months ago.
Upon his formal installation before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi became the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president, and Egypt's fifth head of state since the monarchy was overthrown nearly 60 years ago.
He took the oath in his chair in front of 18 judges in black robes on the banks of the Nile river, which resembled an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are hoping for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during a formal ceremony broadcast live on national television. "
The radical group Muslim Brotherhood, which has spent 84 years since its inception as an outlawed organization, and has been a target of previous governments, has been the party's u.S. government. "Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life - complete freedom, true democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Morsi, an engineer trained in the U.S. "
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building and Morsi arrived in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to greet the new president, with traffic also briefly halted to allow his motorcade to pass through the normally busy road that connects the city centre to its southern suburbs.
Morsi's personal reputation, ridiculed as the brotherhood's non-charismatic "empty tire", grew greatly after his victory, and his speech on Friday presented him not only as an Islamist but as a candidate for all those who want to complete the task of the 2011 revolution against dictatorial Mubarak.
"Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern nation," Morsi said as he took the oath of office before judges sitting in a wood-paneled chamber. "
Morsi then went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural address.
They were given an official welcome by the military band playing the national anthem while they stood in a state of caution.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussain Tantawi was also present.
On his arrival, hundreds of people present in the lecture hall at the main university there greeted him with the slogan "The army and the people are one hand".
Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the years 1970.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square, the cradle of a revolution that ended Mubarak's dictatorial rule last year, and vowed to take back presidential powers stripped of his post by the military council from the leader ousted last year.
But they traditionally bowed to the will of the military by agreeing to take an official oath before the court rather than having parliament take a competent oath, a sign that the struggle for power would continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic popular currencies.
You may not believe it, but it's true.
Not only this, the mission road has been named after municipal council president Anjali Kumari.
In fact, the Jharkhand Vikas Yuva Morcha has made this name to express its displeasure over some of the bad roads in the city.
The event was led by JMM central secretary Sachidanand Pandey.
British police send extradition notice to Assange
British police today sent an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and has sought asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had sent a "surrender notice" to 40-year-old Australian Assange, which would require him to appear at a police station, failing to do so he would be responsible for his arrest.
Assange is facing extradition to Sweden on sexual offence charges, and his options under British law have lapsed after the Supreme Court earlier this month rejected his appeal against extradition.
Stockholm is home to them in the U.S. Fearing that he would be handed over to the South American country, he requested asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
A spokesman said Scotland Yard had "sent a surrender notice to 40-year-old Assange, requiring him to appear at the police station on the date and time we choose." "
He is in violation of his bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the police notice.
Assange fears that more than 250,000 U.S. hackers have been arrested on an anti-secrecy website called WikiLeaks. Due to the release of diplomatic cables, Sweden will be extradited to the United States to face possible espionage charges.
Department officials claim that this is the biggest TDS evasion case so far.
The group operator of the mall deducted TDS and paid it to the concerned financial institutions, but did not pay it to the government treasury.
By doing so, he kept depositing TDS money with himself.
On October 17, the investigation team from Mumbai along with the Jaipur investigation team took action on this group.
In the investigation of this episode, it was found that this businessman has deducted TDS but did not deposit it.
For this reason, the TDS team started the action of income tax survey on this group on Thursday.
About 15 days ago, raids and surveys were conducted on the group of this mall operator.
Angered by this action, this businessman has clearly told the income tax department officials that he is not ready to pay TDS money to the Income Tax Department right now.
The Income Tax Department is constantly targeting them and taking action.
The officials investigating the case have clarified that in case of non-payment, recovery action will be taken by sealing the accounts.
Oil continues to decline towards $96 a barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, as evidenced by a report showing concerns over oversupply, where China's power-hungry construction sector continues to strengthen.
U.S. crude for December delivery was down 14 cents at $96.24 a barrel by late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, falling 5.8 percent for the month of October.
Adequate supplies of crude oil have weighed on the price in recent weeks.
U.S. supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week, the Department of Energy said on Wednesday.
Over five weeks, supplies have increased by more than 2.5 million barrels.
But a suggestion of strong demand is an increase in activity that showed that two reports on Chinese manufacturing came Friday.
This suggests that growth may continue to strengthen China's economic recovery after a two-decade low of 7.8 percent in the previous quarter.
Brent crude also fell 26 cents from $108.58 a barrel on the ICE Exchange in London, a benchmark for international crude used by U.S. refineries.
Pawan Bansal, who was surrounded by opposition questions at the railway gate, surprised the opposition by saying that he had not looked at anyone's woman in 15 years.
After this, everyone was surprised that where did the woman's talk come from.
Perhaps Bansal was referring to the domestic relations between a senior BJP leader and a councillor.
Turning the matter to the other side, Bansal told reporters that the BJP had conspired during the last parliamentary elections to put a woman behind him to lodge a complaint, which did not succeed.
Talking to reporters, Bansal said he has been questioned by the CBI in connection with the railway bribery case.
If he was made a witness in the case, would he have been made only after a thorough investigation?
Bansal said that in the booth scam he is talking about, he had written a letter only for a needy person.
If this is their crime, then they will always commit such a crime.
He said though he did not have the constitutional right to raise the issue in the Corporation House, he himself asked the opposition to speak.
He said that as far as the development work is concerned, the opposition will be given a list of development works of 15 years.
The way Chandigarh is being developed or going to be, these people cannot even think there.

Students studying other courses, including technical and management, running on the campus will be able to exercise their voting rights this time.
The university vice-chancellor has written a letter to the governor seeking permission to hold the elections.
With the commencement of the admission process in the university, there was a demand for holding student union elections.
He had also launched a signature campaign to select his representative to make his voice heard by the university administration and college management.

The council had launched a signature campaign for the election.
Akash Jaiswal, Department Coordinator ABVP
After Diwali, permission will be sought from the district administration to conduct elections in colleges.
There are also problems due to lack of clarity on the attitude of colleges regarding the student union elections.
The entire market was full of customers in Rani Bagh market.
The situation was such that people had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes to buy utensils.
Similar was the situation in Wazirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market, and Central Market in Prashant Vihar.
A similar scene was seen at sarafa shops in Pitampura, Ashok Vihar, Model Town.
Here too, people bought gold and silver jewelry and coins fiercely.
Due to this, there was a jam in other markets including the Outer Ring Road.
However, people who left for home from office had to spend hours in jams to reach home.
The YMCA had filed a complaint against Jonathan Lord before the charges. Royal Commission holds trial on two employees accused of sexual offences
Before charges were brought against Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011, the YMCA had filed a complaint. Two NSW employees have been charged with child sexual offences.
But in its statement before the commission, it said it had "never come across any case of child sexual abuse within its organisation", the commission was told.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the case in which the YMCA has been arrested. One employee of the YMCA was charged with child pornography offences, and another case in which the YMCA was arrested. The Carringbah gym instructor was charged with child sex crimes against children in his care in 1991.
Advocate Gail Furness, who assisted the Commission, said: Hare said he knew about the first case, but he did not know about the second case.
He also admitted that the YMCA had filed a complaint before the commission. The statement that "YMCA An external inquiry has been conducted and they have been sent to the YMCA. Has been found to be at the forefront of child safety" is also not accurate.
There is evidence before the Commission that the YMCA has been banned. It received the second lowest rating among four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Communities Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare which is y.m.c.a. The Company, who has been associated with The World Bank since the age of 21, admitted that the management "including myself" had failed to appoint Lord, and failed to ensure that employees were clearly aware of their obligations to report child protection policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was appointed to the YMCA. He was convicted of sexual offences with 12 children during his two-year tenure.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Hare denied the suggestion that the YMCA should resign. There was a cultural problem in the U.S., due to which the staff did not report a child safety violation by the Lord.
What the staff saw about the violation was evidence that included Lord spending time alone with the children, babysitting them privately, making them sit on their laps, telling them he loved them and letting them play on their mobile phones.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under Lord's supervision, and had asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that the YMCA, which supervised Lord, had been arrested. Caringbah child care manager Jackie Bernat was "very threatening and difficult to get by most of the time".
The CEO said that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not comfortable giving the above information to their manager.
She said that, rather her friendship with Lord misled her decision to give information about her.
Mr. Hare said that he has joined the YMCA. The NSW had provided its view to the board that, from the "Jonathan Lord incident" the text for the organization was "about not giving information".
Mr. Hare said the decision to get the employees to sign the confidentiality agreement was taken immediately after the allegations surfaced. It was conducted by Liam Whiteley, General Manager of Child Services.
He said the aim was to avoid blending of evidence, but it was "overzealous" and not executed properly.
Stephen Smallbone, special professor of child sexual abuse at Griffith University, said the YMCA was involved in the operation of Jonathan Lord between 2099 and 2011. The NSW was not a secure organisation.
He said there were "serious problems" in appointment, monitoring, admission, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing has been adjourned till December 20.
Ponnbrokers' silver due to hardship felt by middle class in Singapore
At a pawn shop in Singapore's Bendemeier shopping centre, Janani Ameerthalinga is taking cash with her gold bangles, rings and earrings to pay her daughter's school fees.
"My husband and I have recently bought the house, so all our money is stuck in it. "
She says that, although she earns SGD 3,000 (US$2,400) as an administrator, and her husband also employs, the family's monthly income remains inadequate.
In fact, similar demand is in parts of South-East Asia – where domestic debt is rising – Valuemax where they are conducting their transactions, becoming the third pawshop to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Mortaging jewellery is not only the only way to get cash – 1,300 Singapore dollars in Ms. Ameerathlinga's case – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Generally, pawnbrokers in Singapore charge 17 per cent per annum, slightly higher than the 15.4 per cent offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender that has a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requiring a credit check or proof of salary, and they can provide loans faster than the bank.
Millions of people in the region are turning to pawnshops as families face hardship due to rising living expenses and increased household and consumer debt.
With their economies slowing down in five years after the global financial disaster, with strong growth in the aftermath of the global financial disaster, and cheaper credit due to easier monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income households are turning to pawnshops to meet their needs.
This week, rating agency Standard and Poor's cited rising domestic profits, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt to GDP ratio in Asia, it said.
Malaysia GDP It tops the list with 80 per cent of the GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged mildly from the tech downturn this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a sustained export slowdown and a slowdown in consumer demand.
Malaysian Bank, CIMB "The turning point is that with rising prices, people falling into the middle to lower class [of the income scale] will try to increase their incomes in every possible way," said Song Seng Wun, an economist in The New York Times. "
The historically high prices of gold in the last two years have prompted people to mortgage personal assets, as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to cash in on the value of their family's jewellery.
In Singapore, 70 per cent of the items pledged at the city-state's 200-pound outlet are gold.
People are saying "Gold is looking good, let's pledge grandma's gold chain, and take it back next month."
Thailand's largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months.
There is so much growth in the mortgage business that Valuemax, the operator of the outlet in Bendimir, and 15 others like it in Singapore, are planning to expand not only in their neighbourhood, in Malaysia where it has four shops, but also outside Asia, says Yah Li Ching, executive director of Valuemax.
The company will finance it using 60 percent of the SGD 66 million it received in its listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount lenders have been criticized for high interest rates, Ms. Yah says that pledging not only fetches a cheaper rate than other lenders, but it also doesn't directly increase lending.
"Customers pledge items they already have, and redeeming personal assets does not increase household debt," she says.
There is a growing social acceptance of pawnbroking to get short-term and secure financial support.
It is not that only financially weak individuals use pawnbrokers.
Wealthy individuals in Singapore also use Valuemax outlets, pledging gold bars or Rolex watches, which can provide cash payments of up to 60 percent of their purchase price.
We have customers from all sections of the society.
"These include wealthy individuals who need short-term loans for business ventures or investments, or small businesses that need to meet their cash flow needs," says Ms. Jah. "
Sometimes they need money in just a very short time.
On Dhanteras, people have bought a lot of utensils, gold and silver in the capital.
There has been an increase of 20 to 30 percent in such purchases compared to last year.
In Shimla, there was a rush of people in jewellery shops.
A huge crowd was also seen in the pottery shops decorating from Lower Bazaar to Mall Road.
Although there was an eclipse of inflation on such items this year, people still did not show hesitation in shopping on auspicious occasions.
On Friday, the auspicious time for shopping was from 7:52 am to 10:12 am, from 1:56 to 3:37 pm and from 6:17 pm to 8:12 pm.
At the time of these three muhurats, there was a large crowd of people in the suburbs including Shimla for more shopping.
In Shimla Lower Market, people did not find a place to sit.
The crowd in every small and big shop was also like this.
In such a situation, when shopping on Dhanteras, celebrated as Dhantrayodashi of Krishna Paksha of Kartik month, is a sign of auspicious Deepawali.
According to the information, on Thursday, Habibullah Malla was going towards an urban willow nursery in Haritara-Sopore.
Suddenly a bear attacked him.
She shouted for help, resisting the bear.
By the time people from nearby areas reached the spot to help him, the bear had badly scratched his face.
People raised an alarm while throwing stones at the bear.
At this, he left Habibullah and hid in the nursery.
The villagers rushed the injured Habibullah to the hospital for treatment.
$325 million rescue package for Taji's health
The union government has insisted that the $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's ailing health system comes with stringent conditions that will ensure the state government can't waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent action" to address the current crisis caused by the island state's aging population, high rates of chronic diseases, and system limitations.
The decision to fund the four years was taken in consultation with the Government of Tasmania's independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has come out with an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the specific challenges facing the state," Ms Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package also includes a $31 million elective surgery plan.
The 2600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgeries, will help address the previous collected cases.
It also includes funding for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Lawns, better post-hospital care, training of medical specialists, mental health services and introduction of personal electronic health records system in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the best practices outlined to me by leading physicians to improve Tasmania's health system," said Ms Plibersek. "
The minister stressed that the government of Tasmania will face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State must maintain the current funding level to receive Commonwealth funds, and report every month where the additional funds are being spent.
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the service is provided by the state in the most effective and efficient manner possible.
Mr Wilkie said the $325 million would not mean much, "unless real reforms are made to bring Tasmania's public health system to a more sustainable level." "
He, however, praised the government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he had first brought to the Prime Minister in early May. "
"I hope that the federal aid package will be very helpful in removing the state public health system from the crisis-ridden list," Wilkie said. "
According to the state government, these additional alternative procedures will mainly undo the recent cuts.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "band-aid solution." "
He is an A.B.C. student. "We're here for this reason because the Labour State government has taken $430 million into its health system.
You can't think of the state government taking in half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth giving $300 million as good news days.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms. Plibersek should guarantee that not a single dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
NSA revelations about state surveillance fuel corporate fear.
Late on a quiet day in August, a German police helicopter blew over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
At the direction of the Office for the Defense of the Constitution (BFV), the mission of Germany's domestic intelligence agency was to photograph the roof of the US outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media asked BfV to express hope to identify the presence of the listening antennas and indicated an exchange action between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Klepper, director of U.S. national intelligence, emphasized that the U.S. use its foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal foreign companies' trade secrets and to help U.S. companies increase their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line." Then don't use it in September.
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has become a whistleblower, began revealing his treasure trove of secrets to U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure if the director will keep his word.
The U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, expressed fears about state surveillance.
The last thing came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly a decade ago.
If Europe's most powerful individuals can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible that these data be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up" says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published in July by the consultancy of German companies, the U.S. has almost now become a bigger risk than China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
In all the documentation leaked by Mr. Snowden, there is, however, no evidence to date that the U.S. has known the trade secrets of foreign companies to its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the EU's lack of internet capabilities. And it should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German Parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and gently open them again...
"That's no way," said Haso Plattner, president of German business software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they wouldn't have to die 20 years ago.
Everything is discounted in Germany. From coal, cars, farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
Snowden's revelations about U.S. technological sophistication and spying reach have proved to be a shock to some companies who previously believed china was the biggest surveillance threat.
A major shift is taking place in the cloud computing sector where European authorities are more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore have become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade entity, some 10 percent of non-US members canceled plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after revelations about a data prism mining program.
Jim Snabe, co-CEO of SAP, says: "We noticed a new question that customers didn't come across a year ago – where is my data stored? And can you guarantee that it will physically remain in that jurisdiction?"
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are simply confirming what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and data and therefore must be guarded at all costs.
That economic espionage happens is not a surprise.
It has always happened.
"This has been a topic for many years, and through the fundamental current discussion, nothing has changed," says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical manufacturer BASF.
Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial level and we do too, because it's in the national interest to defend our business.
Corporate leaders are generally not interested in the defense system and this is an advantage for the attacker.
For large companies, the message has been recorded for a long time whether it's unwise to leave a USB stick in business from home or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member of automaker Audi, says it's a year-old system of collecting mobile phones before board meetings because they can't be used as remote listening devices.
Germany's BfV executive advises you to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when smart phones are compromised due to risks on foreign trips.
The prepaid mobile phones were then thrown away later.
However, small and medium companies are in danger of hacking and monitoring it is a concern.
In Germany, many companies are top in the global market in special place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access," BfV warns in a report.
The US has warned about economic spying on its own companies by other countries.
According to The Washington Post, in February, US national intelligence named Russia and Israel as one of the second tier of criminals involved in hacking economic intelligence behind China.
According to a board member of a German blue chip company, when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, explains in the interview: "The services are well aware that all countries, even if they join in the non-terrorist fight, spy on their allies."
Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial level and we do too, because it's in the national interest to defend our business.
No one was fooled.
A large number of participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatra districts attended the training.
Over a period of seven days, all the participants were given information about tent pitching, flag pole and many other disciplines.
The responsibility of training is being completed with the help of Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
All the participants are spreading the feeling of unity by joining the all-religion prayer.
Camp head Vipin Kumar State Training Commissioner is giving his special support.
State media member Ajay Rai said that they will go on a massive campaign there from November 4.
Bhagat will concentrate himself in the assembly constituencies of Chhattisgarh adjoining Jharkhand.
They are also well aware of these areas.
They will stay in Chhattisgarh continuously till November 16.
There is a lot of demand for Jharkhandi leaders in the election season of Chhattisgarh.
More than two dozen BJP leaders are already gathered there.
The Congress had also requested JMM supremo Shibu Soren and Chief Minister Hemant Soren to campaign for the party in Chhattisgarh, which has been accepted by the jmm's top leadership.
The JMM has also withdrawn 10 of its candidates announced earlier.
The JMM has directed the Chhattisgarh state committee to get all the leaders involved in the election campaign in favor of the Congress.
Obama slams voters' disappointment
I voted twice for Obama in anticipation of change.
They say that the GOP Obama's great efforts have been hampered by the U.S. policy of obstruction.
Obamacare website's troubles, can't excuse drone strikes
The 2008 campaign memoir of the Obama year is a reminder of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading very sad books these days.
This is a book that I think will excite me and give me a ray of hope during my second year medical school depression.
It's called "Dare to Win," and is a reminder of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I find my patients' prescriptions relaxing at night and going to bed, this book takes me to a period in which politics inspired millions and speeches could hold your breath.
The elections proved to be one-sided, and news speakers took a break to reflect the historical significance of the time.
My classmates had tears of joy in their eyes, and my parents saved every newspaper they received.
A team of young visionaries was going to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
When Obama became president in 2008, he had an 82 per cent approval rating.
And then I closed the book.
The reality of the present is a harsh truth, like returning from the dream world.
Those days of hope are hard to remember – they seem to be a distant memory, a sad memory of lost opportunities.
It was really changed after I voted for the first time.
Simply put, I couldn't have imagined any of it.
I owe Obama with many accomplishments, from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our forces from Iraq, to the end of "don't ask, don't tell" to the killing of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that a policy of partisan protest has prevented many of our country's efforts to move forward: immigrant reform, public alternatives to healthcare, the closure of bases at Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But there are innumerable times when I defended the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues, and I ran out of answers I could give them.
I have reached a point of political disappointment.
The Republican protest policy is not the answer to spying on foreign leaders, nor the answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond to the National Security Agency's collection of data about the personal lives of ordinary American citizens, nor can it respond to prosecuting people who expose the government's wrongdoings.
It cannot explain the reason for the murder of American citizen Anwar L. Awlaki without trial, nor the decreasing public funding and spending limits during the presidential campaign.
It cannot answer the findings of the report, which says the White House's efforts to silence the media "have been the most aggressive since the Nixon administration." "
And most recently it can't excuse the failure to design a simple website even three years after it was signed into law by the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the system of governance could contradict the political campaign that brought it forward.
Clearly, elected office is not a predictable path, as opposing political parties and random events, such as the Newtown massacre, will shape our public discourse.
Yet most of the examples I have given above appear to have been chosen by the administration itself.
That's what bothers you the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and uncertain choice that did not seem to dictate his policies or his position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hopes we've long heard about.
Yet, while Obama's approval rating is below 45 percent this week, it has become much harder to return to the year 2008 through that book.
Seeing him reminds me of his missing promises.
This week I was reading a portion of the book that described how Clinton didn't suffer a huge loss because of Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
At a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinates that they needed to get back on track, and remain true to their objectives.
He said "I want to get my mojo back".
We must remember who we are. ’
Today, after five years, Mr. President, I cannot agree with you more.
The views expressed in this comment are those of Nathaniel Morris.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons manufacturing capability, the monitoring group said.
On Thursday, the monitoring group said Syria had destroyed chemical weapons and equipment critical for making toxic gas war materials, while a raging conflict emerged in northern Syria, which is very close to where toxic agents are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian movement group said nearly 120,000 people had been killed since syria's civil war began nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons comes a day before the November 1 deadline.
The Hague-based organisation had set the target for Damascus to destroy or "render ineffective" all chemical weapons production units and machinery used to mix chemicals with toxic gases and fill munitions.
The completion of the initial phase of destruction, primarily, is a meaningful milestone in this ambitious development that aims to eliminate all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destroying the equipment means That Syria can no longer develop new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to destroy the weapons and collections that exist.
Syria is believed to have 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the announcement came as clashes escalated on Thursday in the city of Safira, which experts believe is home to a chemical weapons production unit as well as a storage facility.
The movement group, which keeps details of the death toll through the movement's network in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children, it said.
The government said 29,954 were members of President Bashar Assad's armed forces, 18,678 were government fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
It also said the dead included 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the U.N. It estimated that about 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated the figures since then.
About two million people have been forced to leave the country due to this conflict.
Assad's military contingent fought rebels in Safira for weeks, many of whom belonged to al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, the Observatory said there were casualties on both sides, but did not explicitly say anything.
This war reflects the threat faced by chemical weapons inspectors who, in a very short time-frame, have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war.
OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations. The statement said its team "is satisfied now and has confirmed – and seen – all of Syria's declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment – as destroyed." "
It also said, "No further inspection activity is being planned. "
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first phase of confirmation by visiting 21 of the 23 centres announced by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were not able to visit the two centres due to security reasons.
On Friday, O.P.C.W. According to Syria, these two centers have been "abandoned and... The chemical weapons product items kept there were transported to other declared centers, which have been inspected. "
It was not immediately clear whether the unit at Safira was one of the two centres where OPCW was located. The inspector was not able to leave.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which will be sent to the OPCW next month. To be approved by the Executive Committee.
In comments issued by OPCW, Ahmet Uzumku, Director General of the Monitoring Group, said, "I salute the perseverance and courage shown by you in accomplishing the most challenging mission this organization has ever undertaken. "
The three-year civil war is mainly a conflict between Assad's government and its security forces, including members of the Alawat, descendants of Shiite Islam, and rebel Sunni Muslims.
In a separate development, Observatory chief Rami Abdurrahman said there was a powerful explosion on Wednesday at an air defence centre in the Syrian coastal region of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is not yet known, he said.
In the Nortel patent case, financial lawsuits have been filed against Google, Samsung, Huawei.
The group, owned by thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent lawsuits on Thursday against cell phone makers including Google, which it overtook in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
A consortium called Rockstar, which bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, opened a U.S. patent in Texas. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. filed a patent infringement in the District Court. Ltd., H.T.C. The company has sued Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of infringing seven patents.
The patents also include technology that combines internet search terms with consistent advertising, which is a core part of Google's search business, the indictment said.
Samsung, Huawei, HTC Representatives for Rockstar could not be immediately reached.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC. All of them make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which is strongly competing with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google increased the bid several times, eventually offering $4.4 billion.
After losing to Rockstar in Nortel patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, largely because Motorola had a long list of patents.
The indictment said that "despite losing the bid to acquire patents-in-suite in the auction, Google has violated, and continues to infringe."
Rockstar has sought enhanced damages against Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement is malafide.
FAA: Aircraft passengers can now use gadgets in aircraft (but can't make calls from cell phones)
Airplane passengers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music — but won't be able to talk to their cellphones — from entering the gate to getting off the gate — under the highly-anticipated new guidelines released by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But travelers should not expect these changes immediately.
The FAA at a news conference. "How fast these changes are implemented will vary from airline to airline," said Michael Huarta, Administrator of The Indian Express.
The airlines have been given FAA. The company will have to demonstrate how their aircraft meet the new guidelines, and how they are updating the rules for collecting training manuals and devices of their crew members to reflect the guidelines.
The FAA has said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
"Depending on the status of the plan, we may approve the extended use of the electronic device very quickly," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the plane door is closed.
They are expected not to turn on the aircraft unless it reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and is permitted by the Captain.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again at the time of landing, and not turn it on until the plane is completely off.
"Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are fully protected from electronic disruption may allow their passengers to use the device while taking off, landing and taxiing," the FAA said.
Most of the new airline companies and other aircraft that have been modified in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, has welcomed these changes.
"When the policy is implemented safely – and we will work with airlines to make that happen – it will be a win-win situation for both sides," Glading said in a statement. "
We're bored of feeling like "hall monitors" when it comes to this issue.
But surfing by connecting to the internet at altitudes below 10,000 feet, exchanging emails, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data will still be prohibited, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
In 2011, actor Alec Baldwin was offloaded from a plane by American Airlines after he refused to turn off his device when he was playing on his smartphone while he was parked at the gate.
And heavy equipment such as laptops etc. will still have to be stored as they will be worried about injury to another person in the cabin due to their jumping.
Cellphone calls will also continue to be restricted during the flight.
The regulatory authority regarding phone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission, the FAA. Not near.
During the take-off and landing of the aircraft, the FAA was attacked. Restrictions on certain electronic devices may be lifted.
Last month, Mark Rosenken of the National Transportation Safety Board was appointed by the CBS. News, a national transportation safety expert, said cell phones are still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are a really serious issue, not just because they can potentially disrupt navigation-related devices, but also because they can disrupt cell phone towers when they're in the air," Rosenker said.
The FAA has been appointed to investigate the issue. Last month, an industry advisory committee set up by The Indian Space Research Organisation (IOCL) recommended that the government should allow greater use of personal electronic devices.
To reduce the ban on their use, the FAA has been formed. But the pressure has been increasing in recent years.
Seine. Critics such as Claire McCaskillk, D-Mo, have stated that there is no valid security reason for prohibition.
Enforcing these restrictions is becoming even more difficult because device use is ubiquitous.
Some studies also indicate that about a third of travelers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their device.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996, when passengers were using FM devices. There were reports of disruption of navigation and communication equipment due to carrying of radios and high technology gadgets of that time.
The new airlines are more dependent on electrical systems than the previous generation of aircraft, but they are also required to be supported by the FAA. Has been designed and approved to be resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes for many years.
Aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to disruption.
Huarta said most airlines must meet the eligibility criteria for increased use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Today's electronic devices emit radio transmissions of much less power than previous generation electronic devices.
E-readers, for example, have a nominal transmission during page turns.
But transmissions prevail when downloading or sending data by the device.
It has also been Amazon.com of those in favour of reducing restrictions on the use of the device by passengers.
In 2011, company officials loaded their entire Kindle e-readers into the airline and flew it to test for problems, but no such problems were found.
The FAA has been informed about the risks posed by the use of the device. The Advisory Committee has expressed mixed sentiments.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airborne Passengers Association said he believes the disruption caused by the device is real, even if the risk is negligible.
Other members of the committee said that, there are only reports described by the pilot in support of the device causing disruption to the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the members of the Committee recommended that the FAA should be implemented. Allow pilots to order passengers to switch off the device when the aircraft is landing in low visibility.
The travel industry group has welcomed the changes and called them a common knowledge facility for people travelling in the latest era of technology.
CEO of the U.S. Travel Association Roger Doe said, "We are happy that the FAA has been formed. It has recognized that a traveler traveling with joy is not incompatible with safety and security.

A recent media report said that the NSA stole information from Yahoo and Google's data centers for espionage.
The Washington Post has revealed this based on documents collected from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
According to the report, the NSA's program was called Muscular, which it ran in collaboration with its British counter-part- GCHQ.
The two agencies stole data passing through the vast fiber optic cable network laid by Yahoo and Google.
The Washington Post quoted a top secret document dated January 9, 2013, as saying that more than 180 million documents were collected in just three days of the program's launch.
These include email, text, audio and video messages.
According to the Washington Post, the program was run outside the US and an anonymous telecommunications provider helped the NSA access this information.
According to the newspaper, it was easier for the NSA to run this program outside the US, because court orders are required for such operations in the US.
"To the best of my knowledge, this has never happened," NSA Chief General Keith Alexander said during a press conference in Washington.
The NSA has always collected all the information within the scope of the law.
The NSA was recently targeted for spying on the German chancellor.
The United Nations said on Wednesday that the US administration has assured that its communications system will not be monitored.
The US has also said that the UN's communication system is not monitored.
To correct the seatback, gm The U.S. I called back pickup trucks.
On Friday, the U.S. According to a notice from auto safety regulators, General Motors Co. is all set to launch its brand new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC. Cera has recalled about 19,000 trucks to correct a shortfall in hand-rotating seatbacks in pickup trucks.
Some trucks may have a drawback in the front seat rotating system.
As a result the seatbacks failed to comply with union auto safety standards regarding head restraints.
According to a notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website, "If the vehicle is stuck from behind, the head restor may not be able to protect the driver properly, which will increase the risk of injury".
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM's trucks began shipping in June and, after the 2009 bankruptcy renewal, the top U.S. truck service began. This marks the most significant Wahhan launch for the automaker.
GM had informed the truck owners about the defect in late October.

Schools urge more focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students must read at least one Shakespearean play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and a contemporary British story from after 1914.
The exam will also include "unseen lessons" to encourage greater reading.
A combined English literature and language course will be abolished.
Since 2015, students will be given a separate GCSE in the language. There will be a lot of motivation to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Education Department will release the new syllabus for English and Mathematics tomorrow - both of which will be the first subjects to undergo a revolutionary change.
It will also change other main subjects next year.
In a separate move, the exam regulator has been able to implement the GCSE with a new grading system, and reduced syllabus. Will demonstrate the changes that take place in the structure.
Speaking in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said that "there was a lot of consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore people's confidence." It will be "more challenging, more ambitious and more tough".
Studies found that English schools devote less time to math – 116 hours a year or less – 3 hours a week during sessions than in most countries.
By comparison, Australian schools provide students with an average of 143 hours a year, compared to Singapore's average of 138 hours.
While there is no formal need to give more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that comprehensive mathematics is not a part of GCSE. - Combining overweight with subjects in the league table was likely to encourage providing additional teaching in schools.
This course will focus more on "real-world problems" including financial mathematics.
Disputes over seat width have led to large orders from jet manufacturers at stake.
There has been a race for this month's Dubai Airshow, setting the tone for fights between leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long-haul flights.
The controversy centers on economy class seat widths on long-haul flights, not as always offered by airlines, but whose allotted space efficiency has been claimed by the latest Jet Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. to be key.
Airbus expects this week to provide an industry standard of at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide seats in economy cabins, but it should be decided by the airlines, its main rival Boeing says.
The dispute between aircraft manufacturers comes after a race to sell a larger version of the twin engines of the long-range aircraft from a possible recorded order after the 17-21 incident.
How is the rear of the aircraft built - especially whether the seating is equal to 9 or 10.
Boeing says it has built a "777X" that will hold 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 people in a row in the economic department.
Airbus says that competing with the A350, it will carry 350 people in 9 equal seats left 18 inches.
Aircraft giants often strike trade issues through advertisements in the business press.
Now, with the Airbus 777X expected to dominate more than 100 orders in Dubai Airshow, it is further appealing to the public.
Recently it is being seen that whatever the beginning of the Vigilance War, will you accept this together in a restaurant by showing Finnero that the three of them together?
"Boeing is offering long-haul flight in narrowseats, even from regional turbos," Said John Leahy, Airbus sales chief.
As a change, people may be getting bigger, but the way the plane sits has not changed.
According to U.S. Department of Health data, between the 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance travel, the average 40-49-year-old American male gained 10 percent of his weight by 10 percent between the end of the century.
According to U.S. Health Statistics, the average American male has a waist of 39.7 inches in the 21st century.
Airbus says its rival sticks to a seat concept from the 1950s when the average circumference of the new name "Jet Set" was narrow.
Airbus says it has set up a research commission that suggests an extra inch of seat width improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputed Airbus' seat measurement figures, saying it was not up to manufacturers deciding how airlines strike a balance between fares and facilities.
It also says, research shows that the width of a seat depends more on the experience of the cabin.
Boeing cabin expert Kent Kraver said. It really gives airlines flexibility and believes in what they need to do to succeed. "
"They don't want to tell us what they benefit from."
They know their business better than anyone else.
For flyers it's about elbow room, but for suppliers it's increasingly an issue that it can affect income.
The competition for aircraft orders is enough, in the coming decades, to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports.
A Reuters report reported for the first time in July, whether seat layouts are actually a fighting issue between new jets.
Airbus and Boeing claimed to have 20 percent efficiency per seat compared to the 365-seat Boeing 777-300 Er, the leader in that segment, in their new twin-engine design.
Boeing's performance claim relies on the 10-year-old 777 X One comparison with the original 9-year-old 777 design.
The 10 equivalents with gains in unit cost are now comparable.
Kevin Kenniston, Head of Airbus Passenger Facility for Europe, says "Boeing is doing it to make their aircraft more competitive with our products, and to occupy more seats".
On the other hand, analysts say the entire 10-seat-per-row cabin for the current 777s suggests that many passengers favor the Denser layout, which can go with cheaper fares as well.
"The eighteen-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that this trade point of Airbus is driven by the threat of Proposition 777," said cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list for airlines to choose from suppliers.
Jet vendors around the world should also take careful measures to check on this layout competition.
While taking more comfort, all builders are also offering low-cost jets and high-density layouts for regional travel.
Airbus is giving a 10 equivalent A350 but says it has not been sold yet.
Until recently, Airbus insisted on wider cabin seats on some of its jets to require more cabin comfort.
Modern jets are unlikely to fly to a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturers, but it could distract from the 777X sales wave.

Premature puberty: growing up early
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls attain puberty at a younger age than white girls of their age.
Physical change does not mean that puberty is imminent.
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemical can be blamed.
Experts believe that obesity outbreaks may be a cause of puberty at an early age
The case of premature puberty is not as effective in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is an expert journalist in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter starts developing breasts and producing genital hair at the age of 7 or 8?
At the American Academy of Pediatrics' annual conference in Orlando, Florida this week, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplowitz clarified that these early physical changes are common among American girls, reflecting a new trend.
"I spend a lot of time convincing parents — that it generally doesn't reflect rapid progress toward full puberty," says Caplowitz. "
Direct signs of development such as sprouting of breasts, genital and feather hair and body odor are showing prematurely in girls.
But in the last four decades, there has been a very slight change in the age of Rajodarshan (first menstrual period).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, up from 12.75 in 1970.
"It takes at least two to three years for the first menopause when breasts begin to develop," explains Kaplowitz, who is "Premature puberty in girls: the essential guide to dealing with this common problem." "I'm also the author.
The most accurate test of the development of puberty is time.
There is debate about what is the onset of puberty, but when there is an increase with breast development before the age of 8, two call it "child-mature."
In most cases this process will slow down or stop - which the pediatrician can observe closely.
In the event of rapid progression, an examination by an endocrinologist may be required to rule out the possibility of serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
Treatments to delay premature menstruation and other outcomes are: premature aging of bones, which can lead to stunted growth and premature growth as an adult.
Recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on the child's age, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional adulthood.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is conscious of drugs but admits, "Suppressing puberty can increase behavioral issues, and girls may start to feel isolated from their peers." "
The second big problem is understandable: parents simply don't want their young daughter to menstruate.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain hygiene," Caplowitz said. "
A woman, whose daughter started menstruating at the age of 10, recalls, "It was a shock. ’
Though there were symptoms and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She returned from her school scared and upset that she was the first to start menstruating among her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence to suggest that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexually explicit messages in the media can be alleged.
Boys – just like girls – are attaining premature puberty.
Caplowitz dictates that the main cause is an outbreak of obesity.
She helped conduct a study on girls aged 6 to 9 in 2001, which links body fat with the timing of puberty.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls have a tendency to attain puberty earlier than white girls of their age.
There are many explanations for this.
Globally, the pattern of premature puberty appears to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to weather and genes.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting facial and genital hair at an early age, the trend of full puberty is not as clear as that of girls.
Other practitioners who attended the AAP conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even acne and genital hair have become common in infants and children.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty," says Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey. "
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their pediatrician to seek an opinion on how to talk to their children.
"This could mean negotiating ahead of the expected time," Kaplowitz advised. "
If you stay calm, your child will usually respond properly.
Girls who develop prematurely need to be assured that even if it is happening prematurely, it is part of normal life.

Tripodi denies being influenced by Obid.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Trippody will be investigated by a State Corruption Watchdog.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi has refused to deny the policy of sea leases at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obid, a former New South Wales patriarch who had a hidden interest in three government-controlled lands.
The Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday detailed the investigation into whether Mr. Obaid lobbied several ministers of state for violating the circulars of the lease policy. Where two restaurants and cafes owned by Obaid were renewed without tender after their expiration in August 2005.
Following evidence provided thursday by Lynn Ashpole, former deputy chief of staff, it was alleged that Mr. Tripodi knew Mr. Obid's hidden interests? It is now being investigated.
During years of discussions in 2005, the government had pressed for public tenders for leases.
The lessors were against this and wanted more time.
In 2009, Circular Enterprises for leases, from which Obaid earned $25 million annually, was renewed without a tender without leases.
Mr. Tripathi, who was minister for dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of a public tender.
But he refused to change at Mr. Obid's request, Mr. Tripodi had urged a change in the government lease policy.
A transcript of phone calls presented in ICAC in August and September 2007 was made by Mr. Obaid and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to Mr. Obid's fisheries department after working at the Ministry of Ports
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr. Tripodi. "Was the development of the commercial lease policy being discussed in the telephone conversation of the case?"
"No," Mr. Tripod replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obid.

Outrage over conviction of bali bombing plotter
The families and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 bomb blasts have expressed outrage over the punishment given to the perpetrator of the bomb blast, saying that Umar Patek should face the firing team.
Patek, who ran on the run for nearly 10 years as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in manufacturing the explosive device used in the bombing.
If granted parole, he can be released in 15 years.
Omar, 45, was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injuring scores of others.
He was also found guilty of several other terrorism-related charges, including a series of church bombings in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors had sought a life sentence, although they could also demand that the man, infamous as the master of the bomb-making, be called the death penalty.
The decision brought back painful memories of Perth-based woman June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and his co-conspirators a decade ago.
Holding back his tears, he said Patek should have been given the death penalty.
I really feel that he should have been punished like other dreaded terrorists.
Ms. Courtin called A.A.P. "He should be made to stand in front of the firing team. "
I have to live every day without my grandchildren and my daughters.
On October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 pm, the club was wiped out after a bomb loaded into a van parked outside The Sari Club exploded.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddies bar when the suicide bombers detonated a backpack full of explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He slipped into a month-long coma as a result of the bombing and "died" three times while on life-saving equipment.
Mr. Hughes says Patek should have received the same punishment as the three other members of the Jemmah Islamiyah terrorist group responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Mukhalas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this person should be executed before anyone else.
There is no reason to keep him alive, see, to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and injuring innumerable people, getting a sentence of 20 years is not enough.
Patek is the last person to be convicted of the Bali bomb blasts.
He avoided being caught for nearly a decade, but was eventually arrested in January 2011, in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the U.S. The military killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI The agent had submitted evidence that the report showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to reestablish contact between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't surrender," says Ms. Courtin. "
Even today, she doesn't really have the pain of inflicting mental agony on so many people.
The decision, this year, comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," Ms. Courtin said. "
Patek can still appeal against his penalty.
When the hotel staff protested, they started assaulting them.
Rk Singh, the younger brother of the hotel owner, who came to the rescue, was manhandled by the son of an inebriated MP.
Meanwhile, many more people came there.
When he tried to catch the young man, he opened fire with a revolver.
The firing caused a sensation in the area.
At this, the hotel staff caught him and called the police.
Hotel owner Munna Singh, who reached the police station, lodged a complaint against Anand Pandey, son of MP Gorakhnath Pandey, a resident of Berwa Paharpur under Koirana police station of Bhadohi district.
On which the police arrested Anand and seized the revolver.
According to Handia Inspector Ashok Saraswat, Munna Singh, a resident of Khabhor in Pratapgarh, runs a hotel called Raag Darbar on the National Highway.
At around 8 pm, Anand Pandey reached the hotel and ordered food.
When there was a delay in preparing food, he started abusing, assaulting and firing.
Anand was under the influence of alcohol and also threatened to kill the hotel staff.
The inspector says that the hotel is near Bhiti village and adjacent to Bhadohi district.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer jailed for giving secret information about police investigation to Mr. Big
Basharat Ditta, 42, used to pass on information to notorious criminal Neil Scarborough.
The lawyer thought that people could find out about his confidential drug addiction
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
The defense's top lawyer, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation because he feared people would find out about his secret drug addiction, has been sentenced to three years in prison.
Barashat Ditta, 42, used to provide sensitive confidential information about the investigation of his drug trafficking activities to notorious criminal Neil Scarborough, after settling with his cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash", praised by criminals as a "top brief", was arrested in 2011 from his home after a police surveillance operation in Scarborough, which he had represented at a previous narcotics trial.
Officers spotted 32-year-old Scarborough carrying three bags of cocaine at a lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out for a Law Society dinner with his co-workers.
After cocaine particles were found in Ditta's hair, his wallet, and his credit card, investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular user" of the Class A drug.
During the eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to illegally obtain information about the arrest of two people on behalf of Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were being monitored by police at the time as part of the main investigation into the heroine and cocaine syndicate operating in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 other men who were jailed after police seized 1.5 million pounds worth of heroin and cocaine, and more than 200,000 pounds in cash during multiple raids.
Ditta, 42, used to provide information to criminals because he feared that people would not know about his cocaine addiction.
Ditta, who works at law firm Forbes Solicitors based in Blackbarard, was facing failure at Liverpool Crown Court today after pleading guilty to two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.
He had admitted to possessing cocaine at an earlier hearing.
The lawyer's rough days began when, while investigating Scarborough, police discovered that he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and saw him coming into Ditta's house and placing a drug of more than 60 percent purity under the lawyer's bin in a black golf glove.
After being drugged, Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta, who had gone out for dinner at Blackrn Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
On reaching home, the lawyer found out that the drug was stored there and there were nine communication between them.
The court heard that Ditta was found to be a "regular user" of cocaine after tests found traces of a category A drug on his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, saying he was talking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and said their discussions were a matter of "legal privilege."
During his arrest, Ditta took out his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were confiscated, and his hair sample was taken.
In the police interview, he said that he ran the office from his work place as well as from his home, and that his clients used to call his house for legal matters.
After the main persons arrested told what the detectives knew about them, the court told the hearing that Ditta used to make calls to key people in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously presented.
Annie White, on behalf of the prosecution, said that: "The criminal lawyer should be best aware of not breaking the law. "
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal advocate, engaging too much with his specific client.
We are not talking about the relationship of the usual drug dealer, but about a dealer who is providing drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations must have certainly been legal without a doubt, as he was a lawyer.
But he went far beyond his limits of the lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed, as much as possible, the police investigation so that they remained able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was not respecting his profession, but insulting it.
He developed a great deal of closeness to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to provide Mr. Scarborough with information, I would not have waited for 15 hours, rather I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said: "Mr. Ditta transformed himself from a criminal advocate to a criminal at the time he began receiving drugs from organized criminals. "
Due to his cocaine addiction, he highly compromised and became very vulnerable to the objectives of leading members of organized crime groups, who used it to obtain important information related to police investigations.
Advocates should maintain the highest standard of integrity, and instill confidence and confidence in the people.
Mr. Ditta has betrayed this belief and tried to escape under the guise of his profession.
Mr. Ditta was investigated by Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit, which found him guilty of three counts of possession of cocaine and now obstructing justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing the perpetrators to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to criminals that no person is out of the reach of the law.
We will find you and present you before the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other members of the gang were sentenced to prison for a total of 153 years for drug offenses.
On her website, Ditta gave a question and answer session about herself, in which she said her fantasy job would be to be a lawyer for a client on death row in the US, to have Mohammed Ali as her dinner guest and Inequality to be the inspiration for her work.
Bombardier's profits fall as aircraft deliveries, orders fall
Canadian airplane and train maker Bombardier Inc. reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, in its train unit in the third quarter and as pressure from lower aircraft orders and deliveries over contract issues.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not present an update on the issues its brand new CSeries aircraft will release any flight test data or meet its ambitious program of going into commercial service from next September.
Another half month after the first flight of the test aircraft, it has been flown just three times, raising the question of whether the test phase is on track or not.
The results fell less than forecast and the stock sent for sliding more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered his rating to "sector performance" from "beat" on Thursday to limit the stock is up during the next one or two quarters.
"While weak aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed by margin performance in transportation," Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive new orders for Bombardier CSeries as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, doubts that the market will be apprehensive of the program.
Bombardier hopes the aircraft family can now cut it to the low end of a market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and was flown for the first time in September after months of delays.
Potential buyers wait for flight test results to validate the company's claims about the new jetliner fuel efficiency and potential cost savings but as confirmed orders for CSeries are up to 177.
There are 403 complete orders and commitments available with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Boudouin was confident that Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the jet was first put into commercial use.
Officials assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the event was going on as per schedule.
"The test aircraft stayed on land longer than anticipated," Boudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft's interval.
Each producer creates schedules in a different way.
We had decided to do a first flight and do an updated period and that's what we did.
That will be all through the flight program.
The second remaining part of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the following shortly afterwards, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical that customers can start operating a CSeries aircraft after its first flight in the first 12 months.
Bombardier has said it will evaluate the Schedule in Admissions (EIS) and provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing – although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be pushed to Q1/15," Dorsen said.
For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million a year earlier, or 8 cents per share, to $172 million, or 9 cents per share.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue slumped marginally to $4.1 billion from $4.2 billion.
According to analysts Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, 10 cents per share and $4.56 billion in revenue earnings were expected.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft maker said 45 aircraft were delivered during the quarter, down from 57 a year ago.
Net orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion as of September 30, no change from December 31.
"In aerospace, the results were in line with our guidance, but the low-order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment," Boudoin said.
Aerospace revenue slumped 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier said the division, the world's largest train manufacturer, had increased nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion in revenue.
The order backlog in the transport unit were $32.6 billion of approximately September 30, up marginally from December 31.
Some large contracts in the margins of the transport division were also affected by execution issues.
Executives said the new guidance will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, in which Google Inc. Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichet announced the board's joining, were also down 8.5 percent at C$4.83 in mid-afternoon trading on Thursday.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft maker and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Parents of intersex kids can choose their children's 'gender undetermined'
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to recognise the third gender for babies born with ambiguous genitalia.
Now newborn babies will not be traditionally designated male or female.
The new law does not require parents to declare gender for such children, allowing them to declare gender as 'undetermined' or "unspecified" on the child's birth certificate.
The new law aims to reduce pressure on parents who can make hasty decisions regarding sex-specific surgeries for newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex children.
According to the BBC, an intersex man said years later, "I am neither male nor female." "
I will remain a wounded, stained bandage made by the doctors.
It is estimated that one in every 2,000 children is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the investigation of disorders of sexual development, a collective term used for abnormal chromosomes, genitourinary (ovaries or testes), or abnormally developed penis.
Maybe Wallis Simpson has been intersex.
Gender identity is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when sex determination cannot be done, it is better to use the best information available to specify gender and observe the child's psychological and physical development before undergoing surgery, if such a situation occurs.
New York City psychologist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-identity matters, said Germany's new law "appears to be a good thing." "
Intersex children create moral confusion.
"Some people are in a life-threatening situation that requires surgery, but that is not the case with most children. "
You can specify the gender without surgery, and then see how the identity develops.
The science of knowing how a penis will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No one can give a proper answer as to why this happens.
It's a kind of puzzle as to why people are gay.
A report filed before the European Commission in 2011 describes intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not related to gender but to their biological composition, which is neither clearly male nor female, but is either a combination of the two or neither is clearly defined. It was.
These characteristics may manifest themselves as secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breasts and length; Primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals; Or in chromosomal structure and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in the field of jobs, as well as harassment, violence and discrimination crimes.
There are now special camps for boys with non-conforming genders.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to mark male, female or "third gender" on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Nori May-Welby became the world's first recognized "genderless" person after winning a legal appeal to have life-long "unspecified" gender status.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the German passport will also have a third specification as X for intersex persons in addition to M or F.
According to the news report on France 24, issues related to gender in neighboring France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country signed a petition calling for the "gender doctrine" to be withdrawn from school books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed germany's law, saying, "While the world is moving to a stage where gender is a self-chosen choice, but not sexual activity, we are moving two more pillars of civilization in the opposite direction." "
The mother of the newborn in Maryland also told Baby Joan that she would love to see the babies assigned gender at birth.
"Parenting without additional boundaries is very stressful, especially if you don't even know what your child's gender is," she said on the website about parenting. "
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, babies born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites (bisexuals), named after the handsome Greek god who was bisexual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world regarded gender as a slate that could be erased and then written down.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, understanding that gender identity is a complex task, and sometimes even physicians who don't know what children will feel about their gender specification as they grow up.
"In the mid-twentieth century, we used to call it a "psychiatric emergency," says Drescher.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The existing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitalia was presented by Dr. John Money of John Hopkins University, who considered gender to be deconstructional.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues – how parents raise a child – interact with a child's genes and hormones to determine whether to identify him or her as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/Joan", their theories became disputed.
He advised the parents of a child whose penis had accidentally gone to the penis during a circumcision to get the child's testicles removed and raise him like a girl.
"Mani presented that case as a successful case of transfer, but that didn't happen," Drescher said. "
At the age of 15, the child turned himself back into a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said there are still some physicians "following the same pattern."
But with the advent of the internet in the years after 1990, individuals undergoing these gender surgeries began to emerge "not happy with the outcome".
Similar was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was a writer from X.Y. The male was born with a chromosome, but his genitalia was unclear.
The physicians clearly didn't understand whether his penis was small, or that his clitoris was large, but they were certain that he could never live a "satisfied life" as a man.
So shortly after her birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and testicles were surgically removed and she was raised like a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
She told ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl. "
I wasn't happy, but it was very hard to question.
At the age of 18, she was about to have a vaginoplasty.
But feeling depressed and something amiss, she asked for medical records.
This made him realize the frightening truth.
I was tied up at birth — and no one ever told me.
Bruce is a D.S.D. She was born with a baby girl, which prevented her body from making enough testosterone, due to which her genitals could not develop properly.
After knowing the truth, he became a man again, took testosterone supplements and had his breasts removed.
He became infertile due to surgery.
Today, he convinces people to normalize their perception of intersex individuals in an organization called the Interface Project.
However, Anne Tamer-Mattis, executive director of California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, expresses concern that German law "invites chippeness and stigma." "
"Many activists think that German law will prompt parents to make quick decisions and specify the child "undetermined," she says. "
We fear this will encourage intervention.
We think that instead of waiting, specifying male or female gender is a better process.
But we don't know how the law will play its role, so we can only speculate.
Tamer-Mattis said her organisation supports Australian law because "it allows adults to be identified in the third gender." "
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender," he said. "
German law deals with specifying it at the time of birth.
This is not a war fought by newborns at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions related to their body.
But Pittsburgh-based breast radiologist Dr. Erlene Baratz, whose daughter has a sexual growth disorder, and who supports hundreds of others in a support group, said German law would "give both parents and children the power." "
Baratji's daughter Katy was born with male chromosomes, but was diagnosed with a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. It was.
Since she had a defect in her androgen receptor, Katy developed female traits.
She has a vagina in her body but no uterus or ovary.
Katy, now 29, is married and a resident in the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a mother through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"This law allows parents not to make hasty decisions on their own," Baratz said. "
It gives them time to understand and time appropriately by some testing before writing 'male' or 'female'.
In this way, you stay fine - raise the child, love the child.
You have a cute baby and enjoy it.
We don't need to have a surgery in a hurry that can't be reversed.
"It brings children into the decision-making process and frees parents from the anxiety that motivates them because they don't believe they are doing well," he said. "
Ultimately, the child will determine which gender he is more comfortable with - and that would be great.
It enables children to make decisions for their own sake.
A beautiful expression was presented in line with the plot 'Ek Aur Dronacharya' showing harmony in the Dwapar era and today's circumstances.
It was shown that in today's context, a guru is forced to walk on the wrong path by tying him in which shackles.
The play was inaugurated jointly by MLA Prabhudayal Valmiki, Vice-President of Cantonment Council Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh in the auditorium of St. Joseph's Inter College.
The play depicted the similarity of the circumstances of Dronacharya of the Dwapar era and Arvind, a professor at present.
Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Bechain, Hemant Goyal, Seema Samar, Vanshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Ghazala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun etc. performed great justice to the characters.
The play was lighting by young theatre personality Jitendra C. Raj and the set was designed by Hemant Kumar.
After this, various awards were given to the personalities who made literary and cultural contributions on behalf of APTA at the ceremony.
Dr Aslam Jamshedpur, head of the Urdu department of Charan Singh University, senior journalist Shambhunath Shukla and theatre personality Jitendra C. Raj were given the award.
Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi etc. contributed to making the event successful.
Clive Palmer claimed that the PM had a letter about the parental leave scheme. Tony Abbott's conflict of interest
Billionaire M.P. Clive Palmer has said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave scheme because his daughters can get pregnant and take advantage of it.
The mining tycoon, who has been at loggerheads over the payment of a $6 million carbon tax bill, has made the claim, while attempting to answer questions about the conflict.
Palmer United can control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in determining whether to reduce carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only ministers can have a conflict of interest, and said that mr. Abbott's daughters can benefit personally from the policies.
Mr. "They may have a significant interest conflict in terms of paid parental leave, because if any of their daughters become pregnant, they will have a direct interest in whether or not they get leave," Palmer said. "
Two months after the election, the Election Commission officially appointed Mr. Palmer was declared the winner of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a revamp of the election count to speed up the process.
Tony Aot's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should the result of the election come two months after we voted?
"We should have a better system. "
Why can't we have a system in which we fill in our details on the computer, vote instantly and we have the result at 6:30 in the evening.
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
Is it because if a person does not like it, can he erase it?
In today's era, using pencils seems absolutely absurd.
The Election Commission is studying the options for electronic voting and has recently released a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
The 59-year-old Mr. Palmer said his policies included building an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and that he would take his new assignment "very seriously."
Public office is for public service.
"We don't need any award other than the prize of history that we can serve the community at this crucial time. "
George Kerevan: Euro dissolution gave Scots a choice
Another day, another story of fear of freedom.
This time we have been warned that the EU will be in power. Independent Scotland would be required to join as an independent travel zone throughout Europe as a condition of membership of the Independent Scotland.
Passport control over Barwick and Hadrian's walls indicate stories about the extent of barbed wire.
The truth is that the Strathclyde paper described about the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although – predictably – it was not described in the headlines.
Nor did anyone describe what the EU was doing. Members spend most of their time changing their formal rules as needed.
Since Scotland is no longer a Schengen area, continuing non-compliance would be cheaper discounts for Brussels in exchange for getting what it actually wants from Scotland.
So, then, the non-story.
And the thing that has been stuck for so long has been frozen. The first time I heard the baseless news "freedom means passport control" was about 40 years ago.
Yet the interesting point was lost in retelling this interesting old story.
Why should we expect independent Scotland to bid for Europe?
Why buy and sell London yoke for Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the great, post-war plan to organize Europe has finally stalled.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
The whole of the European Union. In the U.S. Parties dedicated to opposing the U.S. or closing the euro as a common currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded only this year – suddenly came and won nearly five million votes in the September federal election, effectively excluding the Free Democrats (the equivalent of our own Lib Dems) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
But, the current economic crisis proved to be radically transformative.
The stringent regulations imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, as well as the constraints imposed on national economies through complying with the same currency, have led many to think that Project Europe has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro did not have much role in the excessive budget deficits of national governments - this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system stabilized the currency exchange rate in favor of its members German exporters – something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of a domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself in a position with an inherent loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce salaries and public expenditure – encouraged by Berlin.
Far beyond the current budget and currency problems, there is a deep European productivity malaise.
As a result of the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels – to provide discounts to French and German energy firms on consumers' spending – European industries pay twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United Nations.
This is a crippling cost loss that we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wages in the world have been frozen, too, to make the European petrochemicals industry cheaper in the U.S. Can't avoid being affected by shale gas.
As a result, there is a sense of rebellion among the people, especially in France, which was once a part of the EU. I was a big fan.
After the war, France's top politicians left the EU. He saw Paris as a way to control Germany, and to provide billing equal to Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy, and it has imposed its own economic policies on Europe, causing France's economy to falter.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, the EU. The opposition National Front has won the recently held by-election, pushing the ruling Socialist to the third position.
The Front is currently the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning to British Labour that they cannot assume that disintegration for the left will automatically benefit the right.
What is Le Pen doing with her newly found fame among French whites, the working class?
The team is scheduled to meet next year's EU summit. Elections are used in the European Parliament in the EU. The opponent wants to form an anti-currency faction.
If, as is very likely, in these elections, the EU will be able to vote If the opposition parties do well, then this type of faction can affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My view is this: soon the EU will be in Europe. The confluence of anti-currency and anti-currency sentiment will destroy the euro.
The euro will not be completely wiped out, but it will return to some form like a "Europe of (sovereign) nations" backed by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its subsidiary economies can keep the euro, but France and Southern Europe will restart their currencies.
I expect the U.K. to grow closer to the U.S. Keep yourself away from this project.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all this?
We can (necessarily) choose to remain the territory of Little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can perform better in a loose European system, provided we have our own currency.
It will be easier for non-federal nations to work together with other like-minded countries in Europe.
Otherwise we should think about maintaining our economic independence while following the path of Norway.
SNP in Scotland The government has – notably – been the most successful anti-austerity political campaign in Europe, winning a surprising majority in 2011 based on the Tory-Lib Dam coalition opposing (and implementing) cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, because in that case it would have to accept the rules of austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
So you thought travel agents were of the past century, thank the internet?
The flight center is carrying forward this trend.
The company has increased its full-year profit forecast, and is expecting record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.

The water rail had become healthy and fit before it was released.
Nita Ambani, wife of India's biggest businessman Mukesh Ambani, is celebrating her 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
Nita is not celebrating her birthday in Mumbai but in Jodhpur.
He organized a very big party on this occasion.
Many big stars of Bollywood reached Jodhpur to attend this party. On the late evening of October 31, many big stars were seen catching a flight to Jodhpur at Mumbai airport.
These stars include Karisma Kapoor, Geeta Basra, Vinod Khanna and his wife Kavita Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapur, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahul Bose etc.
Obviously, when such big names join the party, you can imagine how big this procession will be.
According to this report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore during the last four years to celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
In fact, contrary to Modi's claims, there was a time during the NDA regime (between 1999 and 2004) during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's tenure as PM that no advertisement was issued by the government on Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002).
Laying the foundation stone of the 182-metre tall 'Statue of Unity' statue of Sardar Patel at Kevadiya in Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, "Earlier, there was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
DAVP records show that the UPA spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel's advertisements.
When Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari was asked about Modi's claims, he said that BJP's PM candidate does not talk on the basis of facts.
The UPA could not bring out any advertisement on Patel in 2008.
Tiwari said that this happened due to the economic slowdown that year.
However, the amount spent on advertisements of Sardar Patel is much less than the amount spent on the birth and death anniversaries of members of the Nehru-Gandhi family every year.
DAVP spent Rs 33 crore on print advertisements for the birth and death anniversaries of Mahatma Gandhi, Rs 21 crore for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, Rs 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru.
When asked about the difference, Tewari said, "It should not be seen from the point of view of spending on advertising.
Because the price of advertising depends on many things, including things like the size of the ad or the rate of advertising for that year.
The real thing is that it shows our dedication, which those opposing are trying to take over the legacy of a great leader without knowing about it.

Supreme Court upholds Obama healthcare law
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. The Supreme Court today declared the healthcare law named after Barack Obama as constitutional.
By a 5-4 vote, the judges ruled in favor of a separate order of the Patient Safety and Affordable Care Act that would require citizens to buy or penalize health insurance before 2014 – that it was constitutional within the government's power to impose taxes.
Chief Justice John Robert supported four other moderate members of the court, while other judges Scalia, Thauss, Alito and Kennedy disagreed.
The court also upheld the remaining articles of the 2,700-page law, saying that the healthcare law's condition that states increase Medicaid eligibility or that they will lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutionally coercive.
The petition was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Businesses to stop this law.
During the initial session of 2012, the law was opposed by all major Republican presidential candidates, including projected nominee Mitt Rumney.
Australian woman appeals against Thai imprisonment
A 21-year-old Sydney woman has been sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely accusing a taxi driver of assault, she has appealed the decision and has been granted bail.
On June 15, Phuket Provincial Court found Stevie Rochelle Baumford guilty of falsely accusing Thai police of falsely accusing her of attempting to stop her along with two other men on the morning of Sunday 10 June.
But later the CCTV was installed. The footage showed that she had safely returned to the hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
When Bamfort was questioned by Phuket police for two days, he admitted to fabricating the story.
He was kept in a local police cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a low-security detention center on the outskirts of Phuket instead of a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunx, who has requested the Foreign Affairs Department in Canberra to assist her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the entire family was "extremely concerned" about their daughter's care and wanted to bring her back to Australia.
"Undoubtedly it has been a worrying time for us, but we hope she will be back home as soon as possible. "
Bamphod has appealed against the sentence order, and has been granted bail on 50,000 baht.
Meanwhile, in Australia, the report said that she was holidaying at Kraby's holiday spot in southern Thailand.
Thailand-based legal sources said Bamford's case was being fought by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that as a result of the appeal, the court could increase his sentence to two years and force him to remain in an adult prison.
After the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be exonerated in an attempt to improve its poor tourist image.
Snow Den ready to "cooperate" with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snow Dane, a US intelligence informant, has declared that he is ready to travel to Berlin to give evidence to Parliament in German if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to respond to their activities.
German M.P. Hans Christian Straw Belle met Mr. Snow Dane on Thursday in Russia, where he has been granted asylum to talk about testimony in Germany.
In a letter presented by Mr. Snow Den to the media in Berlin on Friday, the MP said: "While the results of my efforts are verifiably positive, my government treats dissent as defections, and provides no defense that attempts to criminalize political speech with felony charges."
However, speaking the truth has not been a crime.
In the letter, Mr Snow Dane said he believed he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to drop the criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the US Department of Justice include theft of intelligence and government property.
Hans Peter Friedrich, the German interior minister, told Zeit online: "Mr. Snow Den has been willing to talk to the German authorities, so we have to find ways to make it possible."
Relations between the US and Germany have come under pressure after claims that the NSA had bugged Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, mp who is the chairman of the parliamentary committee, oversees intelligence. He said that even if Mr. Snow Danes had the opportunity to listen as a witness "without completely ruining relations with America and bringing them into danger," it should still be taken.
Mr. Straw Belle, a Member of Parliament from Germany's Green Party, published a photo of himself with Mr. Snow Den on Twitter feed.
He was on his trip to Russia with two German journalists.
Mr. Bellane said that, according to the former NSA contractor lawyer, Snow Den will not be able to go back to Russia if he left Russia.
If Snow Dane testified in Germany he would be "safe" there with the assurances that would be required, the lawmaker said.
Mr. Snow Den said in his letter that he had to "face a fierce and sustained campaign" for which he was forced to leave the house.
He, however, said he was happy and overwhelmed by the widespread reactions to his act of political expression "towards his act of political expression."
World citizens as well as high officials – including the United States – have judged the revelation of an irresponsible system of widespread surveillance of a public service.
The letter expands a proposal to cooperate with German authorities "when the problems of the humanitarian situation have been resolved."
Killing mosquitoes is going to be expensive to avoid diseases like dengue, malaria, filariasis.
The state government is going to triple the tax on repellent, mats, liquid used to kill mosquitoes.
The proposal to increase the tax will be placed before the Cabinet soon.
The government, which is struggling with financial crisis, is looking for every possible way to increase earnings these days.
It is worth mentioning that the resource committee is formed under the chairmanship of Urban Development Minister Mohammad Azam Khan to improve the financial health of the government.
According to sources, in the recent resource committee meeting, out of many proposals for increasing taxes, the committee rejected them, whose implementation would have a direct impact on the general public.
However, the committee has given the green signal to the proposal to increase the tax on mosquito repellents, coils, mats and liquids.
There is a proposal to triple the tax on these.
At present, there is four percent VAT and one percent additional tax on them.
Now 12.50 percent VAT and 1.50 percent additional tax is proposed on them.
The government is estimated to get an additional revenue of about Rs 14 crore from this.
Although the commercial tax department has been in favor of increasing the tax on tendu leaves from 5 percent to 14 percent to increase tax revenue income, the Financial Resources Committee has rejected the proposal.
The committee believes that tendu leaves are used to make the beedi that the lower strata people drink.
Similarly, the committee has not given the green signal to increase the tax on electrical goods like transmission wire, etc. at the moment, saying that it can affect the general public due to the increase in electricity prices.
The proposal to impose green tax on renewal of commercial vehicles has also not been accepted by the committee.

Gazprom's Alexei Miller described the pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new era
The head of Gazprom said the start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marked the start of Europe's largest energy projects.
"Today is a historic event: construction began on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest-scale and most important project in Europe. Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a core element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream will diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
Officials said that in Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas for Europe is produced, a dispute over the contract between Gazprom's counterpart and Gazprom presents a risk to traditional routes.
Miller said a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant the "perpetual" elimination of gambling geopolitical risks associated with transit countries.
After the entire project commences operations in 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Report: Reflections on the Biden Dumping Obama Campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, close advisers to President Barack Obama secretly considered Hillary Clinton to replace Biden for the vice presidential ticket for 2012.
The most notable of the revelations is the heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tom, "Double Down: Change the Game 2012" by Mark Halperin and John Helleman.
The Times obtained a copy of the upcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the president's top advisers held "extensive group-sessions and voting in late 2011" to find out if dumping Biden could help boost Obama's declining hopes of re-election.
According to Times National Political Correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book gives full details of the chief executives' efforts in the campaign and the White House, naming former White House staff chief Bill Put, to find out how former Secretary Clinton's transition from vice president to vice president affects the poll.
The potential switch was a very safe secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers to the president — including Dale, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Pallouffe — knew the change was under consideration.
The "double down" claims that Dale attempted to replace Biden despite his personal rapport before finally making a decision when his information suggested that Clinton's ticket would not improve Obama's situation.
In an interview with Martin, Dale has confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Clinton with Biden.
"I said keeping an eye on the whole scene, and one of them, this was it," Dale told the newspaper.
You remember that the presidency was in danger at that time, so we were in a situation like, "Holy Christ, what else will we do?"
While Dale described the research as a "caution," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made a significant investment in figuring out how much dividend this claim would pay if the poll was held.
"Campaigns don't spend money on voting and focusing groups like that unless they're seriously considering something," Martin said on AC360.
It's unclear, though, whether Obama knew his team was looking for change.
Martin told CNN that he asked Dale if his boss was aware of a possible reshuffle.
While Daley said he "didn't think the president was aware of a possible change," the former chief of staff admitted it was "possible" that Obama knew it.
"Double down" certain: Won't answer whether the political investigation reached Obama's desk? Martin said more.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn't know about Biden dumping ticket research.
"Probably," Martin said.
Today he will meet the families of those killed in the Patna rally last Sunday.
A week after the blast, tight security arrangements have been made everywhere in view of Narendra Modi's visit to Patna again.
The police carried out a thorough check on the route of Modi's visit and the meeting place.
Police will keep an eye on people coming to the meetings.
Gujarat police force, NSGIB and state police will keep an eye on security.
Modi's security cover will be further tightened.
Meanwhile, questions have also been raised on the BJP's Asthi Kalash Yatra taken out with the people killed in the Patna blast.
Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has alleged that the BJP is trying to vitiate the atmosphere.
The Congress has given tickets to all the old MLAs again.
The list includes 6 old and 2 new faces.
Among the new faces, Nirmala Sapre from Bina assembly constituency in Sagar district and Pratap Singh Lodhi from Jabera assembly constituency in Damoh district have been given a chance.
Three MLAs from Sagar, two from Tikamgarh and one from Chhatarpur have been given re-tickets.
As expected, Govind Singh Rajput from Surkhi in Sagar, Arunoday Choubey from Khurai and Narayan Prajapati from Banda have been re-nominated.
Yadavendra-Singh from Tikamgarh, Brijendra Singh Rathore from Prithvipur and Vikram Singh Nati Raja from Rajnagar in Chhatarpur have been given tickets.
All of them are sitting MLAs from these areas.
After the first list of BJP and Congress, there will be a fight between new faces from both parties in Bina.
In Bina, BJP's Mahesh Rai and Congress' Nirmala Sapre are pitted against each other.
In Tikamgarh's Prithvipur, sitting Congress MLA Brijendra-Singh Rathore is pitted against former minister Late Bjp. Sunil will be from Nayak's wife Anita Nayak.
Bjp's Ramakrishna Kusmaria will be contesting against sitting MLA Vikramsingh Nati Raja from Rajnagar.
Bjp MP Bhupender Singh and BJP MLA Arunoday Choubey are pitted against each other in Khurai.
Bjp's Parul Sahu is contesting against Govind Rajput, the MLA from Surkhi.
Guillaume Nicklauks's adaptation of Dennis Diderot's novel details the finest production design and time span, but it has gone beyond what it should have been.
The novel, dating back to the French era of the 1760s, tells the tragic story of a young nobleman named Suzanne, who is sent to the convent by his family members.
When she rebels, she faces extreme cruelty at the hands of the willingly oppressor, Mother Superior, and becomes an object of sensual attraction to another.
This film never goes into sexuality or sensationalism — and that's the problem.
Due to the strong seriousness of the storytelling, there is also a risk of it becoming a boring film for the audience.
Own railway found in U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel
One of the most complex drug trafficking tunnels has been found between the U.S.A. and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. officials have described the four-foot by three-foot tunnel as one of the most complex secret passages ever discovered.
The tunnel is roughly the length of six football pitches, which is located in the warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A. It connects to.
The area is filled with warehouses alike, which makes it easy to hide a truck being loaded with drugs.
Officials said the tunnel was closed before any drugs could pass through it.
According to court records, authorities have seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel search.
Three men, who authorities said were acting as drivers, were charged with possessing marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distribution.
If convicted, they could face jail terms ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
Smugglers in Nogales, Arizona, take advantage of vast underground drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth major thoroughfare discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels have been discovered since central Mexico's marijuana harvest in October, enabling drug mafia groups to quickly deliver the product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 700-yard route equipped with rail tracks that stretched from a home kitchen in Tijuana to San Diego warehouses.
There was an exchange of greetings between the two in the cabinet meeting.
At the end of the meeting, Singh praised the chief minister's speech at the chintan shivir for his counter-attack on Narendra Modi.
Regarding his speech, he also said that there is no other emotion in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges should be met firmly.
The chief minister also had the same expression on his face that he took Singh's speech positively.
It is known that Singh had urged the Chief Minister to give respect to the workers in the Chintan Shivir and save them from the alleged harassment of officers.
However, he also said that he was ready to be sacked from the Cabinet for making his point.
However, after the opinion that emerged in the meditation camp, there is a possibility of a fresh thought in the matter of appointing workers to government posts.
At the camp, state JD(U) president Vashishtha Narayan Singh had said that the nomination of workers to the 20-point committees will be announced soon.
His indication was that the list was almost ready.
It is being reported that now Chief Minister Nitish Kumar himself will inspect the list from his own level.
They will also examine whether the opinion of MLAs and MPs has been taken in making the list.
If needed, the list will be overhauled extensively to accommodate old and committed workers.
The general allegation of MLAs and MPs is that their opinion was not taken in making the list of nominations.
The names of those who came much later from other parties have been included in the list, while many important workers active since the days of Samata Party have been neglected.
Halloween 2013: by numbers
When I was younger, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay quiet late and play dress up for the neighborhood.
Nowadays, I have become more than a greedy person.
I didn't even sign in to give candy out of my apartment for the past two years and probably won't this year.
But statistics show that I am a black sheep when Halloween arrives.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans are actually celebrating Halloween this time for $158 million. It will spend $6.9 billion on candies and costumes and decorations.
The one thing I've always seen is everything. Halloween trends.
According to NRF, out of the total expenditure of $6.9 billion, the cost of the dress is estimated at $1.2 billion
This year everyone is angry with sexy inanimate objects.
Women do not have to do prostitution; Because they are also sexy foods such as pizza, hamburgers and carrots.
For men I hope there are lots of zombies, and thanks to the dead space will create our Instagram feeds for men this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes will be zombies, batmans, robbers and witches.
My guess is that there's nothing wrong with being traditional.
Last year we dressed up the dogs and to our surprise we weren't alone.
According to the NRF, Americans will literally spend $330 million on pet clothing.
This is the irony that a lot of hotdogs are with dogs.
We don't look around when it comes to candy.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to Nielsen Company.
Hairy bars, lollipops, milk dudes, twizels and clark bars are worth around 600 million pounds.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, it's good news that 41 million tricks and tricks are going to participate in our neighborhood.
But in reality, we, and those who are joking, will buy 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
According to the Confectioners Association, one thing we will not use during Halloween is candycorn, but it will also sell for about 35 million pounds.
That's about 9 billion individual kernels of corn.
It's a secret. To solve it yet
There's nothing more elemental than Halloween ghost houses.
They were best named, like "Terror behind the Wall (which is actually a prison), "Scream-O-Scream" and "House of Shock."
According to American power, there are actually 1,200 officially sanctioned haunted houses in the United States that generate 500 million revenues. And those awesome good pictures that your friend puts on Facebook and the man who likes and comments on you nice face.
Finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced the great pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a jack-o-lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree — it's something we've done since we were little.
Luckily for us, the "Baby in a Pumpkin Trend" started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these guards and not hanging out with them.
This year, Americans will spend around $106 million on pumpkin, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Jack-O-slowly wilted lantern on its front porch probably from Illinois, which grew by 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you're looking for additional loans, call Tim and Susan Matisdon in Napa, Calif., and try to engrave their 2,032-pound pumpkin above.
Some people are born with silver spoons, some make life ideal with their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
One such person is a name. Dhirubhai Ambani's also comes.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani, was born on December 28, 1932, in a school in Chorwad, a small village in Gujarat.
Dhirubhai was the third among five siblings.
The family has five children Ramniklal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumati.
Due to financial constraints, Dhirubhai had to drop out of school only after high school.
Dhirubhai started helping the family financially in childhood.
At this time he used to set up a bhajiya shop near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited on the number of tourists coming here.
Talking about Dhirubhai's first job, in 1949, at the age of 17, he reached the city of Aden in Yemen by a ship called Kabota.
Here his elder brother Ramniklal had made all the arrangements for him, so he did not have any problem in getting a job abroad.
But there was something else going on in Dhirubhai's mind.
So in 1954 he returned home.
In 1955, he reached Mumbai to try his luck with 500 rupees in his pocket.
And that's where his business journey began.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani took such steps that he never looked back.
His name became famous not only in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani passed away on July 6, 2002.
At this time they were the owners of 62000 crores.
At present, his sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are handling his sultanate.
Like the father, today the name of these two brothers is also among the businessmen of international level.
Who doesn't know the Ambani family today?
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and his wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.
Is Europe's upper class ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April and pledged to bring business together and determine if the U.K. The employment and prosperity creator of the EU. What changes do we want to see in our relationship?
For that, we conducted the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders, asking them what the EU is capable of. What are their thoughts on uk business?
YouGov interviewed 1,000 business leaders representing the UK's business sizes, regions and locations.
The findings of this survey may come as a surprise to many people.
We found that a large proportion of businesses now want to export out of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing, while the EU is growing. Member countries are becoming stagnant.
They want the government to prioritise new trade relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, not the EU. They were engaged in a long-term and arduous process of reforming mysterious institutions.
When asked their views on specific policy areas ranging from monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that control of these decisive qualifications should come back to Westminster.
The general dissatisfaction with the single market was easily visible, with businessmen saying the price of Brussels' regulation far outweighed the benefits of being part of Europe's trading sector – even as 40 percent of the big businessmen who traditionally favored European companies agreed.
Finally and most obviously, our survey of business leaders found that, a large proportion clearly want the UK, the EU to be the worst. Instead of politics, trade-based relations and treaties moved forward on the path of change.
This finding, which was seen across levels across major business groups, demonstrated that businessmen are driving towards a "meaningful change" that is similar to that of the U.K. Give back its lost power.
It has a very high price – for Britain, the issue of treaty change and getting a better deal has led to the eu losing the vote in the vote. He changed 16 percent of the vote in favor of staying in the U.S.
The Prime Minister should not be in any doubt: this survey shows that Uk businessmen are not in the EU. We support his plan to negotiate the terms of the UK's membership.
It also showed that businessmen, the current balance of power in the U.K. Let's look forward to making a meaningful change in favor of renegotiating ourselves.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and is increasingly becoming imperative as the eurozone moves towards a finite economy and a fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as our survey findings show that for businesses this means a new focused focus on business and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory practices.

Kenyan press outraged over controversial media law
The newspaper challenged the bill as unconstitutional, saying that "it is a horrible place, and it is legitimate to ask: What is there to prevent parliament from taking away the independence of the judiciary in the coming days?"
Capital Group – which is Kenya's most prestigious independent radio station and news website CapitalFM. "This law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of The Indian Express. "
He said the new media tribunal would "always be biased, because it is part of the government" and said banning content and advertising would harm Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it to M.P. Singh," he said. Send people back. "
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill would give the government "strict control over the media", while The Standard said democracy and free speech in Kenya had suffered a "severe setback" and called the bill cruel.
The bill is being passed as one of the measures to strengthen national security after an Islamist gunman attacked a Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenyan media had broadcast security camera footage of the squads sent to the site of the attack, showing them purposefully looting the mall, which angered the authorities in Kenya.
Police Chief David Kimayo had summoned two journalists and a media person for questioning, although the summons were withdrawn after the media created a ruckus.
Under the new bill, media companies could be fined 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists could face a fine of one million Kenyan shillings, and there would be an additional risk of being "deleted" or denied official press recognition.
The tribunal also has the power to confiscate the property of the violator in case of non-payment of penalty.
According to the Daily Nation, "Most FM f.m. One penalty is enough to shake the foundations of the stations. "
It also said these measures could have devastating effects on what Kenya describes as a "vibrant blogosphere".
By closing the mouth of the media, politicians know that they can do what they want.

Obama's healthcare proposal withdrawn
Amid a barrage of criticism, President Obama yesterday retracted his often-repeated misleading promise that "you can continue with your health plan if you like it." "
With millions of people receiving revocation notices from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days for misleading U.S. citizens.
Yesterday, Obama changed his real message.
He said in a speech in Boston that "a lot of people who have health insurance, and it's useful, can continue." "
Addressing what he calls a "news shock" about the repeal, Obama urged Americans who received the information to buy new coverage in the market.
Most people will be able to get a better deal, with as much money or a comprehensive healthcare plan as much cheaper than proposed.
He said, "You'll get a better deal. "
The administration has said that it should come as no surprise that 5 per cent of the population who buy insurance with their own money may be forced to change their plans as their coverage does not conform to the standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
In a statement before the Committee on Homeland Energy and Commerce in Washington, Sebelius said: "I tell these Americans directly, 'You deserve better than this.' "
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace since October has been "unfortunate".
"I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else," he said.
I want to regain your trust.
After a heated exchange with Republicans, Cebelius angrily said this sentence to a colleague sitting behind him at a House hearing yesterday, which was caught by a mike. Billy Long, R-Mo. about whether he would need to be enrolled in Obamacare.
In the hearing that lasted more than three hours, Long repeatedly asked Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan through Healthcare.gov, which she is now selling to millions of Americans.

Parents of Georgia teen killed in 'unique accident' believe their son was murdered
A Georgia teenager whose dead body was found wrapped in a wrestling mat at his high school gym believes his son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Valdosta, G.A. Kendrick Johnson was found trapped in a mat standing directly behind bleachers inside his high school gym on January 11.
Londes County Sheriff's investigators concluded Johnson died in a "unique accident" but the 17-year-old's family denied it.
Advocate Benjamin Crump, who represented Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News.com that "they fully believe their son was murdered".
They don't trust death in the way the sheriff told them.
"I think this goes beyond the logic of physical laws and common sense," Crump said. "
The findings, he feels, are an excuse to protect the person or people responsible for his son's death.
He said that "he had sent his son to school with a book-back, and he returned in a body bag"
U.S. Attorney General Michael Mueller said Thursday he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that too many important questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was he murdered because of a crime?
Murray said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will abide by the facts, wherever they take us.
My aim is to bring out the truth.
"My view is that environmental reasons exist for a formal investigation. "
Moore told the reporter that initial autopsy indicated Johnson's death was a result of "positional asphyxiation."
According to Moore, a second autopsy revealed a different cause of death. "
"There are a lot of questions that need to be answered or confirmed. "
Moore also said that if he found enough evidence to summon a criminal or investigate civil rights in connection with Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to do so. I will say.
A representative from the Laundage County Sheriff's Office was not immediately available for comment when contacted on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a southern Georgia judge ordered authorities to release all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope the video footage will provide some clues as to how he died.
Addressing a rally, Modi said, "If you look at the speeches of Congress or UPA leaders in the last two months, you will find that they do not talk about what they have done. "

Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and his government is there, yet he needs an answer from Modi.
It is your duty to answer to the people.
Modi was apparently responding to Sibal, who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wants an environment under his control where he delivers his speeches and does not talk to journalists to evade questions.
Sibal also challenged Modi to have a face-to-face debate.

Blair says he wants to return to Britain
Tony Blair said he would like a chance to become Britain's prime minister again – but he believes a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview taken at night to mark the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's Office, Blair, 59, expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After stepping down in June 2007 after a decade as leader, limiting most of his comments to his role of representative of foreign affairs and Middle East group peacekeepers, Mr Blair largely avoided discussing British politics.
Asked if he would like to return to the prime ministership, Blair was quoted by London's Evening Standard newspaper as saying: "Yes, sure, but that is unlikely to happen, so..."
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.

Do you like glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken full advantage of the sea animal to develop the best breakfast.
He got the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China used chemical glitter to re-polish the protein.
Ice cream will react with the tongue of the eater and increase the pH level of the protein and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says that ice cream ignites with the reaction of the heat of the mouth, that is, the more you win, the more it will ignite.
Charlie, founder of The Lic Me I'm Delicious Ice Cream Company, said: "It's an incredible thing, but in the early days of production, you'll get about £200 to about 2 grams of stuff".
The protein we are using in ice cream will react with a neutral pH in the tongue.
As the mouth heats up, the proteins will raise the pH level and the ice cream will shine.
We've been doing the test for the past few months and it looks perfect to share on Halloween because it delivers amazing glow effects.
This will probably be the most expensive ice cream I've ever made because the shine of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So each scoop costs me around 140 pounds.
It tastes great though.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavor, including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaf.
But his next work is going to prove to be even more ambitious.
He said: "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream."
It's inherently impossible because of the ice crystals that create refraction on top of ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream is the utility of the fluorescent property of a jellyfish, which has been synthesized by Chinese scientists

Normal life was also affected by the cold.
People stayed indoors to avoid the cold wave.
Meanwhile, power supply was also disrupted in many areas.

The court blocked the New York Police Department's action on pause and sports policy.
On Thursday, a federal appeals court blocked changes requiring a judge's order for the New York Police Department's break and sports program and removed the judge from the case.
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 2 and Judge Shira Shindelor has said that the judge's decision will be pending the outcome of an appeal by the city.
The judge ruled in August that it violated the Constitution by excluding people from its program of stopping and interrogating people.
The city's police department has decided to allocate a monitor to help change its policy and the training program associated with it, appealing its findings and its remedial order.
The appeals court heard arguments on the request on migration on Tuesday.
The appeals court has said that because he compromised the requirement for a judge to avoid the appearance of bias in a series of media interviews and should be removed from the judge's case because he committed wrongs contrary to the U.S. Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges by the public, the statements should be publicly responded to criticizing the court.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of thousands of people by unfairly targeting black and Hispanic men with its breaks and sports program.
She has appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including economic reforms in policies, training and supervision, and has ordered a pilot program to test some of the body-worn cameras on campus where most stops occur.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were dismissed after a police moratorium.
An oral argument on the city's appeal is scheduled for some time after 14 March 2014.
The pause and play tactic has been criticized with civil rights advocates.
The pause and sports policy has been around for decades in some form, but has mostly stopped increasing dramatically from black and Hispanic men, from 684,330 in 2011 to an all-time high under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg.
A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all minorities, and became a class action case.
Proponents of the NYPD's pause and sports program changes have stated that unfair treatment will put an end to a more reliable and effective police force and may affect other police department policy use.
Opponents say the changes will lower police morale, but will solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after crime, wasting money and not shrinking by thousands of officers during the past decade.
The judge noted that the pause and play did not keep an end, which is constitutional, but had improved the implementation of the NYPD's stop.
Kerosene will not be available at these shops in half a dozen states if the new government continues the policy of stopping the sale of kerosene through ration after the general elections.
The states where the sale of kerosene is to be stopped include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand.
Apart from these, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and some northeastern states are also preparing to stop the sale of kerosene.
According to oil ministry sources, a decision will be taken to stop the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states on two grounds.
First, electricity connections are being made rapidly in rural areas.
The second base is the LPG connection.
That is, in states where most of the rural households have been given LPG connections, the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped.
The Petroleum Ministry has made strong preparations in this regard.
The sale of PDS kerosene has already stopped in Delhi since October 2013.
According to sources, under this policy, kerosene quota has been significantly reduced in Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand.
Punjab's quota was reduced from 2.72 lakh kilo litres to one lakh kilo litres.
Uttarakhand's allocation was reduced by 70 per cent and Haryana's kerosene quota by about 40 per cent.
Despite this cut, there has been no report of shortage of kerosene from these states.
The ministry believes that it is clear that kerosene has been used for adulteration.
There is a difference of Rs 37 in the price of PDS kerosene and diesel at present.
This promotes adulteration.
In states where the sale through PDS will be stopped, oil companies will sell kerosene at full price in the open market.
At present, oil companies are losing more than Rs 39 per liter on kerosene.
The kerosene subsidy burden in 2013-14 is estimated to be around Rs 31,000 crore.

Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
People might argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: About a hundred years ago the comic playwright Frank Fey, who served as the master of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the people sitting in the crowd in a way of conversation.
Fay's quest has expanded over the years, most recently, at the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and run by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Standup Institute called The Carolinas, the festival celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, featuring more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these headliners appeared in the Carolinas, and became huge successes, to a level where they became too big to be played at the club," says Hirsch. "
We created this celebration as a way to continue working with them.
This year's program includes the presence of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as annual musical and comedy benefits for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, "Stand Up for Heroes" which featured Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby, among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Many of the comedians participating in this year's festival have come from non-traditional mediums, such as Comedy Center, F.X. and shows coming on smaller networks like Spike.
Nick Kroll rose to the lead position with the deep-cable sitcom (FXX's gleefully Ronchi fantasy-football themed "The League"), and now has his own comedy central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member of "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marsell the Shell with Shoes On". "
Other young comedians with different voices, including Kroll and Slate, (Anthony Jeselnick with a completely different depressing voice, satirical, ethnocentric W. Kamau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
Among the highlights of the celebration will be, an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David:
Steinberg began working as a standup comedian, but has become a well-known television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he worked on TV. He hosted a show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on London.
The meeting will take place at a town hall in the heart of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely a fan of the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work," Steinberg said. It is in. "
He was telling me that, when he was here, sometimes he would go down the street between two buildings and think to himself that if I ever lost all my money, I would stay here.
Moving through soil, rivers and forest to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Weil is delivering free healthcare to rural areas of Cameroon
Vail and his team see hundreds of patients almost each weekend.
West African countries don't have a lot of therapists; There is only one doctor for 5,000 people.
Give your vote here or through mobile
Dr. Georges Vail was awarded the CNN Prize in 2013. He is one of the top 10 heroes.
You can choose CNN for them or anyone in the other top 10. You can vote to be the hero of the year.
The winning person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Vail had seen his ailing father regain consciousness and faint, going to the hospital, who was not properly equipped to assist him.
Jamel Weil was injured in a car crash near Cameroon's capital Yonde in 1981.
Initially, only his arm was broken, but an infection grew that spread to his brain, and he created a hemorrhoid, which affected the rest of his life.
"There was no neurosurgeon in Cameroon," says Georges Vail. "
If we had the money, we would have taken our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Vale continued to take his father to the overcrowded clinics and hospitals and receive whatever treatment he could.
"It's not easy," Vail said. "
You leave home at 5 am hoping that you will be the first person to reach the hospital, but that doesn't happen.
There are a lot of patients there.
Some people may die while waiting.
The situation hasn't changed much since the death of Vail's father in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one doctor for every 5000 people.
By comparison, there is one physician for every 413 persons in the United States.
And even if there are doctors, many Cameroonian residents can't afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and the private sector accounts for nearly two-thirds of the country's healthcare expenditure.
"Their only problem is poverty," says Vail. "
And being poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his father and his countrymen, Vale was determined to find some solution to it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries over the past year.
He also became a physician himself, and started working as a vascular surgeon at the Centre Hospital in Yonde.
And he started the non-profit organization Eskovime, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and about 30 people sit in vans, tie medical supplies to the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical attention.
Sometimes luck is not with them.
They have to push the vehicle through rivers and soil more than once.
But when they arrive, they get the honor of truly heroes: feasts, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation that the community can offer.
The free medical care in these villages is indeed a cause for celebration, and Vel – with his big smile and endless energy – happily joins in.
The next morning his team begins to meet hundreds of patients.
"We are meeting 500 people on each trip. "
They come from around 60 kilometres from the village, and come on foot.
All these weekend clinics offer a variety of medical service.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get crutches, donated glasses or a free birth certificate – a document that is required in school, but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery with spatial anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school building, town hall, or at home; After the procedure, the patient walks to the recovery site, making room for the next person.
The group's generator illuminates the operation room and sanitizing equipment, and Vale and his volunteers get up early in the morning on Sundays to work.
It's waist-breaking pace, but village musicians generally help keep the troupe motivated.
"They play drums all night to keep us awake and continue their work," Vail said. "
On Sundays, their crew returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
The group – which includes Cameroonian physicians and foreign medical students – has performed 700 free surgeries in the past year, and they know that their help can change the world of the people they help.
One person said that due to the free hernia surgery, he would be able to go back to work.
"It will change the future of me and my family. "
Apart from running weekend clinics and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Vel also works at a private medical clinic around Yonde at night.
He reported that this is his second job that finances 60% of his non-profit work; The rest is met by private donations.
"I don't know when they fall asleep," said Katy O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Well's group. "
They are always either in the hospital, or trying to make money for their organization, so that they keep running these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe to join Weil's campaign, this is an experimental opportunity they can never get in their own country.
"We have been able to gain practical experience in the surgeries we use to help Dr. Vail grab tools or clear blood stains," O'Malley said. "
As a second-year medical student in the U.S., you'll never have the opportunity to do that.
Volunteer students usually pay for their own to reach Cameroon, and they often come with donated medical supplies.
But after reaching Yonde, they bear the cost of their stay, travel and instructions.
"There's no doubt they're heroes," says O'Malley. "
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon is never going to end.
For Vail, the workload, almost the same, is not difficulty.
Helping other people live happy lives, fulfilling the promise they made to their father, these are the things that bring them great joy.
"I'm very happy when I do this job," says Vail. "
And I think about my father.
I hope they see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, to ease their pain.

In this regard, a proposal has been sent to the government on behalf of the ADA, which is going to be approved soon.
Surrounded by the Ganga-Yamuna on three sides, this historic city is no longer left with a plot on which the ADA can make a big residential plan.
In such a situation, he has now planned to make a residential plan ahead of Jhunsi in the east, Phaphamau in the north direction and Naini in the south direction.
A meeting was held under the chairmanship of District Magistrate Rajashekhar to give a comprehensive shape to this plan.
The ADA has mooted the idea of covering 200 revenue villages of Phulpur, Soraon and Karchana.
Chaka and Bahadur blocks will come to an end once they come under the jurisdiction of ADA.

Mozambique's security concerns grow as powerful personalities clash
With a statue of Mozambique's founding president Samora staring down at him, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo for the peace slogan in a rare public display.
"We want peace back, we want stability," said Vanessa De Sousa, chief executive officer of an investment company.

Clashes between government forces and Ray Namo have been reported almost daily for two weeks, since more than 20 years ago of a peace agreement.
Ray Namo was once a notorious rebel of a movement initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and South Africa's apartheid government, as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace accord, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to return to full-blown conflict, but recent events have emboldened foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy that the discovery of the northwest's vast offshore gas reserves and coal reserves could bring in some of the companies including Rio Tinto, Brazil's Vale, Eni, from more than $50bn in investment next year.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Ray Namo blame each other for the tensions.
Ray Namo says the government launched the latest conflict on October 17 by launching attacks on its members in Sofa La province, a traditional Re Namo stronghold.
As the attacks on former rebels and then escalated, government forces attacked Renmo positions and tried to kill Afonso Dhaka Ma, the group's leader, Fernando Mazhang, Ray Namo's spokesman, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Ray Namo for triggering the confrontation, accusing the soldiers of attacking him.
President Armando Jibuzan has called for concerns about instability to be addressed.
Mr Jibuchan told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Dhakama saw himself as a "loser" "whatever it is, his forces continue to try to prove that he can impose his own decision on the government."
Both Free Limo and Ray Namo insist that they want to avoid war .
Mr . Mazhang was quoted as saying that Ray Namo had cancelled the 1992 peace agreement but has since become a matter of concern again.
He told the FT that means he is not being awarded by the Free Limo
Our vision is to come back to compromise negotiations, but seriously," Mr. Mazhang said.
Previous talks between the two sides did little to ease tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
"It's about two big men (Jibuzan and Dhakama) fighting together," said Youssef Hahn, a lecturer at London Open University and a Mozambican expert.
Neither of them are good negotiators nor are they necessarily willing to make the kinds of concessions.
Ray Namo, who has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already spoken about boycotting the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to win concessions and economic plunder from the government.
Ray Namo's share in voting has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) in which it was formed by a former Ray Namo member, is expected to improve its performance in the elections.
Mr. Mazhang says Mr. Jibuchanko - who is stepping down at the end of his second term next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want to give up presidency because he doesn't want peace, doesn't want transparent elections," Mr. Mazhang said.
What kind of capability Ray Namo has is not clear, but it is a major North South highway he has made disruptive hit-and-run visits to police stations and vehicles..
Most of the clashes are in Sofa La province, several hundred kilometers north of Jomaputo, which hosts Beira Port which miners, including Rio Tinto and the valley, rely on exporting coal.
In June, the Railways suspended its experiment for nearly a week in Rio after threatening to attack the Ray Namo line.
Asked if Ray Namo would be able to replicate this threat, Mr. Mazhangvineet was almost asked.
"Things were not going well in Mozambique who wanted to warn the international community," Ray Namo said.
The government of instability added to the frustrations, says Fernando Lima, media cop, who heads an independent media company, many are also concerned about corruption, slow growth and a recent spate of kidnappings.
"The people responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and think he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.
The Omar Sultanate, a demonstrator, people still need stability.
"Nobody cares about Ray Namo and Free Limo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he said.

Pope Francis to announce the name of First Cardinal in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will appoint a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term on February 22.
Cardinals are the highest-class priests in the Catholic Church, with only the pope at their rank, and they choose the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of individuals, who will ultimately assist in choosing his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals there.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, cardinals are not allowed to participate in the election of the pope - they come in the group of 120 "cardinal electors".
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the ceremony of the promotion of the new cardinals, a meeting of all existing cardinals will be held, which is called the Pope's House.
"Pope Francis has decided to advance his decision to hold the February Council of Popes, so that it becomes easier to plan other meetings involving cardinals from different countries of the world," Lombardi said. "
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors was likely to decrease by February.
He said that the Pope, in general, announces the names of cardinals who are over the age of 80, as many cardinals as they wish, as the number of cardinals is less than 120.
"Next year's Pope Assembly will be important because it will be the first papal since Francis was elected in March this year," Valero said.
At present, there is a kind of prejudice towards Europe, and especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of South Americans are Roman Catholics, but their number is much lower in cardinals.
They will also be the first cardinals to be elected after Francis created the Council of Cardinals – a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with finding ways to reform the Church.
Before that, the Pope used to decide everything on his own.
"Right now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to assist him," Valero said. "
He said it was "possible" that Francis would seek advice from the Cardinals.
But we haven't been in this situation before – it's brand new.
Valero said normally popes give the rank of cardinal to bishops of large places, but Francis was "a complete surprise – so we don't know whose name he will declare." "
Foreign workers on a 457 visa can undergo an "authenticity" test
A "authenticity" test for foreign workers on 457 visas is being considered by the government, as it aims to extend a drastic action.
If adopted, the test will be implemented through a criterion designed to prevent 457 being used in Australia to fill unskilled positions or to be disguised to family and friends.
Today, a government discussion paper was released, condemning the government's rhetoric about foreign workers. Maxine McCue said today that it could anger Australia's neighboring countries.
He told the American India Institute today that the loud rhetoric about "foreigners are reaching the end of the queue" and "Australians job first" is a very unpleasant repetition at a time when unions are demanding a safe labour market. "
Historically, this meant that white workers should have been protected – and I wouldn't be surprised if some people in the area saw the echo of that historical evidence.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met with officials about trafficked, has implemented five of the recommended changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the "authenticity" criterion is adopted, the visa applicant can be examined about "whether the nomination is true in circumstances in which the nominee is a relative or personal partner of the owner or relevant person of the person sponsoring the visa".
Businessmen may need to keep a count of the number of 457 visa holders, as the first businessmen who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees hired hundreds of people.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving in a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man's distraught nine-year-old son had accompanied him on a trip to Australia, and after his father's death on Wednesday, one of his adult cousins, who was on the same vessel, has been arrested.
Australian authorities transported the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
