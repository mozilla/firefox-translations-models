RhiBS suspended two forex traders.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, two people who are experts in the matter have received this information, another sign that the global investigation by regulators into suspicious currency market manipulation is progressing rapidly.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in their investigation into the world's largest financial market, which has a daily trading volume of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS employees to be suspended as the investigation of the case, which appears to be a repeat of the Libor Interbank Loan Manipulation scandal, proceeds.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received a request for information from regulators this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank said, "Our investigation into this matter is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators".
Last month, experts in the case said that RBS had sent the records of emails and instant messages received from the former trader and sent them to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010, and it is believed that it has been relieved of its current position as European Head of Forex Spot Trading at JP Morgan.
The head of European spot trading in City, Rohani Ramchandani, took a leave of absence last week, while the former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Experts in the case reported that Mr. Usher's instant messaging group included Barclays and Citigroup bankers.
UBS said that after being informed by Swiss regulator FINMA that it was investigating suspicious manipulation of the foreign exchange market in many Swiss banks, it has taken action against some of its employees this week.
At least six authorities globally - the European Commission, Finland, the Competition Authority of Switzerland, VCO, FCA, the Department of Justice in the US, and the Monetary Authority of Hong Kong - are investigating allegations of defrauding bankers to cause favorable fluctuations in the currency market.
According to people familiar with the case, HSBC, CityGroup, JP Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted internal investigations, or received requests for information from regulators.
Banks are closely investigating the use of instant messaging and emails for years in search of clues to wrongdoing.
News of the investigation has stirred up turmoil among traders in the sector, who have been among the top earners in the investment bank trading unit for the past several years, but are facing a challenge this year, as low volatility in currencies has reduced opportunities for bookmakers.
Some bankers tried to suppress the case by saying that it was impossible to manipulate the very large and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say that this is not necessarily true.
The senior trader said that despite the enormous volume of foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of their own platforms by banks means that "you can start to influence the market at a slightly lower ticket price".
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that the trader would be discharged this week from its Exchange-Traded Funds desk in London, which had lost about $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
Credit Suisse said: "We believe that the trader acted alone, and that he has been controlled".
A new policy of board changes has begun in the municipalities.
Recently, the Congress-led board of councillors in the Sanithiya Municipality of Veerbhum district was transformed into the board of Trinamool due to a change of party.
This change was made as most Congressmen, including the chairman of the Municipal Council of Trimmel, joined the party.
Not only the Congress but also some MPs from the Makpa, Bhakpa and Forward Bloc have also stopped the repression of Trinamool here.
Mukul Rai, the general secretary of the Trinamool Congress, considers this a good sign for the party.
He says that ten parishes of Congress, including the chairman of the Sanithiya Municipality, Virendra Parich and Congress leader, Viplav Dutta, joined the Trinamool.
Some leftist councillors, including the Makpa, have also seized the banner of Trinamool.
All of them have written to the district magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act stating that they have become part of Trinamool and that the Sanithiya Municipal Board has also come under the control of Trinamool, according to the number force.
Shri Rai also claims that all agree with the outline of the development of Bengal under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties including Congress, Makpa, Bhakpa, and Forward Block are moving forward to join the Trinamool Congress.
Qualified leaders of any party are welcome in Trinamool.
The takeover of Trinamool on the municipal board is being considered a milestone in political circles due to the shift of Congress councillors in the Sanithiya municipality ahead of the November 22 five municipal elections.
Also in the former left-wing-ruled Haldia and Nadiya, Congress-ruled municipal boards are examples of Trinamool's occupation of the area.
In municipal boards in the districts of Tangi, when the party is occupied by Trinamool due to a change of party, those who join the party are greeted with a grand welcome at the Trinamool building in Kolkata.
Mukul Rai, the Secretary General of the Trinamool Congress, is excited to break away from other parties and join the Trinamool of leaders.
He says that anyone who breaks away from any party is welcome in Trinamool.
He claims that under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, the people's trust is growing which has resulted in people wanting to join Trinamool.
However, the main opposition party, the Makhpa, says that lower-level leaders of other parties are being intimidated.
People are joining the Trinamool Congress in fear of terror.
The change in the board of elected local bodies is seen by the Makpa as a shock to democracy.
Any party has the right to democratically expand its mandate, but the justification for changing the voting system in power must be questioned.
The bike was parked in a lavary condition near the forest of Pipcho.
This bike has been seized by the police.
This bike was owned by the postman of Jharpo, Shotti Mehta.
He has been placed on the electoral planning and reception committees in the assembly elections, from the provincial level to the election commission.
The incumbent, Satchidananda उपासने, who is running for the Rajpur North seat as the state's vice president, has been appointed as the election director of the Rajpur Rural seat.
The worshippers have been asked to take over the provincial office and visit anywhere in the province if necessary.
The election of several officials, including Ramsevek Pakra, the state president of the region, and Shri Shivaratan Sharma, the chief minister of the organization, has left the organization's chief minister Ram Pratap alone.
This is why worship has been given a vital responsibility.
RDA President Sunil Soni, who was a contender from the northern seat, has been given the task of running the election for the Raipur South seat.
Another applicant, Sanjay Sravasthwa, the chairman of the municipal corporation, has been appointed to the provincial welcome committee.
Star propagandists of the Wayhi Party will help to welcome, move and host national leaders.
The committee also includes a few other ticket holders, including Sony.
Shyam Basarang seat and Leilaram Bhojwaani will conduct the elections for Rajnanandhigaon seat.
Speaking of Bishnoi, the MP said that one day in a special community home, printing photos of people eating a meal without a meal does not make anyone a benefactor of the poor.
They visit different homes three times a day and eat the chourma, but never preach it.
Speaking at a meeting of Congressmen from Maham Halke on Friday, MP Deependra Hooda from Rohtak said that the rally in Ghouna on November 10 is of great importance to you and us.
The Jan Salab rally will make the opposition feel the strength of the current government.
Prof. Virendra and MLA Anand Singh Dangi also addressed the meeting.
He also forwarded a list of about ten thousand activists who had arrived at the rally from various villages.
Prior to the meeting, the MP inaugurated and laid the foundation stone of the construction of four-lane road in the city, including the Covard Shade of Grain Mandi, the Second Waterhouse Mahmoud, the State Multi-Tech Institute Building, the widening of the Gohan-Lakhmanajra-Mahmoud-Bivani road.
During the event, the Congress's rural district chairman Jaideep Dhankhar, Jagat Kala, Dharmabir Lawyer, Balram Dangi, Vikas Caesar, Shamsher Kharak, Anil Sharma, Dr. Sunil Rangi, Deepak Gupta, Dharma Raj Sarpanch, Sadhū Baba and Nirmala Rathi were present.
Asaram, who is in prison for sexual assault, was again disappointed by the Supreme Court on Friday.
In the media coverage claimed by Ashiaram, he is being portrayed as a blood-drinking child drakula, but the court rejected his demand to ban media coverage.
Chief Justice P. Satshivam's bench refused to order the media to stop spreading news about Asaram, saying that he had seen every word reported in the media and saw no reason to interfere.
How can we stop them when the police and others are getting such information from them?
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer accused the media of exaggerating news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
Against whom they file a case, but the bench was not affected by these arguments and refused to intervene in the case, saying they had other options.
Earlier, the court had rejected Asaram's demand to ban media coverage.
The British government has announced a study to increase Scotland's benefits from the HS2 railway project.
The actions by HShi2 indicate high-speed services in Scotland and the north of England, which will soon be launched with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "unite Britain".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said they were "very excited" to be working with the UK government on this project.
The first phase will include a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When the second stage is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the cost of building a high-speed link between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which was negotiating with Scotland Transport, directed HS2 Ltd. to consider the possibility of further improving rail capacity and travel time for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing the travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London by three hours or less.
According to Baroness Kramer: "Our goal for HS2 is a real national network, bringing the UK and its cities closer together".
We are moving forward with HShi2, as its benefits will be enormous.
Without it, we would face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about connectivity of 18 cities across the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be better connected due to HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland".
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr Carmichael for Scotland's "clear" return to the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "High-speed rail is likely to be a major economic benefit to Scotland, but it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in terms of high-speed rail across the UK.
We are therefore excited to work with the British Government to explore options to bring high-speed rail to Scotland, create benefits for all, and complete the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report with British government ministers next year and to making joint decisions on further action.
The lecture of Shri Hanuman Chalisa, to be held on November 23 at Dana Mandi near Jalandhar Bypass by the Sri Hindu Justice Bench, will be delivered by the National Anti-Terrorist Front President Maninderjit Singh Bitta along with 10,000 children.
This information was given to the crowd by Bitta after he was invited to read the text of Hanuman Chalisa by the chief spokesman of the Shri Hindu Justice Bench, Praveen Dung and Ashwani Katyal, Bhupinder Benga, Surjit Jain, Bunty Bajaj, Raman Khosla, Bantu and Anil Sharma.
He praised the efforts of the Shri Hindu Justice Bench to connect children with the Sananat culture.
He said that for the unity and integrity of the country, it is also necessary to provide religious education to children, including secular education.
The Supreme Court refused to stop media reporting.
The Supreme Court said it could not tell the media not to report information from the police or any other source.
Ashiaram's lawyer said that Ashiaram is being called Dracula in this case.
There are guidelines for reporting in this case but they are not being followed.
On this, the Supreme Court said that you have many other treatments that you can use in such a situation.
Ashiaram's lawyer said that there are thousands of newspapers and 100 news channels across the country, but there are two channels in particular that are causing him more trouble.
These people are damaging their image and reporting unilaterally.
Assam's rights in this case should be protected.
The court refused to stop the media from reporting, but told Asaram's lawyer that he had other legal remedies he could use.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners are struggling with a lack of funds to repair the collapsing highway system, many people are looking for a solution in a small black box that fits neatly on your car's dashboard.
This device, which tracks every mile driven by a motorist and transmits that information to the authorities, has become a controversial topic for Washington and the State Planning Office to restore obsolete systems to finance major U.S. roads these days.
The boring work of highway planning in general has suddenly become a matter of intense debate and lively alliances.
The Liberation Conservatives have joined forces with environmental groups to gather support for allowing the government to use these black boxes to keep track of the miles you drove, and possibly the location you drove - and then use this information to draft a tax bill - to allow the government to use these black boxes.
Tea party is a little bit of a mess.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned about raising a variety of privacy issues.
While Congress has not been able to agree on whether to take further action, many states are not waiting.
They are exploring how they can move into a system in the next decade in which the driver pays for every mile traveled on the road.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black box for the test drive, some of which have GPS monitoring.
This is a truly essential item for our country.
"It's not a matter of whether we choose or not to choose", says Hassan Ikrata, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, which plans to begin tracking every mile driven by motorists in California by 2025.
The way we pay taxes is about to change.
But there is technology to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country's Highway Trust Fund has almost gone bankrupt, financed by taxes paid by U.S. citizens on gas pumps.
Americans no longer buy as much gas as they used to.
Now, in a gallon of gas, the car is moving more miles than ever before.
There has been no increase in federal taxes in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Because of the high price of gas, politicians avoid raising even a penny in taxes.
"Gas tax is not at all portable", says Lee Munich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the mile-per-mile payment system.
"In the long run, this will serve as the most rational option", they say.
HiWonks calls this a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea is appealing to urban liberals, as it could, for example, change taxes to change the way people drive, which could help reduce congestion and even reduce greenhouse gases.
Planners in California are eager to see this system as they develop strategies to meet the goals set out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the chairman of the House Transportation Committee, Rep. Bill Shuster (PA), also considers the black box the most viable long-term option.
Independent vendors at the Region Foundation are also in favor of a mile-by-mile payment by the driver.
"It's not just a tax that's going to a blind hole", said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy in the region.
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. transportation secretaries, who in their 2011 report favored moving toward mile-paying from Congress.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million test project last year, which involved 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural lawmakers, who were representing individuals who had to walk many miles to work or the city every day, the House leadership scrapped the proposal there.
Yet many states and cities are moving in this direction on their own.
Oregon is the most interested in this, having listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon be paying mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state.
Nevada has already completed the preliminary testing.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is experimenting with trucks on a limited basis.
The I-95 Alliance, which includes 17 state transportation departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) along the Eastern Seaboard, is studying how they can implement this change.
This idea was not supported everywhere.
In Nevada, where the device was recently installed on the cars of 50 volunteer drivers, drivers were eager to see if the government could monitor their every move.
Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and task-performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation, says "anxiety about Big Brother and other similar things was a major problem".
This is not something that people wanted.
As the testing progressed, ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "Converting this device into a full-fledged tracking device will be fairly easy".
There is no need to develop a vast, unmanageable technology framework, which must be necessarily spread to keep a record of each person's daily commute.
Nevada is one of many states that is doing its best to get affordable technology that will allow the state to get details of how many miles a day a car is running, but not where and when it is running.
Khan said that if you can do this, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology has brought some state agencies closer to a small California startup called True Mileage.
This firm was not originally in the business of assisting state taxpayers.
It was trying to enter the emerging auto insurance market, where drivers had to pay based on their mileage.
But the device it is testing appealed to highway planners, as it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by the modem at certain time intervals.
"If you don't track people's speed and their location, they'll be more willing to adopt this method", said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.
Some major mistakes have been made in these early programs in the state.
There are also very low-cost and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can choose not to take any devices, but instead choose to pay a fixed fee based on the average miles determined by the state's residents.
Other places hope that this hold can be sold to concerned citizens by providing more convenience rather than less in the device.
In New York City, transportation officials are trying to develop a taxing device that will also allow for paying a parking meter fee, provide "pay per your drive" insurance, and create a collection of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists can use to avoid traffic.
The city planning document states, "motorists will be attracted to participation because of the benefits it will bring".
However, some transportation planners wonder if perhaps the discussion of mile-by-mile payments is a big distortion.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said that Congress can deal with the problem of bankruptcy highway trust funds very easily by increasing gas taxes.
Drivers of hybrid or other cars may also be charged an additional one-time or annual fee, whose vehicles do not use too much gas to pay their fair share.
Randy Rentsheller, Commissioner for Legislation and Public Affairs, said, "When aspirin can be used, what radical surgery is needed for it".
If we do this, then millions of car drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.
Srinagar: The security of former minister Ghulam Hassan Khan, who joined the Congress from the Peoples Democratic Party, has reportedly been removed by the police.
Khan blamed the state government for this, saying that his security has been removed for political reasons.
It is well known that Ghulam Hassan Khan, who won the election in 2002 on the ticket of the PDP from Shopian, was also a member of his cabinet while Mufti Muhammad Saeed was the chief minister.
Ghulam Hasan Khan said that I have been wearing a safety net since 1996.
I live in a shopii called the fortress of terrorists.
A CRPF security squad was stationed at my home, led by a sub-inspector.
I have bodyguards with me, but on Wednesday all my security was suddenly withdrawn.
When the security guard was leaving my home, I spoke to the district deputy commissioner and the district SP.
But instead of restoring security, he simply said he would investigate the case.
However, in this context, when Kashmir's IGP Abdul Ghani Meer was contacted, he denied any information about the matter, saying it was a sensitive matter.
I will personally investigate how the security of a former minister and senior political leader has been removed.
The head of the Rajya Sabha Congress, Prof. Safudeen Sojse, said that there is nothing like this to my knowledge.
If the security of Hassan Khan has been compromised, it is a very serious matter.
I am currently in Jammu and will be coming to Kashmir in a day or two.
I will discuss this issue with the relevant administration.
The Land Rover Rally Series has been announced.
It has racing seats in the interior and a six-point harness belt, as well as an intercom system.
Its options include - upgraded brakes, a service package that provides access to ball work mechanics, logistics assistance, and vehicle collection between events.
Drew Ballor, managing director of Ballor Motorsport, said: "The rally customers that come to Ballor have changed".
They are not all experienced racers, but rather people who are looking for a path to excitement and adventure and a path to world-class events.
We are very pleased to offer this route in partnership with Land Rollerhi and MSA, and we believe that this format provides a new way to experience different rally styles in the UK and abroad, and prepares the competitor for the rigidity and truth of rally raids.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car - it will be a really fun championship.
In addition, Defenderhi Challenger will also offer the option to compete in a training and test day in February, as well as a desert event in North Africa and the Middle East.
The CDC has issued guidelines for schools on childhood allergies.
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines to control food allergies in school children.
This is the first time such guidelines have been issued by the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now, one in 20 children in the U.S. has a food allergy.
The CDC found that between 1997 and 2007, there was an 18 percent increase in food allergy cases among children.
This guidance provides information for schools on how to inform teachers and staff about children's food allergies, and how to handle them in the event of an allergic reaction.
Schools have also been advised to stockpile epinephrine to fight potentially fatal acute myeloma (anaphylaxis) - the most commonly used auto-injector of the epinephrine brand.
The state legislature recently updated the rules, allowing schools to easily stock up on higher amounts of epinephrine.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children with allergic reactions.
Children may say "It feels like something is piercing my tongue", "It feels like there is hair on my tongue", or "It's getting creaky in my tongue".
The rules for aircraft power equipment will remain in effect in Australia right now.
Despite the soft-spoke move in equipment-related regulations in the US, Australian airline passengers will continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones while flying and when landing.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the option open to US airline companies to change their procedures, so that during critical stages of flight passengers can read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices, provided they remain in "airplane" mode.
Passengers can do this during many flights right now, but many people don't like being unable to access their e-book when flying and landing.
Australian airline companies are considering a decision that would require US airline companies to do much to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plans to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was considering the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electrical equipment in critical phases of flight in Australia are still in effect.
"Currently, CASA does not have any specific regulations governing the use of electrical equipment in aircraft", the authority said, "this issue comes under regulations, according to which airline operating companies must ensure that the security system is always fully maintained, and passengers must comply with safety instructions given by crew members".
Virgin, which is already in talks with CASA to expand the use of its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is willing to follow this change, but has asked for further action on the regulator's instructions.
"We would welcome CASA's review of whether to allow the use of electrical equipment, because we really feel it will provide a better experience for customers, as we now have (wireless in-flight entertainment) in our aircraft", a spokesman said.
Quantias said it will comply with current regulations.
It added that "according to our current policy, electrical equipment cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no immediate plans to convert it".
FAhiA's decisions apply to American airlines.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit passengers and we will certainly consider the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will be different for each US aircraft service company and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Airline companies will be required to certify that their aircraft can withstand radio interference from mobile devices, as well as to amend their rulebooks, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and passenger briefing.
"After airlines verify the tolerability of their aircraft, it will allow passengers to use handheld, lightweight electrical devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at all altitudes", the FAhiA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their equipment during the landing.
The group also suggested that heavy equipment be safely placed under the seat or in the upper trunk during takeoff and landing.
The 42 senior leaders of the BJP in Pradesh elected him to the airport.
It is worth noting that Modihi has come to Bihar for a confort trip organized by the BJP.
The BJP is organizing the Consolation Journey as a way to mourn the families of those killed in the blasts in Patna.
It is worth noting that a total of seven explosions were carried out one after another during the Narendra Modi hungar rally in Patna on October 27.
The terrorists of the Indian Mujahideen, who were involved in the explosions, intended to flee during the rally, so that more people would be killed and an atmosphere of terror would be created in the region.
The terrorists' plan failed, but the blasts killed six people.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
The party leaders have taken a trip from their village to visit the village of Kalshahi on Thursday.
On November 5th, the bones of all of them will be flown together into the Ganges in Patna.
As part of this journey, a comfort journey is being organized.
Its main protagonist is Narendra Modi.
They will visit the villages of those killed in the explosions from 7am on Saturday and meet their families.
During this visit, they will also present the relatives of the deceased with a check of Rs.
The BJP has already announced this financial aid.
The accused used to open investors' accounts in the name of buying and selling shares, citing a trading firm.
Possibly: This is the first time in the state that such a disclosure has revealed the fraud of crores of rupees.
The identity of the gang's leader has not yet been reached by the police, but seven people have been detained by the police, including the accused who oversaw his work in the region.
The gang operated a fake commodity market called MetahiTrader-5.
Company creditors would take cash from investors and give it away by creating a fake ID on a fake software.
This allowed the accused to see the shares purchased by investors when trading.
It even found out which shares were bought at what price.
There was no actual purchase of shares or transaction for them, as no de-met account was opened for investors and shares were falsely shown on this fake software.
Police are speculating that hundreds of people have joined the gang.
In the name of making a profit, each investor was required to invest between two and five lakh rupees.
Its main accused Amit Soni has been detained by a cyber cell from Jodhpur, while six other associates have been arrested from Indore.
According to AHIG Cyber Cell Ashok Dual, any stock trading company must be affiliated with the stock exchange as a trading firm.
Only then can the company make stock trading to investors through it.
Then the investor's demathi account is opened, so that shares can be bought and sold for him, but this company, called MetaTrader 5, was neither affiliated with any exchange nor traded in stocks.
The company purchased a server for itself on September 24, 2012 under the name WinTrade, citing trading.
Since then, this company has been deceiving people in the name of investing.
At present, eight Indore businessmen have come forward complaining about the cyber sale.
Even after selling their purchased shares for profit, their funds were not transferred to their account.
At this, he began to demand a profit from the shareholders of the company.
Investors are even saying that the fake ID they were given was always displayed at a lower price than the stock they bought.
This price was determined by the accused at their own level.
The company has appointed its CEO and agents in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Maharashtra.
The agents advised people to join this company by offering them a greater profit.
After this, two lakhs were deposited from someone to five lakh rupees.
Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly admitted that in some cases, US intelligence has exceeded its limits.
He also claimed that innocent people have not been harassed under the intelligence surveillance program.
Kerry's admission came to light through a video link while addressing the annual Open Government Partnership Summit in London.
Kerry said, "I can assure you that innocent people are not being tortured in this process.
But in some cases, inappropriate methods have been adopted in an attempt to obtain information.
Meanwhile, a key committee of the U.S. Parliament has approved a bill restricting the National Security Agency's surveillance activities.
Its purpose is to make surveillance more transparent and restore the trust among people that has been hurt by the disclosure of mass phone tapes.
The Senate's move has been welcomed by six US companies, including Google, Yahoo.
The NSA has also broken into data centers of these companies.
The Senate Committee on the Judiciary on Friday passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Reform Bill [FISA] that was a blow to the NSA by 4 votes to 11.
The bill outlines several restrictions, including a ban on the one-time phone taping under the American Patriot Act.
Using data knowingly and unauthorizedly to collect data under FHIISA would be considered a crime and punishable by up to ten years in prison.
The bill will become law after it passes in both houses of Congress, the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Chairwoman of the committee and Senator Diane Festinhi said that the NSA's program to record phones is under law and I believe it has made a significant contribution to the security of the country.
But despite this, more transparency needs to be brought to it.
Not only that, but the protection of the public's privacy should also be taken care of.
Meanwhile, angered by the NSA's Internet surveillance program's disclosure, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook have backed the bill.
In a letter to senators, these companies have said that they welcome the proposal by lawmakers to curb NSA's mass phone recording.
It is worth noting that the NSA's actions were disguised from the documents released by former CIA employee Edward Snowden.
There is a growing international outrage after the NSA revealed that it was monitoring telephone conversations between heads of state of 35 countries, including Germany and France.
In an unexpected confession, John Kerry said that U.S. espionage "has gone too far inappropriately".
John Kerry has suggested that the U.S.'s defensive attitude toward its surveillance program is being softened by unexpectedly admitting that sometimes its espionage "goes inappropriately far".
The Secretary of State has also admitted that he, along with Barack Obama, is guilty of being on "automatic pilot" as a rebellious manifestation toward Edward Snowden, the NSA's spying spokesman.
This revelation has caused the U.S. government to experience a diplomatic upheaval in relations with its allies.
Speaking via video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Mr Kerry said: "There is no question that the President, myself, and others in the government were actually aware of some of the things that were happening with the autopilot, because looking back, World War II, and the difficult years of the Cold War, and again, certainly 9/11 had the potential for it.
They have become the first senior members of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. intelligence has exceeded its limits, but insisted that no one's rights were abused.
"In some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately", he added.
Both the president and the president are determined to try and make this clear to the public and are currently doing a thorough review so that no one feels abused.
I assure you that there is nothing wrong with innocent people in this process.
Mr. Carey stressed that, however, the NSA was working for good purposes, and its surveillance work has saved many lives.
"We are facing a world where people are ready to blow themselves up", he added.
There is radical extremism in the world, committed to killing people and blowing them up and attacking governments.
So if you can stop it before it happens, what's the problem?
We have saved the plane from actually falling, buildings being torn down, and people being killed because we have been able to know in advance about the plans of others.
Meanwhile, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday said that U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to help address concerns abroad about so-called U.S. espionage, and will try to convince European countries to continue their anti-corruption efforts jointly with the U.S.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threat of their involvement in anti-terrorist organizations due to the National Security Agency's lack of surveillance.
Murphy, the first elected Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview with Washington, "It is really important for the national security interests of the United States that European countries stand with us in our counterterrorism efforts".
... to make it clear to European countries that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger at the NSA program.
Reports of NSA recording millions of phone conversations from Europe have led to a bitter relationship with some of the U.S.'s allies, although the head of the agency said the reports were not entirely accurate, and suggested a misunderstanding of metadata shared with the United Nations by NATO allies.
Other revelations in documents leaked by Snowden suggest that the NSA has monitored the cell phones of 34 other top world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
James Clapper, director of national intelligence, defended the allegation of spying on allies, calling it necessary and saying that it was common for both sides to do so.
Amid the riots, Murphy said his office was arranging a congressional visit that is likely to take place this year, and he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other lawmakers who participated will be released in the coming days.
He said that work on the itinerary is still underway.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, he said some "impractical relationships" would also have to be abandoned.
He said that European leaders would have to be honest with their people, and with their spy programs that have been used for years.
"While we can revise our surveillance program to better protect the rights of Europeans, they too need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying", Murphy said.
Meanwhile, this weekend, Mr. Carey is scheduled to visit the Middle East and Poland, where he will address issues ranging from U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt, and Iran to U.S. surveillance activities.
The NSA accused the website of being crashed by an "internal error" rather than hackers.
The mystery National Security Agency said Friday that our website was shut down for a few hours due to some technical deficiency, not because of hackers as some claimed online.
The intelligence agency said in an emailed statement, "NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight, due to an internal error during the pre-scheduled update".
This evening, the problem will be solved.
This claim is not true that this obstacle, distributed denial of service [DDOS] attack was caused.
On the evening of this week, online server trackers discovered that the NSA website had been down for at least six hours, and that the site was still inaccessible to some users.
An NSA spokesman told ABC News that there was "absolutely no" agreement with the agency's internal, sensitive network.
A spokesman for the company said no classified information is at risk.
At least one hacking group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the NSA website through a DDOS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed in such a way that the target website receives such a large amount of traffic until the site is shut down due to server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively unfinished and attacks are not intended to intercept the internal networks of the target system.
The former highly secretive NSA, once dubbed "no agency like this", has been the subject of much public discussion and fierce criticism over the past few months over the revelation of a large number of foreign and domestic spy programs - which collectively erupted after the agency seized and expropriated secret NSA files by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
Due to this growing controversy about the agency, speculation was made after the incident tonight that the incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
A firefighter was called to rescue a lost puppy at the foot of a dangerous mountain 50 feet above ground in a mine.
Cocker Spaniel Ruby had fled after being hit by a small road collision.
Three days later, he was spotted by a dog walker trapped in a mine.
Firefighters lowered the front of the rock from the rope to protect the dog from death.
After somehow being trapped by Papi at the foot of a dangerous mountain 50 feet above the ground, the call to the fire department gave him a lucky life.
Nine-month-old cocker Spaniel Ruby, who ran away after a road accident on Sunday afternoon, spent three days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
Their owner Scott Elderson, 25, and their girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, Denham, were in the Flappit Mine in West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again, and they have thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After running away after a minor accident, he had gone madly searching for his lost dog, and an appeal was posted on social networking sites.
At 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-eyed dock walker spotted Ruby on a mountain in a mine at 50 feet above ground.
A technical rescue team from Clackheaton Fire Station arrived at the scene and used a tube to pull Ruby down by rope to save her and a stomach tube to bring her down from the rock.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue officer, said: "She was in a critical situation.
She was in the middle of the front part of the rock, 50 feet above and below.
He did not make a single move during the rescue, she remained stone.
But now she's fine.
After that she was eating biscuits.
This was an unusual cry for help.
But even seeing a dog is incredible.
Peter Law, Special Technical Rescue Officer, said: "Ruby is fortunate to have survived".
He was likely to have been seriously injured or in worse condition.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for examination, where she was found to be fine, besides fatigue and dehydration.
Miss Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire said: "It was terrible to see the rescue".
At first I couldn't believe how she got there.
It's amazing to have her back in your hands.
The vet said that if she got too tired and fell, she would definitely fall down.
The fire department did a great job.
What they did was truly a very courageous act.
We are grateful to them, and they were all great.
Mr. Elderson also said of Keighley: "We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there".
The fire department did a great job.
I can't believe how she got there.
This caused the plaintiffs to be in trouble.
Addressing the meeting held on this occasion, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed his deep outrage at the deteriorating law and order in the region.
He said the rapidly increasing attacks on lawyers and their families prove that the perpetrators have gone rogue.
They are no longer afraid of the police or the administrative system.
He also mentioned recent incidents like this in different places, saying that when an advocate society is not safe, the security of the common man can easily be guessed.
Frontier Airlines will charge for carry-on luggage.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 for carrying luggage for passengers on board its aircraft.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging $100 for a carry-on bag and it will charge $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday indicated that passengers can carry the entire bag.
The new carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin, so small bags under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if paid in advance, $100 to wait if passengers wait to pay until they are at the gate.
Katie O'Malley, a spokeswoman for Frontier, said the $100 fee is to be earned to care for the charges in advance of passengers.
"We don't want to charge him", they said.
Hi Airlines began charging for first and second checking bags in 2008.
Those who are trying to avoid passenger charges are filling as much as they can in carry-on luggage which is stashed in the overhead box, which means that this box often has less space.
The fee is a way to bring less for passengers on board.
O'Malley said the new charge isn't really about raising money.
It is for the most loyal customers about Frontier that finding a replacement for the Overhead Binhi has become increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay for it.
This means that the next person in line may have to pay $100 for a similar bag, while a passenger in line at a frontier gate can get a bag for free.
O'Malley said that Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to ensure passengers are aware of the fees before they reach the gate.
The new Frontier Carrier - on Fee, will not start until summer although a date has not been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction with baggage charges and other charges, but airlines prefer them.
They argue that it costs money to handle luggage, and those who want passenger service should pay for it.
The baggage fees on Wall Street are seen by many as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most of them, though, haven't even touched the carry-on bag fees.
Spirithihi Airlines Inc. first launched the carrier - on-duty three years ago, and partner discount Allegiant Air later.
One such fee is accompanied by Hungary's Wizz Air, which airline adviser J. Sorenhi said, and which tracks ad-on fees.
He said that Spirit's carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year, which was estimated in a December 2011 report.
Soehrensen, a former Midwest Airlines officer, recently flew in Spirit and surprised passengers that they had to face an unusual baggage charge at the gate.
"The hi-boarding process I'd seen in my airline career was straightforward", he said.
I was hoping to grind my teeth and look out at a battle gate.
"The plane was full and they said it was lickety-split".
Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier says that any passenger who takes soda, or juice can keep a whole can, and will give this free coffee only for once.
It will still give away water.
UShi Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but seven months later after passengers complained they backed down and followed any other major airline after being there.
If Frontier's passengers do not purchase directly from the airline, Frontier's move to charge for carriage-on is its latest effort to drive customers to its own website.
Airline subsidiaries pay online travel seller Orbitz such as $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
That's why all airlines have been encouraged to operate passengers to buy directly from them rather than through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has moved ahead in this area.
In September, many began to give up half a mile of frequent flyer for customers who had purchased from these individuals from an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it lowered the mileage award by 25 percent for the trip mile.
So, a 1000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn 250 miles.
It also allows for the sole passengers to choose their seat in advance when purchasing directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in his hometown of Denver, but its business is dwindling and it is losing money.
HI revenue fell 9 percent and its flight capacity decreased by about 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by parent corporate Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
As part of the sale of Republic Airlines, Frontier is trying to settle its finances.
The Chinese newspaper that makes the argument will be "restored".
A Chinese newspaper that had appealed on the front page to release a reporter guilty of defamation will be restored, a press regulator said.
Guangzhou's New Express newspaper had offered a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But after that Mr. Chen admitted on television that he had taken bribes to write a cover story about a state-owned company.
The regulator said that New Express now has to go through a "complete reform".
The order for "hi reform" came from the Guangdong Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
"A preliminary investigation revealed that the New Express of Yangcheng Evening News Group had published a lot of false news about the listed company Joomlayin between September 2012 and August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that "the editorial management of New Express was chaotic".
It said it had decided to "impose an administrative penalty by revoking the license of Chen Yongzhou's reporter".
It had "directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to complete a complete overhaul of the New Express, suggesting that the New Express investigate those responsible for it and immediately revise the New Express leadership team".
Mr. Chen wrote many articles in the New Express blaming financial irregularities at a construction equipment company called ZoomLoyne.
After his ban was lifted, his newspaper published two front-page appeals for his release, saying he supports Mr. Chen's journalism.
But after that Mr. Chen came on state television, admitting to writing and publishing fake stories for money.
He told state broadcaster CCTV that "in this case I have damaged ZoomLoyne as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win the trust of the people".
I did this mainly because I was greedy for money and fame.
I have come to realize my mistakes.
After Mr. Chen apologized, New Express issued a front-page apology, saying it had failed to properly investigate his report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have admitted to the TV broadcast.
Experts say that from time to time, convictions are enforced, despite a law earlier this year prohibiting authorities from forcing a person to plead guilty.

The players of this team keep setting new records on the day of the Test and now their standings are gradually rising even in ODIs.
A good example of this was also seen on Thursday when the well-known New Zealand team Bangladesh took the title after a run of one-day series and an unbeaten lead.
With the sharp bowling of Sohi Sohag Gazi and Musharfeemurtza, Bangladesh defeated New Zealand by 40 runs in the second ODI to secure an unbeaten 2-0 lead in the three-match series.
This is Bangladesh's sixth consecutive win against New Zealand in ODI cricket.
Earlier, New Zealand had lost the series 0-4 on their 2010 tour of Bangladesh.
Chasing Bangladesh's 248 runs target, New Zealand lost their wickets at regular intervals to the stormy bowling of Gazi (34/3) and Murtaza (43/3) at a spin, stacking the team to 207 runs in 46.4 overs.
Ross Taylor for New Zealand scored the most, 45, while Corey Anderson scored 37.
Kyle Mills went undefeated with 27, while Nathan McCullum contributed 25 runs, but no batsman from the team could turn a good start into a big innings which caused the team to lose.
Earlier, Bangladesh team were bowled out for 247 in 49 overs despite the half-century of Tamim Iqbal (58).
Anderson and James Nisham took eight wickets together.
Anderson scored 40 runs with four, while Neesham took four wickets with 53 runs.

Police have recovered from the accused's possession fake registries, fake seals, laptops and photocopies of fake registries.
Mohiti Nagar Police has filed a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said that the arrested accused included Rajiv Agarwal aka Bintu of the Habowal-based Chand Nagar, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Gumar Mandy, Gurinder Singh Gaggy of Kohara and Sonu of Gumar Mandy.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar's Office (East) has escaped the scene.
According to the police, the accused worked with the clerk and recordkeeper of the Registrar's office Balbir Singh to extract documents from the records of empty and old land and then to buy new stamp papers and create a fake registry on them.
Not only that, but they would then disappear the real registry and upload it to the fake registry records.
After that, the accused sold the land on fake paper for crores of rupees.
At the same time, these counterfeit paperwork borrowers took out loans.
After that, the real owner of the land was a check on the police and administration.
The accused, who had prepared the fake register, were keeping a close eye on NRIG's land.
Because there was no one to look after NRIG's land.
So it is easy to create a fake registry of those lands and sell them.
Police Commissioner Gilhi said that the accused said in the interrogation that they had prepared nearly 150 fake registrations so far.
According to the police, the gang's leader Rajiv has already been charged with fraud and theft.
Children should be taught "myths and legends" as "a model for the author's way of life".
Thorhi's stories could show that "cruel power has no match for subtle moves", while Arthurian legends show the importance of having a dream.
Even to teach many of the myths "exceptionally far and away wild and in some cases pornographic and it would not be appropriate to teach it in schools", Cross Lee Holland advocated "carefully selecting" one of the age-appropriate works.
"I find it surprising that in America, myths and folktales are already part of education", he said.
I have been sponsoring this as a plan for twenty years.
He has called writers and teachers "more educational" and this is "a new turn" for children, as well as messages being "presented" in entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote a penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folktales, said: "You may have many intentions but it would be better to keep it out of sight".
Perhaps the big difference between writing an adult writer for a child and writing an adult writer for an adult takes some sense of hope.
Everything is supposed to be simplified or to have a happy ending, because it is a natural sense of good and evil.
And said that it should be submitted, rather than revealed through a story.
The old one is not showing any basis.
BJP Prime Minister candidate Narendra Modi, who arrived in Pune to inaugurate a part of the Dinanthi Mangeshkar Hospital, on Friday, while addressing an election rally, launched a sharp attack on the Congress.
Modi said on the occasion, 'In many states and centers of the country, sometimes a coalition government, sometimes a Congress government, sometimes a Communist government, sometimes a BJP government.
You've seen the rule of many parties.
I call upon the political pundits, economists of the country.
Some parameters should be set in the country.
What did the party do?
If the comparison results are achieved, the country will not have to face the question of whether or not the BJP government should come.
Wherever the BJP has formed a government, there has been an effort to fulfill the aspirations of the people.
This country has witnessed the inflation rate being low in the governments of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man was given food twice.
But when the Congress or a government supported by it came into being, the poor man was not fortunate enough to be fed a lot.
Not a single leader of the Congress, not a single leader of the UPA, is answering what he has done in nine and a half years.
Even the media in our country can't reach them.
Congress has become arrogant.
They don't even respond to the media.
The elections are for the Lok Sabha, you answer the people.
Modi attacked Congress leader Kapil Sibal, saying, 'These days Modi is being questioned.In 2014, when the people bless the BJP, he will give an account of his work to the public every year.
In a democracy, the ruler should sit, not the servant, in Delhi.
There can be no Nathhi in Delhi, there should only be slaves.
Congressional friends keep dropping balloons every day.
Congressional friends, we have already passed the exam 10 months ago.
In a democracy, the people are the ones who take the exam.
In the wake of the Lok Sabha elections, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi finally extended his cabinet on Friday to include 6 new ministers.
The ceremony of the oath ceremony of the Indian leaders was held today at the Mahatma Temple in Gandhinagar.
Governor Kamal Beniwal has sworn in the newly appointed Jashwant Singh Bhambhor, Dilip Rathod, Chhatra Singh Mori, Jayay Radhiya, Vasannbhaai Ahir and Jayadrath Singh Parmar.
During the swearing-in ceremony, besides Chief Minister Modi, a large number of activists were present, including senior BJP leaders Amit Shah, Parshottam Rupala.
It is also likely that the meeting will see two state-level ministers upgraded to cabinet status and some ministers' responsibilities changed.
This has led to a decline in the number of cases of violations of the Code of Conduct.
Since the entry into force of the electoral code of conduct on October 4, 313 cases have been registered against various political parties up to October 21.
From October 22 to 27, only 31 cases were reported.
With the coming into force of the Electoral Code of Conduct, cases of violation of the Code of Conduct also began to arise.
In the early days, there were more complaints, but the number has declined.
It is reported that in the early days, there were more complaints against political parties because of the lack of complete knowledge about the code of conduct.
The fact that the Election Commission has been raising awareness among political parties and has learned lessons from the case has led to fewer complaints.
Many parties were campaigning as before without information, but when action was taken against them, they banned it.
Political parties are following it with knowledge of the electoral code of conduct.
This has also reduced the number of violations.
Sudhi said the cleaning system in the city, street lights have completely failed.
No action is being taken by the municipal corporation and Huda to run the city centre of Panchhikula.
He has demanded that Panchkula abolish the household tax altogether.
Addressing a press conference here on Friday, VK Sud said that after the municipal elections, the city has received new councillors and mayors, but they do not have the power to get the job done.
As a result, the city council has become a dummy and the officials are acting on their own.
Sood said that the municipal corporation has crores of rupees in its possession, but all the money is being collected by depositing it in the form of FD in banks.
No action is being taken to invest money in the development of the city.
V.K. Sood said that the problem of doping ground is the most serious.
The establishment of a doping ground in Sector 23 has forced people living in the gigantic cross-sectors to live a hellish life for the past several years.
Municipal officials have been talking about shifting the doping ground in the village of Zhuriala for the past several years, but people in the Barwala area are already suffering from a serious problem with flies.
He said that the healthcare and education system in the villages had deteriorated considerably.
To date, no work has been started to provide facilities to people in the rural areas.
Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 77, known for his bungalow parties, has secretly married a 28-year-old girl.
This disclosure was made by his family friend Martel Polanski.
According to him, Berlusconi, who has served three times as prime minister, has married former TV anchor Francesca Pascal in her private chapel.
Francesca's first meeting with Balucci was when she was a teenage activist in the Forza Italia party.
It is Francesca, whose relationship with Balrusconi was said to be a sham.
Berlusconi's close friend and bungalow-girl Martelle Polanco has revealed that she too was invited to this secret wedding.
The ceremony took place three weeks ago.
In a revelation on Italian Radio2, when asked what would happen if they both got married, Polanco said they were already married.
This was not a public ceremony.
The wedding took place in a private chapel in the former prime minister's home.
No one can tell you anything else.
Although she did not attend the wedding.
They have sent their congratulations to the newlyweds.
The two were married about three weeks ago, on October 8 or 9.
About eight months ago, a 28-year-old woman 50 years younger than himself was engaged to Francesca Pascalhi.
To avoid the appearance of a grumpy face, Berlusconi had based his decision on loneliness.
Water purifiers have been offered by the Du Guard Company for clean drinking water at the Walmiqi temple, the god of the new Nagalhi.
A representative of the company, who received the water purifier from the temple on behalf of the skilled and fragrant J.K.hi, said that this act of social service is commendable, as the devotees who come to the temple will now be able to use clean drinking water.
This time, Asaram, who is being held in judicial custody in the Central Prison for allegedly sexually assaulting a minor student, will be held in the Diwali jail.
Apart from Jodhpur, Asaram is also accused of raping a girl from Surat.
Meanwhile, his son Narayan Saihi is running away from the police.
And therefore, now the Gujarat police have also issued an arrest warrant against him.
There are also reports from Ahmedabad that the trustees of the Asaram have also begun to gradually shy away from the tax asaram.
Besides, now action is also being taken on Ashrams in Assam, which are built illegally or on government land.
We have already told you that the Asaramhi has more than 400 ashrams.
One of these ashrams is also in New Jersey, USA.
Ashiaram and his son are being accused of various kinds of crimes.
Yet the superstition of many of his devotees is not over.
Ashiaram has a similar dominance not only in India but also in the US.
Asaram in India may be in prison and devotees may be getting away from them, but not in America at all.
In the Ashram of New Jersey, devotees are still visiting the Asaram as before.
Scientists have shed further light on the connection between the dog's tail movements and its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs move their tail more to the right (from a dog's point of view), while restless dogs move their tail more to the left mainly.
But now scientists say that fellow dogs can recognize this subtle distinction of the tail and react to it.
The study was published in the journal Current Biology.
Professor Georgia Vellertigra, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "In humans, it is well known that the left and right hemispheres of the brain are involved in different ways in the excitement that generates positive or negative emotions".
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
He pointed out that in dogs, like humans, the right side of the brain was responsible for left-hand gestures and the opposite order, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to unilateral commutation by other dogs, researchers watched other dogs' movies and watched animals.
They measured the heart rate of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't take long for us to understand why their tummy sometimes moves one way and sometimes the other.
"We introduced dogs with dog movies - in a realistic version or in a shots to deal with other confusing issues, and we could see the tail movement and present the tail more to the left or right", said Professor Vellertigrahi.
When the animals saw a dog with no sense of humour moving its tail to the right (in the dog's eyes), they were completely relaxed.
But when they saw the tail shifting in direction and turning mainly to the left (again from the dog's point of view), their heartbeat increased and they looked restless.
According to Professor Wellertigra, they do not think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these actions.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their experience what they should be concerned about and not what they should be concerned about.
"If you've met other dogs several times, and if they keep moving their tail to one side, it's related to more friendly behavior, and the right side presents less friendly behavior, you react based on the same experience", he said.
The researchers say that these findings can provide owners, veterinarians and trainers with better information about the emotions of animals.
John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, said this is not the first study to examine whether the left or right side is important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that when dogs see an aggressive dog, they turn their head to the left and turn their head to the right when they see a happy dog.
In another study by the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: "Unlike an Italian study - when a robot dog's tail was moved to the left rather than the right, dogs were more likely to get close to it rather than be restless".
He said that the difference was because in various studies dogs in movies did not fully understand animals or robot dogs as dogs.
He explained that studying how dogs react to real dogs can help.
"While there is considerable evidence from different mammals that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is yet to be obtained - and in this case dogs are no exception", he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it seems that it probably won't take us long to understand why their curve sometimes moves one way or the other.
New research has shown that we work in the morning with complete honesty and dedication.
They do not lie to anyone and the idea of stealing or cheating does not come to mind.
But as the evening approaches, our minds change and we set aside ideals and start to walk against the rules.
In this research from Harvard University and the David Eccles School of Business at Utah, researchers have revealed several interesting facts.
According to researchers, we prefer moral values when we are not stressed at work in the morning, but when we are tired or under pressure in the evening, honesty decreases.
For this purpose, the researchers conducted two experiments.
He asked a few people to tell him the number of dots on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell if the point is higher to the left or to the right.
Participants were told that if they gave a wrong answer instead of the right answer, they would be paid.
This experiment showed that the people who were tested between 8 and 12 a.m. made no mistakes and gave correct answers.
While experimenting on people between noon and 6 p.m., it was found that they deliberately misrepresented their answers by keeping their roots on the line.
This has led researchers to prove that greed for money does not affect our honesty in the morning, but as evening approaches we stop paying attention to morality.
This research has been published in the latest issue of Psychological Science.
The Punjab State Power Corporation, which earns crores of rupees a day, is currently operating in the Gate City Circle office ruins building.
In such a situation, all employees are forced to work in fear of accidents.
The staff working on the building's roof fell from cement on the day of the attack, and there is a panic.
Built in 1913 during the British era, this building housed the first municipal corporation office.
In 1995, the building was handed over to the Electricity Board.
The department is covering the palladium by simply making the paint paint painted in the name of its repair.
The condition of this building has become so bad that employees are afraid to even sit in it.
The condition of the building is so bad that plaster often falls from the roofs.
In the last month alone, cement has fallen from the roofs of four rooms.
A female employee has also been injured as a result.
In this accident, GE and the Revenue Accountant, child-child survived.
Currently, about four and a half hundred employees work in the building.
This includes 5 XEN, 12 SDOs, 20 junior engineers, 130 clerical staff, 200 technical staff and 20 other staff members, including SEhi.
The fact is that nothing has been done yet on their safety by Powercom high officials.
Three rooms, a scooter and bicycle stand, have been allocated to JE's in the building, and two rooms on the upper floor have completely collapsed.
In such a situation, the condition of the building can be easily estimated.
Coulson used phone hacking to confirm classified information.
Andy Colson, former editor of the News of the World, has been accused of using "phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face" in an attempt to confirm a so-called classified information about their romantic relationships while he was home secretary to Charles Clark.
Prosecutor Andrew Addis QC told Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clark was meeting with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Polby.
The court said the newspaper hired private investigator Glen Mulcair to hack into Polby's voice mail and "watch" the man, but Colson called and dropped his voice mail.
Mr. Addis said that "the prosecution suggests that Mr. Colson, who is currently the editor of NOTW, is not known to stand outside people's homes and watch them, but rather to put articles in front of people, to see how people react to him".
He said that the N.O.T.W. used three methods to investigate cases: phone hacking, surveillance, and face-to-face.
The third included self-edited editors.
It is obvious that he knew about other methods, the Nigerian way, he certainly knew.
What about the first one?
Did he know about phone hacking?
"No", they say, "we're saying, "yes, he knew".
The rumor about Clarke's affairs was first reported by the A.O.T.W. feature desk when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles".
In August 2006, from Mulcare's home, a voice mail tape was seized from Ms. Polby's phone at least three times.
Investigators also found entries in the private investigator's computer that had named Ms. Polby and her sister "Project".
During the period of their investigation, Ms. Polhihi's grandparents were called anonymously to ask for information about them.
During this time, former chief reporter Nevely Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup watched over Ms. Polby's in-and-out surveillance.
On 18 June 2005, Colson sent him a voice mail message saying: "I have a story that we are planning to run tomorrow, and I would definitely like to talk to Charles about it".
Mr. Addis said that Colson's involvement in the case is in the hands of other important figures, such as former Home Secretary David Blanket.
The bench heard Thursday that Colson had conversed with Mr. Blanket about romantic relationships with a married woman, while at the time he was handling the case of co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Colson & Brooks declined to confuse with others for hacking phones between October 3, 200 and August 9, 2006.
Mulkier, Thorlbeck and WeatherUp have admitted to hacking the phone.
Enthusiastic about the explosive victory in the last match, the Indian team will be aiming to capture the series with a win on Saturday when they land in the seventh and final ODI against Australia at the M Chinnahi Swamy Stadium.
India had to win the Nagpur ODI in any case to stay in the series after two ODIs in a row were washed away by rain and its batsmen gave it a record victory, with their performances explosive, which led the team to draw 2-2 in the series.
In the series, Team India has twice achieved the target of over 350 runs twice and once again the responsibility of crossing the team's navel will be on the batsmen.
Indian batting is currently at its peak and even the biggest goal is proving to be a dwarf in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in great form, but the team will also have high expectations from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja.
As for the opening, the team has received a pair of opener pairs as Rohit and Shikharhi, which is making it easier for the rest of the batsmen to work with a solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he had a great partnership in the opening, giving Virat the chance to play without any pressure.
Kohli's performance so far at number three has made him the future Sachin Tendulkar.
Rather, many cricket pundits have called him even better than Sachin.
Virat, who will turn 25 next week, has scored 17 ODI centuries, of which India has won 16.
His average of 80.00 points per game while pursuing the goal has emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in strong form, but excessive reliance on them can also be detrimental to the team.
Rainahi and Yuvraj were badly flopping in the last match.
Yuvraj has not even been able to open an account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, a good innings in the Bengal ODI could be a lifeline for him.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsmen, especially captain George Bailey, have impressed everyone with their performance.
He is also being asked to be included in the Test squad for the domestic Ashes series against England.
Australia have good batsmen up to number nine.
Besides Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Vogue and James Faulkner have also batted well in the series.
However, Phil Hughes and Aaron Finch have not been able to leave any impression in the opening.
The lack of Michael Johnson in bowling could be a huge blow to Australia.
Johnson, who has so far performed well in the Ashes series, has been sent home to prepare for the Ashes series.
The dream of fireworks traders of trading in the fireworks market located in the transportation area of the city has not come true.
The fireworks traders have been trapped in the midst of a high court order.
Neither can they trade in the temporary fireworks market built at Ranjit Avenue anymore, nor have they been issued a license to trade in the transportation area.
The commission, constituted by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, during its visit declared the temporary fireworks market located at Ranjit Avenue unsafe.
The Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar was also fined a million rupees for not having made proper arrangements there.
The High Court has in its order strongly reprimanded the administrative authorities of Amritsar for what such an administration has done that for nine years has failed to solve even a single problem of fireworks traders.
They could not be given a proper place in the city.
After this, the appropriate security management tax was ordered to issue licenses to fireworks traders to trade only in the market located in Naipagarh.
After this order, although the fireworks traders were happy, the police turned their cheers on Friday.
A team from the Asalhahi Police License Branch reached the fireworks market and set up a counter there to sell the farm.
It was then impossible to fulfill the conditions that were then set for him in one day.
Anup Kumar, in charge of the ASLHA license branch, AHI ACP East Gaurav Garg, SHO Sultanwind Arun Sharma Pataka market has arrived at the market.
He expressed his dissatisfaction with the arrangements made by the fireworks traders.
Therefore, fireworks traders were not issued licenses.
There is one day left to Diwali.
This has caused fireworks traders to be upset.
They are facing a loss of crores of rupees.
The fireworks businessman Abhinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desaraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni have said that if they suffered a loss of crores of rupees, they would sue the district administration.
Angry fireworks traders marched on Friday night from the shipwreck to Ranjit Avenue.
He shouted against the police and the district administration.
After that, the temporary fireworks market that was running on Ranjit Avenue also closed.

It is true that without money our work cannot go on.
Money is one of the greatest needs for survival, but it is not in our best interests to take it for granted.
We celebrate the Krishna Trilogy of Karthik month on Dhanteras.
Dhanhi Theras is worshipped as the god of wealth, Kuber, and the god of death, Yama Raj.
Money has an important place in our religion and in our lives.
No money is good or bad.
For better or worse, it is our feelings for money.
There can be no more valuable thing than wealth that has served the welfare of mankind, but the wealth that has caused pride is meaningless.
We should earn money for holy purposes and spend it for holy purposes.
It is the duty of every individual to earn money to support his family.
Some of this should also be a sense of spending on society, but the tendency to make money in an unreasonable amount of savings or yen-ken-style destroys our conscience, personality.
The spirit of charity should always be in the mind.
Even a fraction of the money you give can be the basis of someone's survival.
We should all think about the many people in this society who are living in dire poverty.
In fact, in the manushastra of life, meaning, religion, work and salvation are given equal importance.
All people wish for wealth and success and according to their masculinity they also get wealth and success.
The same wealth is lasting, with which honour is associated.
No criminal, however rich, can use it properly or benefit anyone else.
Don't hate someone else who has wealth.
The real rich are those who make the way for wealth to flow into the hands of countless people.
No one else can use money more effectively than creating jobs for others.
Moreover, money is not merely a form of currency.
It also happens in terms of your health, character, love for others.
Try to become the owner of this wealth.
The human population has now exceeded 7 billion.
If the population growth continues in this way, soon there will be a time when it will be difficult to raise funds for every hungry person.
According to experts, in the near future humans will have no choice but to eat insects and mice.
According to reports, a group of students at Montreal-based McGill University won the Halt Award for a unique project this year.
He has been awarded the prize for preparing protein-rich flour made from insect larvae.
As a reward, he has been given a grant of $1 million to further his research and experiments.
In an interview with ABC News on September 30, the group's chief student researcher, Mohammad Ashorhi, said that his team will now be experimenting with locusts for food.
This report provides detailed information about edible worms and mice.
The STIH Special Task Force (STF) has revealed that the PMT of 2012 was falsified a day earlier.
The Shi STF has found a disturbance in the roll number of 700 students in the investigation.
About 125 of these students had been admitted to medical colleges.
Now admission for these students may be canceled.
Following the disclosure of the SHI STF, the Department of Medical Education has begun a rally to cancel admission for these students.
According to the information, the department is waiting for the STF to meet the list of all these suspected students.
The list will be sent to the WAPAMHI to cancel the eligibility of the students involved.
However, the Department is also talking about seeking legal advice in this matter.
Departmental officials say that students entering the year 2012 have completed one year, so it is important to seek legal advice in this matter.
As the case is currently confined to an STF investigation, officials at the Department of Medical Education are not in a position to say anything.
The WAPHI Director, Tan Pithore, says that if the STF presents a list of suspected students with evidence, their admission will be immediately canceled.
Director of Medical Education Dr. Nirbhay Srivastava said that the students' admission has not been denied if they are found to be correct to have a fake admission.
According to SHI STF officials, fake students enrolled in the 2012 PMT are being investigated.
After the investigation, the list of suspected students will be handed over to the WAPAMHI.
It is worth noting that the Wampamhi had revoked the eligibility of 345 suspected students who took the PMT exam in 2013.
Of the 345 schools, 84 have been canceled by the Department of Medical Education.
A new anti-nicotine vaccine may end the enjoyment of smoking.
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can eliminate the fun of smoking.
The same dose of the vaccine, the same dose, was able to keep mice safe from nicotine addiction for life.
Further testing is needed before human trials can begin, which may take years, but Ronald Crystal, a professor at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said that the tear signals are positive.
Professor Cornell said, "We have high hopes that this type of vaccine strategy can eventually help millions of smokers who have tried to quit using all the methods available on the market today, but they have found that their addiction to nicotine is far more powerful than these existing methods".
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which has been designed to transmit genetic information with the aim of creating anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to make a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies detect any nicotine molecules in the blood, and by inactivating them before reaching the brain, they prevent the need for nicotine from rising inside the smoker.
In the trial, vaccinated mice, who were later given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
But the researchers say that the rat that was not vaccinated "feel good", a sign that the nicotine had reached his brain.
This experiment was described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The tobacco vaccines of the past failed because they contained antibodies.
It required regular dosing to maintain antibody levels, but proved expensive and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be high, as liver cells will become a factory of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they were tempted to smoke, thus preventing them from becoming addicted to nicotine.
But it is likely to be used by smokers to quit smoking.
"They will find that if they start smoking again they will not have any enjoyment of smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which can help them to quit their habit", he said.
British scientists described the results as interesting, but warned that much more research was needed.

When a crowd of experts gathered in Cardiff to show off the horse for the best horse of the year, they knew it was going to be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even going to school yet and a few months away from taking her first step, this little child and her pet Tattoo Taffy from Shetland completed three stages with great ease and won the top prize - she outran her 30 adult competitors.
At the annual competition organised by the Sunnyback Equestrian Centre in Roadry, near Cardiff, the indistinguishable pair - who are Skhi's length - were highly praised for their appearance, behaviour and style.
In front of men and women wearing beautiful bowler hats, she tilted her flat hat at a slight angle and turned her two-year-old toffee around the ring.
The decision-makers praised Fenton for his natural ability to control the fluid, which is well beyond his age.
And Tofihi got the highest score for her appearance and personality.
Fenton was given a toffee as a gift on her third birthday last March, and she has practiced with this Shetland tattoo every day since then.
His 30-year-old mother, Donnahi, said: "Fenton and Toffy are a great pair".

"The whole place was filled with excitement, and everyone was cheering and clapping", said Mrs. Howells.
He was running on the sand all over the theater, and despite his small appearance, he did an extraordinary job.
Fenton is a wild animal lover - he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has raised two chickens to care for.
The kind of start he has made will be at the best horse show of the year long before - and I am sure he will perform very well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three years old, but he has to control his tattoos".
They are a very good couple.
The judges scored points based on Fenton and Toffey's performance and their performance in the show ring.
They saw good teamwork between Tattū and his rider - in this case Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's cute clothes helped her, she looked really different.
The UN has set new targets to combat poverty.
The United Nations is immediately about to begin work on a new set of targets, which will replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
To replace the MDD, which expires in 2015, the Australian diplomat played a key role in pushing forward the "Conductible Development Goals" just before the overnight start of the Conductible Development Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
These were included in the final draft of the document, which will be endorsed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
At the UN General Assembly, Ban Ki-moon said it was time to "rise above national interests".

A tax on foreign property owners will end London's artificial status.
The Department of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measures, but is awaiting final decision from Mr Osborne, who introduced a stamp duty rate of 7 per cent in the 2012 budget for houses worth more than £2 million, and for individuals who prefer to have a house in a company rather than a single person.
The stamp duty on residential property in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea in the tax year 2012/13 was £708 million, which is already more than the combined sum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber.
Mr Cook said: "After the increase in stamp duty on high-value homes and the introduction of the Associated Anti-Avoidance Act, it is very difficult to argue that high-value property is taxed at a lower rate than is reasonable, which has nothing to do with the impact of the outdated council tax system.
He added that "but this move may make some foreign investors reluctant to sell to current owners who have remained silent about buying properties in London".
The premium property, which is a wealthy property in south-west London and has a top 5 to 10 percent share of the housing market by value, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has grown by a record 11.8 percent last year.
According to research by Sahiviles, central London's prices continued to grow at a regular rate of 5.6 percent each year, but appeared to be slightly lower than the rising "domestic market", as the city's southwest, north (7.4 percent) and east (6.5 percent) were booming.
With the arrival of Diwali, the demand for sweets increases.
This leads to an increase in sales of cheap and fake maves.
Chemicals are used to make the sweethi brighter, more colorful and sweeter, which is dangerous to health.
The Food and Drug Administration has launched a campaign against counterfeit foods and chemical sweets.
The department seized 70,000 Mawa from Madhya Pradesh and 5,000 Lash from Quetta Colony.
As the demand for sweets in the market has increased, so has the demand for low-grade maize from Madhya Pradesh.
The information department received information about bringing the dirty, dirty Mave from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
A shipment of Mawe is being imported from the transport garage Naghipur.
The department seized the mave, which was estimated to cost Rs 70,000.
Fear of action did not justify anyone in the case.
The Department of Justice considered it an unclaimed property and destroyed it.
The department raided the Jitendra Caters in Quetta Colony and recovered about 5,000 glitters.
A chemical called sodium hydrous sulfide was used to keep the sparkle shining and to last longer.
The sample will be sent to the laboratory.
The department's co-commissioner, SS Deshmukh, said that the campaign to catch chemical sweets and bad and fake mashed potatoes will continue.
The department has informed the campaign to be stepped up in the next few days.
Consumption of these sweets can also lead to poisoning.
The department asked the confectioners to make a dessert from good milk, maize.
The appeal has been made to the public on behalf of the department to beware of fake sweets and noodles.
He believed in Egypt's first freely elected president.
Mohamed Morsi has taken the oath of office, but on the day of his victory he could hardly end the political conflict in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammad Morsi, when taking oath as the country's first freely elected president, promised a "new Egypt" when he replaced Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted 16 months ago.
On his formal inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi has become the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world, and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the monarchy was overthrown nearly 60 years ago.
He took the oath of office on his chair before 18 judges in black robes at the courthouse on the banks of the Nile, which looked like an ancient Egyptian temple.
During a ceremony shown live on national television, Morsi said, "We are looking forward to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic".
The radical Muslim Brotherhood, which has been an outlawed organization for 84 years since its founding, and which has been targeted by previous governments, said Morsi, 60, a U.S.-trained engineer for the party, "Today the Egyptians have laid the foundation for a new life - complete freedom, true democracy and stability".
Hundreds of soldiers and police officers secured the building and Morsi arrived in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Since Mubarak's time, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to congratulate the new president, apart from the president's pomp, traffic was also temporarily blocked so that their motorcade could exit the generally busy road that connects the city center to its southern suburbs.
Morsi's personal standing, mocked as a non-charismatic "empty tire" of the Brotherhood, increased greatly after his victory and his speech on Friday presented him not only as an Islamist but as a candidate for all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 revolution against dictator Mubarak.
Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, took the oath of office before the judges sitting in a wooden panel chamber and said that "Today Egypt is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern nation".
Morsihi then moved to Cairo University, where he was to give his inaugural address.
The military band played the national anthem and received an official welcome while standing in the posture of cautious.
Field Marshal Hussain Tantawi, the military ruler of the Uighurs, was also present.
Upon his arrival, hundreds of people in the lecture hall at the main university there welcomed him with the slogan "The army and the people are one hand".
Founded in 1908 as a stronghold of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took the symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak's dictatorship last year, and swore to the ousted leader last year to withdraw the presidential powers taken from him by the military council.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court rather than the parliament, as is customary, they bowed to the will of the army, which is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatically popular currencies.
You may not be sure, but it's true.
Not only that, but Mission Road has been named after Anjali Kumari, the president of the Nagar Pradesh.
In fact, Jharkhand Development Youth Front has named it to express its displeasure with some of the city's unused streets.
The event was led by the Central Secretary of Jhammo, Satchidanhi Panday.
British police sent Assange a notice of extradition.
British police sent an extradition notice today to Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, who has taken refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and has applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had sent a "notice of surrender" to 40-year-old Australian Assange, for whom he would have to appear at the police station, and that if he failed to do so he would be responsible for his arrest.
Assange is facing extradition in Sweden on charges of sexual offences, and his options under British law expired when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
He had sought asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum, fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the US.
A spokesman for Scotland Yard said that "Ashanje, 40, has sent a surrender notice, requiring him to appear at the police station on a date and time of our choosing".
He is in violation of the terms of his bail.
The embassy declined to comment on the police notification.
Assange fears that because of the release of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the privacy-defying website WikiLeaks, he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to face possible espionage charges.
Officials at the department claim that this is the largest ever TDS theft case.
The group operator of the mall cut the TDS and paid the relevant financial institutions, but did not pay it to the state treasury.
In doing so, he kept the TDS money with him.
The group was targeted by an investigation team from Mumbai on October 17 along with the Jaipur investigation team.
An investigation by the same source revealed that the trader had collected TDS but had not deposited it.
For this reason, the TDS team on Thursday launched an income tax survey on this group.
About 15 days ago, the group of the mall's operator was raided and surveyed.
This businessman has made it clear to the officials of the Income Tax Department that they are not yet willing to pay the TDS to the Income Tax Department.
The Income Tax Department is continually targeting them.
The investigating authorities have clarified that if no payment is made, recovery will be done by sealing the account.
Oil continued to fall to $96 per barrel.
A report showing concern over over-supply on Friday, as well as a report offsetting the increase in power starvation in China, is strengthening.
The benchmark for December delivery was down 14 cents at $96.24 per barrel in late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the American raw New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract has fallen 5.8 percent for the month of October, down 39 cents on Thursday.
The sufficient supply of crude oil has weighed in on the price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. supplies have increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In just over five weeks, supplies have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But a strong demand suggests that the increase in activity has revealed that two reports on Chinese manufacturing have come Friday.
This shows that growth can continue to strengthen China's economic recovery after a decade-long decline in the third quarter of the year, which was 7.8 percent lower than the previous quarter.
Brent Crude, also used by US refiners as a benchmark for international crude oil, dropped 26 cents from $108.58 per barrel on the ICE Exchange in London.
Surrounded by opposition questions at the railway gate, Pawan Bansal put the opposition in a position to protest by saying that he had not looked at anyone's woman in 15 years.
After this, everyone was surprised where the story of the woman came from.
Perhaps Bansal's cue was to the domestic relations of a senior BJP leader and a councillor.
Turning the matter to the other side, Bansal told reporters that the BJP had plotted to compel a woman to complain after him during the last parliamentary election, which was unsuccessful.
In an interview with reporters, Bansal said that the CBI had already questioned him in connection with railway bribery.
If they were called as witnesses in the case, would they be called after a full investigation?
Bhiansal said that in the booth scandal they are talking about, he must have written a letter to only one person in need.
If this is their sin, they will continue to commit such a sin forever.
He said that although the corporation did not have the constitutional right to raise the issue in the House, he himself asked the opposition to speak.
He said that as far as the development works are concerned, the opposition will be given a list of 15 years of development work.
The way Chandigarh is developing or is going to develop, these people cannot even imagine.

Hundreds of devotees attended the occasion.
Lord Hanuman was worshipped on the banks of the Devika on the occasion of Mahavirahi Jayeli.
Advocate Surendra Khazuria, speaking on the occasion, said that a Havan-Yaghi was held on Friday morning at around 8 am, with the worship of Lord Mahavira.
Hawanhi was started at nine o'clock in the morning and completed around noon.
He said that after the Havan Yogha, a huge repository was organized with the help of the city's residents, in which people of every religion of the city took Prasad and received blessings.
Students studying other courses, including technical and management courses running on campus, will be able to exercise their franchise this time.
The Chancellor of the University of Delhi has written to the Governor for permission to hold elections.
As the university's admission process began, there was a demand for student union elections.
To convey his voice to university administration and college management, he also launched a signing campaign to select his representative.
Students enrolled in nearly two dozen courses including campus-based BTech, MBA, Pharmacy, Biotechnology, Bioscience, Tourism Management and Paramedical Science will be able to choose their representative this year.
More than six thousand students studying here will have the opportunity to exercise their franchise for the first time.
Vice Chancellor Professor Ashokhi Kumar said that the university has asked the governor for permission to hold elections.
The date of the election will be announced as soon as permission is obtained.
Electing other colleges is the responsibility of the college management, he said.
Many college managers don't want student union elections on their campus.
At the same time, elections are not held due to a lack of unity among students.
The council had launched a signature campaign for the election.
Aakash Jaiswal, department coordinator of the ABVPhi
After Diwali, the district administration will be asked permission to hold elections in colleges.
The lack of clarity on the college's vision for the student union election is also causing problems.
The entire market was crammed with customers at the Raini Bagh Market.
Recently, people had to wait 15 to 20 minutes to buy pots.
This was the case recently in Wazirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashokhi Vihar Central Market, and Central Market in Pasihan Vihar.
A similar sight was seen at the Saraf shops in Pithamapura, Ashok Vihar, Model Town.
Here too, people bought gold and silver jewels and coins in a flock.
This has also caused the outdoor ring road to be jammed in other markets.
However, people who leave the office to go home have to spend hours in a jam to get home.
Prior to the charges against Jonathan Lord, two YMCA employees were charged with sexual offences, the Royal Commission heard.
Two employees of YMCA NSW have been charged with child sexual offences before Jonathan Lord, a Caringbah child care worker, was indicted in 2011.
But in its statement to the commission, it said that it "never reported a child sexual abuse case within its organization", the commission was told.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the case in which a Y.M.C.A. employee was charged with child pornography offences, and another case in which Y.M.C.A. Caringbah Jim Instructor was charged with child sexual abuse against children in his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare, from the Commission's assistant attorney Gail Fernes, said he knew about the first case, but he didn't know about the second.
He also acknowledged that the statement by YMCA to the Commission that "YMCA has been investigated externally and has found YMCA at the forefront of child protection" is also inaccurate.
The Commission has evidence that YMCA was notified, and it received the second lowest rating out of four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who has been associated with YMCA for 21 years, admitted that the appointment of Lord has caused management "including myself" to fail, and failed to ensure that employees were clearly aware of their obligations to report child protection policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord Co was convicted of sexual offences against 12 children during his two-year stint at the Y.M.C.A.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the suggestion that YMCA had a cultural problem, which led to the employees not reporting a child protection violation by the Lord.
The employees gave evidence of what they saw about the violation, including Lord spending time alone with the children, giving them private babysitting, hugging them, telling them he loves them and letting them play on their mobile phones.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under Lord's supervision and had asked for child safety training because she was concerned about Lord's conduct, testified that YMCA Caringbah's child service manager, Jackie Barnat, who supervised Lord, was "very threatening and hard to find most of the time".
The CEO of HIHI said he did not accept the employees' evidence that they were not comfortable with reporting above their manager.
He said that, rather, his friendship with the Lord had misled his decision to inform him.
Mr. Hare said he had provided his view to the YMCA NSHI W Congregation that the text from "Jonathan Lord's incident" was for the organization "about not giving information".
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have the employees sign the confidentiality agreement immediately after the allegations were made was made by Liam Whitelehi, General Manager of Children's Services at YMCA.
He said that the purpose was to avoid mixing evidence, but that it was not carried out "excessively" and correctly.
Stephen Smallbone, Professor of Child Sexual Abuse at Griffith University, said that the YMCA NSW was not a safe organization when Jonathan Lord was in office between 2099 and 2011.
He said there were "serious problems" with recruiting, tracking, admission, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing has been postponed until December 20.
The silver of ponbrokers is due to the difficulty felt by the middle class in Singapore.
Janani Amirthlinga, in the popshop at the Bendaire Shopping Centre in Singapore, is taking cash by giving her gold ring, ring and zipper to pay her daughter's school fees.
Mrs. Amirathlinga said, "My husband and I recently bought a house, so all our money is stuck in it".
She says that although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (US$2,400) as an administrator, and her husband also has a job, the family's monthly income remains insufficient.
In fact, such demand is present in parts of Southeast Asia - where domestic debt is increasing - and Valumax, where they are trading, became the third ponshop to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Keeping jewelry mortgages is not the only way to get cash - in the case of Ms. Amirithlinga, 1,300 Singapore dollars - but it is almost as cheap as an almost insecure bank loan.
Ponebrokers in Singapore typically charge 17 percent interest per year, slightly higher than the 15.4 percent offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, PONBROKERS have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of pay, and they can provide loans faster than a bank.
Millions of people in the region are turning to ponchos because of the increasing cost of living and the difficulties faced by families due to the increasing domestic and consumer debt.
After five years of strong growth following the global financial crisis, and after cheap credit due to simple monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to ponchos to meet their needs due to the slowdown in their economy.
This week, the rating agency, Standardshi Anje Pours, cited the rising domestic gains, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt ratios in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of this list with 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about the high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged slightly from the tech recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a steady decline in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
Songhi Seng Won, an economist at the Malaysian Bank, CIMB, said, "The crucial point is that with rising prices, people from the middle to lower classes will try to increase their income in every possible way".
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have prompted people to pledge personal property, as they take advantage of the opportunity to value their family's jewelry.
Seventy percent of the items pawned in the 200 pons outlets of City-State in Singapore are gold.
People are saying "Gold looks good, let's let Grandma pawn the gold chain of Mom's, and take it back next month".
The largest pop-shop operator in Thailand, Egemony, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its outlet in recent months.
The mortgage business has grown so much that Valumax, the outlet operator in Bendi-Mire and 15 others like it in Singapore, are planning to expand not only in their neighbourhood, Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, said Valumax's executive director Yah Li Ching.
The company will finance it, using 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it received from listings this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount lenders have been criticized for their high interest rates, Ms. Yah says that pledging not only provides a cheaper rate than other lenders, but also does not directly increase the loan.
"Customers are mortgaging items they already have, and the exploitation of personal assets does not increase household debt", says she.
The social acceptance of ponybroking for short-term and secure financial aid is increasing.
It's not like punhi brokers are only used by financially weak people.
Rich people in Singapore also use the ValueMax outlet, they pledge gold bars or rolex watches which can get up to 60 percent of their purchase price paid in cash.
We have clients from all walks of life.
"These include wealthy individuals who need short-term loans to undertake business or investments, or small businesses who need to meet their cash flow requirements", says Ms. Yahhi.
Sometimes they need money in a very short time.
People have made a lot of purchases of gold and silver in the capital, from pottery to silver.
Such purchases are up 20 to 30 percent from last year.
The jewelry shops in Shimla were crowded with longos.
There was also a large crowd in the pottery shops from the Lower Market to the Malroad.
Although inflation has been on such items this year, people have nevertheless shown no hesitation in shopping on the auspicious holidays.
Good times for shopping on Friday were 7:52 to 10:12 a.m. and 1:56 to 3:37 p.m. and 6:17 to 8:12 p.m.
At the time of the three-hour celebrations, crowds of people in the suburbs, including Shimla, rushed to buy more.
In the Shimla Lower Market, people could not find a place to stand.
The crowd in every small and large store was similar.
In such a situation, when shopping on the Dhanteras, which is celebrated as Krishna Paksha's Trident Dhantryodashi of Kartik month, is a sign of auspicious Diwali.
According to reports, on Wednesday, Veerhi was heading towards an urban willow nursery called Habibullah Malla in Haritar-Sopor.
Suddenly he was attacked by a bear.
He resisted the bear and cried out for help.
By the time people from the vicinity arrived to help him, the bear had badly bruised his face.
The people of the city made a noise, raining stones on the bear.
On this he left Habibullah and hid in a nursery.
The villagers took the wounded Habihibullah to hospital for treatment.
A $325 million rescue package for Tahiji's health
The Union government has stressed that there are also strict conditions attached to a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's failing healthcare system that will ensure that state government funds are not wasted.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent action" to address the current crisis due to the ageing population, high rates of decaying diseases, and systemic limitations.
The decision on funding for the four-year period was made after consultation with the Tasmanian government's independent MP, Andrew Wilkie.
Ms Plibersek said today, "The government has introduced an emergency rescue package, which we believe will address the specific challenges facing the state.
The $325 million package also includes a $31 million alternative surgery plan.
2,600 additional operations, including orthopedic and cataract surgery, will help resolve past cumulative cases.
This includes funding to launch walk-in clinics at Hobart and Launceston, improved post-hospital care, training of medical specialists, mental health services and personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the best practices that leading practitioners have told me to improve Tasmania's healthcare system", Ms Plibersek said.
The minister stressed that the Tasmanian government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The Commonwealth must maintain its current funding level to receive Commonwealth funds, and report monthly on where the additional funds are being spent.
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that services are provided as effectively and efficiently as possible by the state.
Mr Wilkie said that $325 million would not be much until "real reforms are made to bring Tasmania's public health system to a more viable level".
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to their request for immediate assistance, which they first brought to the Prime Minister in early May".
"I hope that the federal assistance package will prove very helpful in separating the state's public health system from the crisis-hit list", Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional alternative procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is "a hi-band-aid solution".
"We're here because the Labor State government has taken $430 million into its health care system", he told ABCTV.
The state government's nearly half a billion dollars in donations and the Commonwealth's $300 million in donations cannot be considered a day of good news.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms. Plibersek should guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The NSA's revelations about state surveillance are fueling corporate fear.
Late on a quiet day in August, a German police helicopter crashed into the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On the instructions of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take a picture of the roof of the US Post Office, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media asked BfV to express hope that it would identify the presence of the listening antenna and signaled an exchange of information between the German Foreign Ministry in the US and Berlin.hi.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, stressed that the U.S. should not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "steal foreign companies' trade secrets and increase American companies' international competitiveness or boost their bottom line" again in September.
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has become a whistleblower, began revealing his secret treasures to US surveillance, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure that the director will keep his word.
The US National Security Agency spotted Brazilian oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, and Yahoo expressed fears about state surveillance.
The last thing came when it was discovered that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly a decade ago.
If Europe's most powerful people can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also potentially targeting.
Snowden has made the deep cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible to use this data for mutual benefit.
"Germany should wake up", says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published in July by German companies Consultinghi believes that the US has almost now become a major risk for industrial espionage and data theft, such as China.
All of the documents leaked by Mr. Snowden, however, have so far been unproven that the United States has known foreign companies' trade secrets to its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern about the EU's lack of internet capabilities and that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are doubting this.
Someone in the German parliament said we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"This is no way", said Hasso Platner, president of German business software company SAPhi.
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, then they wouldn't have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is discounted, from coal to cars to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
Snowden's revelations about US technological sophistication and espionage reach have proved a shock to some companies who previously believed the biggest surveillance threat was China.
A major shift is taking place in the cloud computing space where European authorities are more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore have become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade organization, some 10 percent of non-U.S. members canceled plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after disclosure of the data prism mining program.
Jim Snape, SAP's co-CEO, says: "We saw a new question that customers didn't have a year ago  that is - where is my data stored? and can you guarantee that it will physically remain in that jurisdiction?"
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are simply confirming what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and data and therefore should be guarded at all costs.
That there is economic espionage is not surprising.
This has always happened.
"This has been a topic for many years, and through the fundamental current discussion, nothing has changed", says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical manufacturer BASF.
Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial levels and we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our business.
Corporate leaders are generally not interested in defense systems and this is an advantage for the attacker.
For large companies, it has been a long time since a message was recorded whether it is unwise to leave a home in business with a USB stick, or a laptop without a notebook in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of car manufacturer Audi, says,that it is a mere outdated system of collecting mobile phones before board meetings because they cannot be used as remote listening devices.
Germany's BfV executive advises considering using a simple prepaid mobile when smartphones are compromised due to the risk of overseas trips.
Prepaid mobile phones were then later discarded.
However, small and medium-sized companies are at risk of being hacked and monitored.
In Germany, it is the number one company in the global market in a particular place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access", warns BfV in a report.
The United States has warned against economic espionage of its own companies by other countries.
According to France's The Washington Post, in February, US national intelligence was named after a second-tier of criminals involved in hacking who, along with Russia and Israel, took economic information behind China.
According to a German Blue Chip company board member, when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst.
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French domestic intelligence agency DCRI, explains in an interview that : "The services know well that all countries, even if they support each other in the non-terrorist fight, spy on their allies".
Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial levels and we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our business.
No one made a fool of him.
The training was attended by a significant number of participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazarihibag and Chatara districts.
During the seven-day period, all participants were briefed on various subjects including tent pitching, flagpole.
The training obligation is being fulfilled in collaboration with Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
By joining in the All-Righteous Prayer, all participants are spreading a sense of unity.
Camp head Vipin Kumar, the State Training Commissioner, is providing special assistance.
Rajdhani media member Ajay Rai said that he will be going out there on a smoke-based campaign from November 4.
Bhatti will concentrate on the assembly constituencies of Chhattisgarh, adjacent to Jharkhand.
They are also well aware of these areas.
They will be continuously travelling in Chhattisgarh till 16 November.
There is a strong demand from the Jharkhand leaders in the Chhattisgarh election season.
More than two dozen BJP leaders have already gathered there.
The Congress had also requested the Jamumohi Supreme Shitu Soren and Chief Minister Hemant Soren to campaign in Chhattisgarh in favour of the party, which has been accepted by the top leadership of Jamumo.
Jamhumo has also removed 10 of its previously announced candidates from the polls.
Jamuo has directed the Chhattisgarh State Committee to urge all leaders to join the Congress in the election campaign.
The cry of disappointment from the voters of Obama's constituency.
I voted twice for Obama, hoping for a change.
He says that the policy of blocking GOP has hampered Obama's great efforts.
The Obamacare website's troubles, drone attacks and other disruptive measures cannot be justified by the Obamacare blockade policy.
A memoir of Obama's 2008 campaign reminds us of what might have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading some very sad books these days.
This is a book that I think will encourage me during my second year of medical school and give me a ray of hope.
Its name is "Courage to Win", and it is a reminder of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I get refreshed at night from my patients' prescriptions and go to bed, this book takes me through a period in which politics had inspired millions and speeches could hold your breath.
The elections proved unilateral, and news reporters took a break to highlight the historical significance of the time.
Tears of joy were in the eyes of my classmates, and my parents kept every newspaper they got.
A group of young visionaries were heading to the White House, and the entire country was ready for change.
When Obama became president in 2008, he had an approval rating of 82 percent.
And then I closed the book.
The reality of the present is a harsh truth, like coming back from a dream world.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a distant memory, a sad memory of missed opportunities.
After I first learned how to vote, things really changed.
To put it simply, I couldn't even imagine any of this.
I credit Obama with many accomplishments, from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, to the end of "don't ask don't tell" to the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the policy of non-partisan protest has hindered many of our country's efforts to move forward: including immigration reforms, public options for health care, the closure of the base at Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But the countless times I have defended myself before colleagues and colleagues for the Obama administration - until I run out of answers I can give them.
I have reached a point of political frustration.
The Republican opposition policy is not a response to foreign leaders' espionage, nor is it a response to drone strikes on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond to the National Security Agency's collection of data about the private lives of ordinary American citizens nor to prosecution of people exposing government misconduct.
It cannot explain the cause of the assassination of American citizen Anwar El Awlaki without a trial, nor can it limit the amount of public funds and expenses that are cut during the presidential campaign.
It cannot answer the findings of the report, which says that the White House's attempts to silence the media "have been the most aggressive since the Nixon administration".
And most recently, this, even three years after the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website.
I don't know if this is what I expected.
If, at the age of 18, I had to guess that the ruling system, could reject the political campaign that brought it forward.
It is obvious that elected office is not a predictable path, as opposing political parties and random events such as the Newtown massacre will shape our public debate.
Yet the examples I have given above seem to be largely self-selected by the administration.
This is the thing that most troubles you.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and uncertain alternative, which did not seem to determine his policies or his position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hopes we've been hearing about for a long time.
Yet, while Obama's approval rating is less than 45 percent this week, going back to 2008 through that book has become very difficult.
Seeing him reminds me of his lost promises.
This week I was reading a section of the book that described how Clinton had suffered a huge loss due to Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
At a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinates that they needed to get back on track, and remain true to their goals.
"I want my mojo back", he said.
We should remember who we are.
Five years later today, Mr. President, I cannot agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are those of Nathaniel Morris.
The monitoring group said Syria had destroyed its ability to develop chemical weapons.
The monitoring group said on Thursday that Syria had destroyed critical equipment for the production of chemical weapons and toxic gas war material, while a violent conflict erupted in northern Syria, which is very close to the place where toxic agents are believed to have been kept.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian movement group said that about 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the Syrian civil war, which began almost three years ago.
This announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came a day before the deadline of November 1.
The Hague-based organization had set Damascus up to destroy or "disable" all chemical weapons production units and machinery used to mix chemicals into toxic gases and fill war materials.
The completion of the initial phase of destruction, mainly, is a significant milestone in this ambitious development aimed at destroying all chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer develop new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to destroy the weapons and collections that exist.
It is believed that Syria currently has 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports that the announcement came as the conflict escalated in the town of Safiira on Thursday, which experts believe is the site of a chemical weapons production unit as well as a storage facility.
The movement group, which maintains the death toll through the movement's network in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
She said that 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children, were among them.
The government has said that 29,954 are members of President Bashar Assad's military forces, 18,678 are government-backed fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
It also said that among the dead were 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that about 100,000 people had died in the ongoing conflict since March 2011.
Ishi has not updated the data since then.
As a result of this conflict, some 20 million people have been forced to leave the country.
Assad's military contingent fought rebels in Safiirah for weeks, many of whom were affiliated with al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, the Observatory said that people on both sides had been injured, but it did not say anything explicitly.
This war, which represents the threat faced by chemical weapons inspectors, has a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war in a very short timeframe.
In a statement on behalf of the UN working with the OPCW, it said its team was "now satisfied and confirmed - and has seen all the declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment in Syria - destroyed".
It also said, "No further inspection activity is planned".
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first phase of the confirmation work by visiting 21 of the 23 centres declared by Damascushi.
The inspectors said they were unable to access the two centers for security reasons.
On Friday, the OPCW said that according to Syria, these two centers "have been abandoned and... the chemical weapons products stored there were delivered to other declared centers, which have been inspected".
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safiira was one of the two centres where OPCW inspectors were unable to go.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the OPCW's executive committee next month.
In a statement issued by OPCW, the group's director general, Ahmet Uzumku, said, "I salute the determination and enthusiasm you have shown in completing the most challenging mission this organization has ever undertaken".
This civil war, which has been going on for three years, is mainly a conflict between the Assad government and its security forces, including those who have left Shiite Islam, members of the Alawite sect, and rebel Sunni Muslims.
Among other developments, Rami Abdulrahman, head of the Observatory, said that a powerful explosion occurred on Wednesday at the Air Defense Center in Latakia, a coastal city in Syria.
He added that the cause of the explosion is not yet known.
The Northtel patent case has been filed against Google, Samsung, Huawei.
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed numerous patent lawsuits against cell phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, which it outperformed in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
A consortium called Rockstarhi, which bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, has filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., HTC Corporation, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Googlehi is accused of violating seven patents.
The indictment said that the patents also include technology that combines Internet search terms with words from consistent advertising, which is a key part of Google's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be contacted immediately.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC all make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which is in stark competition with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google had placed an initial bid for the Northtel patents worth $900 million.
Googlehi eventually offered $4.4 billion, increasing the bid several times.
After losing to Rockstar in the Northtel Patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, one of the main reasons being that Motorola has a long list of patents.
The indictment said that "even though Google has lost its bid to acquire patents-in-suit in an auction, it has violated and continues to violate it".
Rockstar has demanded increased compensation against Google, which allegedly claims that Google's patent infringement is gross.
FAA: Airline passengers can now use the gadget in the airplane (but not make calls from a cell phone)
From entering the airplane gate to leaving the gate, passengers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music - but not to talk to their cell phones - under highly anticipated new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
Michael Huarta, FAA administrator, said at a news conference that how quickly these changes are implemented will vary across airlines.
The airlines must show the FAA how their aircraft fulfills the new guidelines, and how they are updating the rules for collecting training manuals and devices for their crew members to show the guidelines.
FAA has said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on board aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
"Depending on the nature of the plan, we may very soon approve the extended use of electronic devices", the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the airport gate is closed.
They are expected to reach an altitude of 10,000 feet and not turn them on until the captain has given permission.
Passengers are expected to turn off their device again when landing, and not turn it on until the plane has landed completely.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are completely protected from electronic interference may allow their passengers to use the device while flying, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airline companies and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use WiFi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these standards.
Laura Gleding, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, has welcomed these changes.
"When the policy is implemented safely - and we will work closely with airlines to do so - it will be a win-win situation for both parties", Gleding said in a statement.
When it comes to this issue, we're bored of feeling like "hall monitors".
But surfing with internet connectivity at altitudes below 10,000 feet, exchanging emails, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data will still be prohibited, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there will still be no conversation with friends, an online game like Scrabble, which is linked to the famous incident in 2011 when actor Alec Baldwin, while staying at the airport park at the gate, was playing on his smartphone, and when he was refused to turn off the device, American Airlines took him off the plane.
We still have to collect heavy equipment such as laptops, etc. as their bouncing will cause concern that another person in the cabin will be injured.
Cell phone calls during the flight will also continue to be prohibited.
The Federal Communications Commission has regulatory authority over phone calls, not the FAHI.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing.
Last month Mark Rosenkant of the National Transportation Safety Board, who is national transportation safety expert for CBShi News, said that cell phones are still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are really serious issues, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigation-related devices, but also because they can interfere with cell phone towers when in the air", said Rosenker.
The industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate the issue last month recommended that the government allow more use of personal electronic devices.
Pressure has been increasing on the FAA in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo, and others have said that there is no legitimate security reason for the ban.
Enforcing these restrictions is becoming even more difficult because the use of the device is widespread.
Some studies also indicate that about a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their device.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 when it received reports of disruptions to navigation and communication equipment caused by passengers carrying FM radio and high-tech gadgets of the time.
While new airlines are more dependent on electrical systems than previous generation aircraft, they have also been designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
HI Airlines has been offering passengers Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes for many years.
Airplanes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
Huarta said that most airlines must meet the eligibility criteria for the increased use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Today's electronic devices emit a much lower power radio transmission than the previous generation of electronic devices.
For example, e-readers, when a page flips, have a transmission of absolutely nominal.
But when the device downloads or sends data, the transmission is predominant.
Amazon.com has been among those who have advocated for easing restrictions on the use of the device by travelers.
In 2011, company officials loaded their entire Kindle e-readers into airlines and blew it up to test problems but found none of them.
The FAHI Advisory Committee has expressed joint feelings about the risks associated with using the device.
Douglas Kidd of the National Aircraft Passenger Association said he believes the disruption from the device is real, regardless of the risk.
Other members of the committee said that there are only reports described by pilots in support of the aircraft system being disrupted by a device, most of which are very old.
However, the committee members recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off the device when the aircraft is landed in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group welcomed the changes and called them a common-sense facility for people traveling in the latest era of technology.
Roger Doe, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, said we are pleased that the FAA has recognized that traveling with pleasure is not incompatible with passenger safety, rescue and security.
Mick Jagger says that when Katy Perry was 18, he didn't hit her.
During an interview with an Australian radio show this week, Phon Star said that he sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry said he had dined with a senior rocker, and when I was 18, he hit me".
"This is outdated, and he treats me well", she said.
A representative of the 70-year-old Jagger said in a statement Thursday that he "clearly denies ever hitting Katy Perry".
The representative also added: "Perhaps Parry is saying about them in the misunderstanding of another person".
Parhieri was one of the singers to appear as a guest on Rolling Stone's tour this year.
Their new album "hi Prism" reached the top spot this week.
Member of the BJP National Executive Committee and chief spokesman Dr. Jitendra Singh said that Pakistan is working on a new policy to infiltrate terrorists under the guise of peace.
Citing reports from intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement on Wednesday that Pakistan is pushing hard to get the nearly 2,000 terrorists prepared to infiltrate its training camps.
For this he will never allow peace on the border.
Pakistan has become even more disillusioned after the separatists' plans to incite the people in Kashmir to wreak havoc have failed.
Citing the visit of separatists to Pakistan last year, the BJP leader said that the ISI chief lieutenant general Zahir ul Islam, the army, the Hezbollah's senior Hafez Saeed and Saeed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism would be tolerated in 2014.
Pakistan is committed to the seriousness of fulfilling this promise.
The killing of soldiers at the border, the Samba, the suicide bombings in Hiranagar are all part of this strategy.
Calling the demand to abolish the privileges of the army in the state in such circumstances lethal, the BJP leader said that it is also anti-people to speak such things until there is lasting peace in the state.
They give an edge to anti-national elements.
He stressed that the leaders' comments that demoralize the army, security forces, should be banned.
Apart from this, MP Badal had heard the difficulties of the people in the villages of Bhagyvandar, Bander Patti, Laleana, Ja'zal, Fullo Khari, Gatwali and Malkana and directed the authorities on the spot to solve them.
MPhi also issued grants for the development of villages.
He ordered the Panchayats to make proper use of the grant for the development of villages, so that the villagers could get facilities.He reviewed the current arrangements for the purchase of rice in the village of Bhagyvandra.
He gave 15 girls who had received training in sewing a sewing machine, plants and certificates.
During this period, 400 Congressmen and PPPs in the village of Bhagyandhra, 35 Congressmen and PPPs in Laleana and 71 families in the village of Jal joined the Shiromani Akali Dal except Congress and PPP.
He said that the Punjab farmers are being insulted in the mandis because of the criteria set by the Centre for the purchase of rice, while the Centre has always been biased towards the Punjab farmer.
He was accompanied by D.C. K.K. Yadav, SSP Ravcharan Singh Barar, ADC de Sonali Giri, ADC Rajiv Parashar, SDM Shruti Sharma, Talwandi Sabo district in charge of the area, Balveer Singh, Sarpanch Kulwant Singh Virk, administrative officers and the leaders of various departments besides the Akali.
A recent media report from Aihi said that the NSA blew up information from Yahoo and Google's data centers for espionage.
The Washington Post has revealed this on the basis of documents gathered from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
The NSA's program, which it ran in conjunction with its British counterpart Part-GCHCQ, was named Muscular.
Both agencies stole data that passed through the massive fiber optic cable network of Yahoo and Google.
The Washington Post quoted a top-secret document dated January 9, 2013, as saying that more than 18 million documents were collected in just three days of the program's inception.
These also include email, text, audio and video messages.
According to the Washington Post, the program was run outside the U.S. and an anonymous telecommunications provider helped NSA gain access to this information.
According to the newspaper, running this program outside the US was much easier for NSAhi, as such campaigns in the US require court orders.
NHI NSA Chief General Keith Alexander denied these allegations during a press conference in Washington, saying-so far as I know, this has never happened.
The NHISA has always collected all information within the scope of the law.
The NHISA was recently targeted for espionage by the German chancellor.
The United Nations said Wednesday that the U.S. administration had assured that its communications system would not be monitored.
The US has also said that the UN's communications system is not monitored.
To fix the seatback, GM recalled pickup trucks in the U.S.
According to a notice issued Friday by U.S. auto safety regulators, General Motors has recalled nearly 19,000 trucks to rectify a shortage in hand-held rotating seatbacks in its brand new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks.
Some trucks may have a deficiency in the front seat rotation system.
As a result, the union failed to comply with auto safety standards regarding seatbacks, head restraints.
According to a notice posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, "if a vehicle is trapped from behind, it is possible that the head restraint will not be able to properly protect the driver, increasing the risk of injury".
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM trucks began shipping in June and, after the 2009 bankruptcy renovation, marks the most significant launch for a top U.S. automaker.
GM had informed truck owners of the defect in late October.
Due to the 16-day government ban on NSTMA, which had hampered the growth of auto sales in October, the owner could not review the notice.
GM said on Friday that sales of Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, increased 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM had sold 42,660 silveradoes and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange were up 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon.

Hi, share your thoughts with us in the comments below.
In Agrahi, a sub-inspector died and four people were seriously injured in a direct collision with a truck and police jeep this morning.
A high-speed police jeep truck was raided near the Torah police station in the Tajikistan area this morning.
In this accident, all the inspectors Registrar Singh died on the spot while four constables were seriously injured.
All of them have been admitted to medical college.
Schools have begun to pay more attention to math, spelling and grammar.
In English literature courses, students must read at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and a contemporary British story from after 1914.
To encourage more reading, the exam will also include "no lessons learned".
A joint English literature and language course will be completed.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to take a separate GCSE in the language, and there will be a lot of motivation to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will release a new curriculum for English and Mathematics tomorrow - both of which will be the first subjects to have a revolutionary change.
It will also change other key themes next year.
In a separate step, the exam will showcase changes in the structure of the GCSE with regulatory off-classes, new grading system, and a reduced course.
Speaking in the heat of the moment, Education Secretary Michael Gove said that "there was a great deal of consensus that, in order to restore people's confidence, we need to improve our own examination system", adding that the GCSE would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies have found that English schools devote less time to math - 116 hours a year or - less than 3 hours a week during the session in most countries.
Australian schools provide students with an average of 143 hours per year, compared to an average of 138 hours in Singapore, according to a comparison.
While there will be no formal need to give more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that the combination of comprehensive mathematics with the subjects in the GCSE - league table for more weight was likely to encourage additional teaching in schools.
This course will focus more on "real-world problems", including financial mathematics.
From controversy over seat width to big orders from jet manufacturers to betting on.hi
A race to set the pace for fights for this month's Dubai Airshow has begun among leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long-haul flights.
Controversy centers on the width of economy class seats on long-haul aircraft, not always as given by airlines but whose allocated location efficiency has been claimed by the latest Jet Airways SAS and Boeing Company to be key.
Airbus hopes to set an industry standard by giving at least 18 inches (46 cm) of seating in the economy cabin this week, but that should be decided by the airline, its main competitor Boeing says.
The dispute between aircraft manufacturers comes when a race to sell a larger version of the twin engine of the long-haul aircraft was launched from a possible order placed after the 17-21 incident.
How is the aircraft's front compartment designed - especially whether the seating is equal to 9 or 10 - while designing mini jumbo jets are being designed with the claims of greater capacity in mind?
Boeing says it has built a "777 X" that will hold 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 logos in a row in the eponymous department.
Airbus says that competing with the A350, it will take 350 people to a seating capacity of 18 inches and 9 inches.
Airline giants often trade on technical matters through advertising in the business press.
Now, the Airbus 777 X is expected to dominate over 100 orders at the Dubai Airshow in May, making further appeals to the public.
Recently it has been seen that the beginning of the Whig War was something else, showing Finansero that together in a restaurant all three together.
John Leahy, head of Airbus sales, said: "Boeing is offering long-haul flights in short-seats even from regional turbochargers".
As a change, people may be getting bigger, but the way planes sit hasn't changed.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, between the 1970s when the Boeing 747 was introduced and the century when the average American male aged 40-49 years increased his weight by 10 percent.
According to U.S. health statistics, the average American male in the 21st century has a waistline of 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its rivals are stuck with the 1950s one-seat concept when the new name "Jethi Set" was a medium-circuit hybrid.
Airbus says it has set up a research commission that suggests an extra inch in seat width to improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing has disputed Airbus's seat measurement data, saying it is not up to the manufacturers to decide how the airline balances rents and amenities.
It is also said that research shows that the width of a seat depends more on the experience of the cabin than on the width of a seat.
Kent Craver, a Boeing cabin expert, said: "It really explains what airlines need to do to be successful in providing flexibility and in putting their trust in things".
"They don't want to tell us what they benefit from".
They know their business better than anyone else.
For flyers, it's about the elbow room, but for suppliers, it's increasingly an issue that it could affect revenue.
The trade behind this dispute is estimated to be worth at least $700 billion, and competition for aircraft orders is sufficient to tip the scales of American and European exports in the coming decades.
A report by Reuters reported that for the first time in July,whether the seat layout is actually a battle issue between new jets was discussed.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that they have a 20 percent efficiency per seat in their new twin engine design of that segment's leader, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300R.
Boeing's claim to performance depends on the 777 X One with 10 compared to the original 777 design with 9 with 777.
The comparison of the unit cost with the profit equal to 10 is now used.
Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus passenger facilities in Europe, says "Boeing is doing this to make their aircraft more competitive with our products, to occupy more seats".
On the other hand, analysts say the entire 10-seat-per-line cabin suggests for the existing 777 S that many passengers are in favor of a densaur layout, which can be accompanied by a cheaper rental.
Cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network, said" An eighteen-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that this business point of Airbus is powered by the threat of Proposition 777".
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list of suppliers for airlines to choose from.
Even jet vendors around the world should take careful measures to check out this layout competition.
While more relaxed, all builders are also offering low-cost jet flights and high-density layouts for regional travel.
Airbus is offering a 10 equivalent A350 but says it is not yet sold.
But until recently, Airbus had emphasized the need for more cabin facilities on some of its jets.
It is unlikely that modern jet aircraft will fly to a new industry standard without the support of another manufacturer, but it could distract from the 777 X sales wave.

Premature puberty: early adulthood
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty at a younger age than their age group, white girls.
Physical change does not mean that puberty is near.
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemical can be blamed.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the causes of puberty in younger age.
Premature puberty is not as effective in boys.
Pat Etheridge, a former CNN correspondent, is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter begins to develop breasts and genital hair at the age of seven or eight?
This week at the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitz explained that these early physical changes are common in American girls, represent a new trend.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents that - in general - this does not reflect rapid progress toward full puberty", says Kaplovitz.
Direct symptoms of development such as the onset of breast, genital and forehead hair, and physical odor are showing early in girls.
But in the last four decades there has been a very slight change in the age of Rājodhārṇa (first menstrual-religion).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, up from 12.75 in 1970.
"When breasts begin to develop, the first period takes at least two to three years", explains Caplovitz, who is also the author of "Premature puberty in girls: a necessary guide to dealing with this common problem".
The most accurate test of puberty is the time.
There is debate about what is the beginning of puberty, but when breast growth increases with two before the age of 8, it is called "child-adult".
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop - which can be closely monitored by pediatricians.
If more rapid progress is made, an endocrinologist may need to examine to rule out the possibility of serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay premature menstruation and other consequences: premature ageing of bones, which can lead to undeveloped growth and nausea as an adult.
Recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on the age of the child, the rate of growth, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is aware of drugs but admits, "repressing youth can increase behavioral issues, and girls can start to feel different from their peers".
Another big problem can be understood: parents simply don't want their young daughter to have a menstrual period.
"They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain hygiene", Caplovitz said.
A woman whose daughter started menstruating at the age of 10 recalls, "It was a shock.
Although there were signs of this and we also talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She returned home scared of her school and upset that her friends had first started menstruating.
There are many well-established theories about the causes of premature puberty.
Yet, there is no consistent evidence that milk or other food products can be blamed for hormones, chemicals in the environment, or homosexual messages in the media.
Boys too - like girls - are reaching premature puberty.
Caplovitz's rule states that the main cause is an outbreak of constipation.
He helped to conduct a study in 2001 on girls aged 6 to 9, which linked body fat to the period of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty before their age.
There are many explanations for this.
Globally, the model of premature puberty, from economic conditions to weather and genes, seems to be affected by everything.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting facial and genital hair at an early age, the full-blown trend of puberty is not as clear in them as in girls.
Other practitioners attending the AHI conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it has become common to see hair on the mucous membranes and genitals.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the real onset of puberty", says Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goraib Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their pediatrician on how to talk to their children to get an opinion.
"This may mean negotiating ahead of schedule", advised Kaplovitz.
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond correctly.
Premature-developing girls need to be reassured that even if it is happening prematurely, it is still part of normal life.
Ajaz Jan, MLA from Punch assembly constituency, inaugurated the water cooler at the Gurudwara campus.
The lawmaker said that a considerable number of people go and go to Gurudwara, but the water cooler has been installed because there is no proper provision of drinking water here.
This will allow people to get cold water during the summer days.
In the winter season, pure plain water will be available.
This will eliminate the problem of drinking water for pilgrims visiting the temple.
The occasion was attended by members of the Gurdwara committee as well as others.
Israeli fighter jets raided Syria, officials said.
Israeli fighter jets targeted the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administrative official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not say what the purpose was, but there must have been at least one purpose.
A report by the Associated Press reports that the target was the Russian SA-125 missile.
Israel has already air-strikes on missiles inside Syria at least twice this year.
From then on he continued to commit adultery.
Not only that, but she was taken to hospital for an abortion, fearing she would become pregnant.
Later, he called home and even tried to poison her.
When the relatives of the minor proposed marriage to the young man, the young man's relatives beat him up.
Police have filed a lawsuit against the young man, his brother and parents.
According to the minor, three years ago, a Malital resident met with his son Ramesh, a proud man.
After that, she whispered and called home and had sexual intercourse.
After that, he continued to commit indecent acts by threatening.
On October 18, he took the teenage girl away.
On 21 July, he gave her poison in exchange for medicine, with the intention of killing her.
The young woman's condition worsened and she was taken to the BD Pandey Hospital for treatment.
Meanwhile, relatives tried to marry her but she refused.
Not only that, but the brother of the accused, Anandhi, was also beaten on Degree College Road.
Kothiwal BD Jual informed that on the basis of the allegations, a case has been filed against the youth Gurav, his brother Anand, mother Kunti and father Prakash under sections 376, 323, 506.
The investigation of the case has been entrusted to S.I. Rajendra Kumar.
Tripodes deny being influenced by the Obide.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the State Corruption Watch Dog.
Former NSW Labor Minister Joe Tripodi has refused to deny the policy of sea leases at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obide, former New South Wales patron Eddie Obide, who had hidden interests in three government-controlled lands.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday detailed the investigation into whether Mr. O'Brien lobbied several state ministers for violations of lease policy circulars, where two restaurants and cafes owned by Mr. O'Brien were renewed without tender after their deadline expired in August 2005.
The allegation that Mr Tripody knew Mr Obid's hidden interests is now being investigated after evidence provided by former Deputy Chief of Staff Linhi Ashpole on Thursday.
In 2005, during years of discussions, the government had pressured for the launch of public tenders for leases.
The tenants were against it and wanted more time.
In 2009, the Enterprise Circular for Leases, from which Obid earned $2.5 million a year, was renewed without leases.
Mr Tripathi, who was the minister of Dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, initially supported the public tender.
But he refused to change at Mr. Ohibayd's request, Mr. Tripodi had urged a change in government lease policy.
A transcript submitted to a telephone call by ICAC in May and September 2007 by Mr. O'Boied and Mr. Tripody and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to Mr. O'Boied's fisheries department after working for the Ministry of Ports.
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi, "Were commercial lease policy development discussed in the telephone conversation, the matter of the matter?"
"No", Mr. Tripodi answered.
Hi, I can't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. O'Brien.

According to police, she died from drowning.
Unfortunately, his friend has been detained by the police on charges of hiding the deceased's belongings from him.
Police have submitted the final report of the investigation into the death to the court.
It is known that on August 26, police had recovered the body of Zaheed Iqbal, a resident of the Padashadi garden in Jhelum Dria.
Even his friends were accused of killing him by his relatives because his mobile phone and other belongings were missing.
In the report, police said that the deceased's phone and SIM were examined and found that his phone was being used by a woman in Saura.
The woman said during the interrogation that she had received the phone from a relative of hers, Rachel Gauhar.
Ruahel also lives in the pastoral garden and was a friend of the late Zahied.
Ruhal had taken a bath in Jhelum with Jahied after the namaz-e-jumma on August 25.
Zahid unwrapped his clothes and laid all his belongings on the bank, while Rahel went to the other side to smoke.
When he returned, Jahied was not there, only his clothes.
Ruihel searched for Jahied, but he could not find him.
On this he picked up his mobile phone, watch and other belongings and kept them for his own use.
He did not tell anyone that Jahied had drowned.
Police told the court that the death of Zahihi was from drowning and was confirmed in the post-mortem.
However, Rahel has been detained under Section 404 for hiding the facts and belongings of the deceased.

In the morning, people were also seen enjoying the sunshine.
The weather changes will also provide significant relief from frostbite, but after that, the day-long cloud shadow continued to sustain the series of sunshades.
Even the children wore sweaters to their school.
Meanwhile, the Air Force Weather Department said the maximum temperature on Wednesday was 25.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature was 13.7 degrees Celsius.
While 7.8 millimeters of rain was recorded.
According to the Meteorological Department, cloud cover will continue to be visible in the sky.
The outcry over the conviction of the man who plotted the bombing in Balihi
The relatives and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 bombings, expressing outrage at the punishment of the planner, said that Omar Patek should face the firing squad.
Patek, who had been on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted fugitives for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building the explosive device used in the bombing.
If given parole, he could be released in 15 years.
45-year-old Omar Kohi was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injuring many more.
He was also found guilty of many other terrorism-related charges, including the 2000 series of bombings of a church in Indonesia on Christmas Eve.
Prosecutors had demanded a life sentence, although they could also demand that the man, known as the master bomb maker, the notorious "destructor", be given the death penalty.
This decision has refreshed the painful memories of June Curtain, a Perth woman who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and his accomplices a decade ago.
Stopping his ashuhi, he said that Patek should have been executed.
I really feel that he should have been punished just like other Khunkarhi terrorists.
"He should be put in front of the firing squad", Ms. Courtin told AAP.
I have to live without my grandchildren and my daughters every day.
The club's name was dropped shortly after 11pm on 12 October 2002, after a bomb exploded in a van outside the Sari club.
Peter Hughes, who was in the paddies bar when a bagpack full of explosives was detonated by suicide bombers exactly 20 seconds before.
They went into a month-long coma as a result of the bombing and "died" three times while on life-saving devices.
Mr Hughes says that Patek should have received the same sentence as three other members of the terrorist group responsible for the massacre - Amarogi, Mukhalas and Imam Seera - who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be executed before anyone else.
Keeping her alive, look, there's no reason to keep her alive.
After killing 202 people and injuring countless others, getting a 20-year sentence is not enough.
Pattiek, the last person to be convicted of the Bali bombers.
He evaded capture for nearly a decade, but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the U.S. military killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent had provided evidence that the report revealed Patek was in Pakistan to meet Bill LaDaN in an attempt to re-establish contact between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He did not surrender", says Ms. Courtin.
Even today, it is not really sad to cause so many people mental anguish.
The decision came ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year", said Ms. Courtin.
Patekhi can still appeal against his sentence.
Hotel staff protested and began beating.
The son of a drunk MP started a fight with RK Singh, the younger brother of the hotel owner who came to the rescue.
Meanwhile, many more people came there.
He tried to catch the young man who was beating him, but he fired a rifle.
The shooting sparked a sensation in the area.
At this point, hotel staff arrested him and called the police.
Hotel owner Munna Singh, who arrived at the Badohi station, filed a report against Anand Pandey, son of Gorakhnath Pandey, a Berwa Baharpur MP from Koirana Station in Badohi district.
At which point the police seized the rifle while arresting her, Anand.
According to Indian Indian Inspector Ashok Saraswat, the fat man from Pratapgarh, Munna Singh runs a hotel called Rag Darbar on the National Highway.
At about eight o'clock at night, Anand Pandey arrived at the hotel and ordered a meal.
When the cooking was delayed, she began to gossip, beat and fire.
Anandhi was drunk and threatened to kill hotel staff.
The inspector of the hotel says that the hotel is near the village of Bhiti and is adjacent to the district of Badohi.
Mr. Bighi was jailed for secretly informing a cocaine addict lawyer about a police investigation.
Basharat Dutta, 42, reported to the notorious criminal Neil Scarborough.
The lawyer thought that people could find out about his secret drug addiction.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
The defense's top lawyer, who informed Mr. Big of the main police investigation, because he feared people would find out about his secret drug addiction, has been sentenced to three years in prison.
After Barasht Ditta, 42, settled for cocaine, he provided the notorious criminal Neil Scarborough with sensitive confidential information about his drug trafficking activities.
This lawyer, nicknamed "Bash", and hailed as a "top brief" by criminals, was arrested in 2011 from his home in Scarborough after a police surveillance operation, which he had represented in the previous narcotics trial.
Scarborough, 32, was seen by authorities holding three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out for a Law Society dinner with his colleagues.
After finding cocaine particles in Ditta's hair, wallet, and credit card, an investigation revealed that Ditta was a "regular user" of class A drugs.
During an eight-month period between January and August 2011, she attempted to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two people by Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were being monitored by police at the time as part of the main investigation into heroin and cocaine gangs operating in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Among them were 32 other individuals who were jailed by the police after seizing heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds and more than 200,000 pounds of cash during several raids.
Ditta, 42, was a former informant for criminals, fearing that her cocaine addiction would not be disclosed.
Ditta, who works for the position law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was facing a failure at Liverpool Crown Court today after being found guilty of two counts of obstruction of justice following a three-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.
He had admitted to possession of cocaine at a previous hearing.
The lawyer's bad time began when investigating Scarborough, police discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta since February 2011.
Two detectives chased the suspect and saw him coming to Ditta's house and holding drugs with a purity of more than 60 percent under the barrister's bench in the Black Golf Glove.
After the drug was administered, Scarborohi was in regular telephone contact with Ditta, who had gone out for dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium, Ewood Park.
When the lawyer arrived at the house, he discovered that drugs were stored there and that they had had nine conversations.
The court heard that after evidence of a class A drug was found on Ditta's hair, wallet and credit cards, the trial found her to be a "regular user" of cocaine.
Dhietta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use and said he was talking to the suspect dealer, as he was his client, and said that their discussion was a matter of "legal privilege".
During her arrest, Dittahi tried to remove many credit cards by taking out her wallet, but they were seized, and her hair sampled.
In a police interview, he said that he ran an office from his workplace as well as his home, and that his clients called his home for legal matters.
After the principal persons arrested revealed what the detective knew about them, the court heard that Dittahi called the heads of the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously filed a case.
"A criminal lawyer should know best about not breaking the law", said Anne White, a prosecutor for the prosecution.
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, of being too close to his particular client.
We are not talking about a relationship with a common drug dealer, but rather a dealer who is supplying drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly have been legal, without a doubt, since he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his limitations of lawyer-client relations.
He disrupted the police investigation as much as possible so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was not respecting his profession, but insulting.
She had made very close contacts with certain clients, especially Scarborough, and she allowed herself to settle.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said: "The moment Mr Ditta started receiving drugs from organized criminals, he transformed himself from criminal lawyer to criminal".
Because of his cocaine addiction, he became highly compromised and became much more vulnerable to the aims of leading members of organized crime groups, who used it to obtain important information related to police investigations.
Advocates should maintain the highest standard of honesty, and should fill people with confidence and confidence.
Mr. Ditta has deceived this belief and has tried to escape in the guise of his profession.
The Lancashire Unit for Serious and Organised Crime investigated Mr Ditta, who was also found guilty of three counts of possession of cocaine and now obstructing justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bringing the perpetrators to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to offenders that no one is far from the reach of the law.
We will search you and bring you to court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Thirty-five other gang members were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug offences.
On her website, Ditta posted a question-and-answer session about herself, in which she said that her fantasy job would be to be an attorney for a client facing the death penalty in the US, to have Muhammad Ali as her dinner guest and to have inequality as the inspiration for her work.
Bombardier's profits as a result of aircraft deliveries declined, orders fell.
Canadian aircraft and train maker Bombardier Inchi reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, as pressure from aircraft orders and deliveries on its train unit in the third quarter and contractual issues was less.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or issue an update on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious schedule of entering commercial service from September next.
About a month and a half after the test aircraft's first flight, it has been flown just three times, raising the question of whether the test phase is on track.
The result fell below forecast and shares have been sent to a sliding of more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its rating from "matter" to "sector performance" for the stock, which is up over the next one or two quarters.
"While weaker aircraft deliveries were largely expected, we are clearly disappointed with margin performance in transportation", Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive a new order for the Bombardier CShieries as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, it is doubtful that the market will be suspicious of the program.
Bombardier hopes the aircraft family can now cut it off at the lower end of the market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
Potential buyers are waiting for the flight test results to validate the company's claims about the new jetliner's fuel efficiency and potential cost savings, but as for CShieries, the firm orders are as low as 177.
With 15 customers and operators, 403hi is available for complete ordering and commitment.
CEO Pierre Boudoin believed Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet was put into commercial use.
Officials assured analysts and media on Thursday that the event was going according to schedule.
"The test aircraft was on the ground longer than expected", Bowdoin said in a conference call, adding that it was also scheduled during the aircraft's ground test and software update intervals.
Each manufacturer creates a schedule differently.
We decided to make a first flight and have an updated period and said what we have done.
This is why everything will be done through the flight program.
The second remaining portion of the five test planes, with the following shortly after, is expected to take off in the coming weeks, the company said.
Still, analysts believe customers are suspicious of the possibility of a CSeries aircraft operating after their first flight in the first 12 months.
Bombardier has said it has evaluated the schedule of services in the entrance (EIS) and will provide an update over the next few months.
"This slow flight test - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - confirms our view that service at the entrance will be pushed to Q1/15", Dorssen said.
For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue plunged from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, analysts expected to earn 10 cents per share and revenues of $4.56 billion.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said that 45 aircraft were delivered during the quarter, down from 57 a year ago.
The net order fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion on September 30, with no change from December 31.
"Heavy aerospace, the results were in line with our guidance, but the low-order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment", Bowdoin said.
Hi, aerospace revenue fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombhiardier said that the world's largest train manufacturer, the division, had grown revenues by about 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Orders in the transportation unit were backlogging at approximately $32.6 billion as of September 30, up slightly from December 31.
Even some major contracts on the margins of the Transportation Division were affected by issues of execution.
The executive officials said that new guidance will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier shares, which Google Inc. chief financial officer Patrick Pichet announced the addition of board, were down 8.5 percent at C$4.83 even in midday trading on Thursday.
Embraer SA of Brazil, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Parents of intersex children can choose their children's gender indefinite.
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to recognize the third gender for children born with vaginal genitalia.
From now on, newborns will not be identified as male or female in a more conservative manner.
Under the new law, parents are not required to declare gender for such children, this law allows them to declare gender hi non-determined" or "non-determined" on the child's birth certificate.
The new law aims to reduce pressure on parents who can make hasty decisions about gender-specific surgery for newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex children.
According to the BBC, an intersex person said years later, "I am neither male nor female".
I will continue to be a wounded, stained by doctors.
It is estimated that every year one in 2,000 children is born a boy or a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that come under the scope of the examination of sexual developmental disorders, a collective term used for an abnormal chromosome, genital tract (ovarium or testicle), or an abnormally developed sex.
It may be that Wallis Simpson was intersex.
Gender identification is still not fully understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when gender determination cannot be done, it is best to use the best available information to determine gender and, if such a development occurs, to monitor the child's psychological and physical development before undergoing surgery.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychologist in New York City who specializes in gender identity issues, said that Germany's new law "seems like a good thing".
Intersex children create moral discord.
"Some people are in a life-threatening situation that requires surgery, but this is not the case with most children", he said.
You can specify the sex without surgery, and then see how the identity develops.
The science of knowing how a sex will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No one can give a valid answer as to why this happens.
It's a kind of puzzle as to why people are gay.
In a report filed with the European Commission in 2011, intersex people are described differently from transsexual or transgender people, as their status is not related to gender but to its biological makeup, which is neither clearly male nor female but either a combination of both or neither is clearly defined.
These traits may themselves exhibit secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breasts and length; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals; or in chromosomal structure and hormones.
This report provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender individuals in the field of employment, as well as harassment, violence and biased crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-compliant sex.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to mark men, women or "third gender" on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Wilby became the first person in the world to be recognized as "genderless" after winning a legal appeal for life-long "unspecified" gender status.
According to the Ministry of Interior, in addition to M or F, the German passport will also have a third specification as X for intersex persons.
According to a news report on France 24, gender issues in neighboring France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country signed a petition to withdraw "gender theory" from school books.
The U.S. Catholic Online website has also opposed this German law, saying, "While the world is going to a state where gender is a choice of choice, not sexual activity, we are taking two more pillars of civilization in the opposite direction".
The mother of a newborn in Maryland also told Baby Joan that she would love to see babies given a gender at birth.
"Raising children without additional limits is very stressful, especially if you don't even know what your child's gender is", he said on his website about parenting.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphroditic (bisexual), after the beautiful Greek goddess who was bisexual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered Linghi to be a slate that could be erased and then written down.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, realizing that gender recognition is a complex task, and sometimes even doctors can make mistakes, who don't know how children will feel about their gender specification when they grow up.
"In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called a'mental emergency,'" Dr. Drasher says.
When these babies were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The current theory about the treatment of children with vaginal genitalia was proposed by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was valid.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues - how parents raise a child - by interacting with the child's genes and hormones determine whether he or she is identified as male or female.
But in a case in 1966, known as "John/Hioan", his theories became controversial.
They advised the parents of a child whose penis had accidentally lost its sex during a surgical procedure to remove the child's ovaries by completely binding it and making it look like a baby girl.
"Money presented that case as a successful case of transition, but that didn't happen", Drasher said.
At the age of 15, the child transformed himself back into a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dr. Drecher said that some doctors are still "following the same model".
But with the advent of the Internet in the years after 1990, individuals who underwent these gender operations began to emerge "not happy with the result".
A similar case was with 36-year-old Montana author Jim Bruce, who was born with the XYH male chromosome, but had vague genome.
The doctors clearly did not understand whether her penis was small, or her scalp was large, but they were sure that she could never live a "satisfied life" as a man.
So shortly after her birth in 1976, Bruce's outer organs and ovaries were removed by surgery and she was raised like a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl", she told ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was very difficult to question.
At the age of 18, she was about to undergo a vaginoplasty.
But feeling depressed and somewhat confused, she demanded medical records.
But this revealed to him the terrible truth.
I was taken into custody at birth - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone, causing his genitals to not develop properly.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, took a testosterone supplement and removed his breasts.
She became sterile due to surgery.
Today, he works at an organization called Interface Projecthi, where he persuades people to normalize their perceptions of intersex individuals.
But Anne Tamer-Matis, the managing director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, expresses concern that German law "invites gossip and slander".
"Many activists believe that German law will prompt parents to make quick decisions and to specify the child as 'undetermined,'" says Vehi.
We fear that this will encourage interference.
We think that it is a better process to specify the gender of the male or female, rather than waiting.
But we do not know how the law will play its part, so we can only speculate.
Tamer-Matisse said his organization supports Australian law because "it allows adults to be identified as third-gender".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about multiple sexes", he said.
German law concerns specifying the time of birth.
This is not the kind of fighting that newborns are fighting at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their bodies.
But Pittsburgh-based breast radiologist Dr. Erlin Baratz, whose daughter has a developmental disorder, and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that German law would "empower both parents and children".
Bharatji's daughter Katy was born with male chromosomes, but she had a complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (DSD).
Since her androgen graphite was defective, female attributes developed in Katy.
Her body has a vaginal opening but not a uterus or ovaries.
Now 29, Kathihi is married and a resident in the Department of Pediatric Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to become a mother through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"This law allows parents to avoid rushing to make any decisions on their own", said Bharatz.
This gives them time to understand and understand them properly by some tests before writing male or female.
In this way, you are well - raise the child, love the child.
You have a cute baby and enjoy it.
We don't need to rush into an operation that can't be repaid.
"This brings children into the decision-making process and frees parents from the suspicion that motivates them to do so because they don't believe they are doing well", he said.
Eventually, the child will determine which sex he is more comfortable with - and that would be a very good thing.
This enables children to make their own decisions.
Beautiful expression was presented in line with the plot of 'Another Dronacharya' which shows harmony in the Dvahapur era and present circumstances.
The show showed how in today's context a guru is bound to the wrong path by being bound in what chains.
The play was launched in the hall of St. Joseph Inter College by the chief guest MLA Prabhupadalal Walmikhi, the deputy chairman of the camp council Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh.
The play showed the similarity of the circumstances of Dronacharya of the Dwaper era and a present-day professor Arvindhi.
In the drama directed by Anil Sharma, Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Bechain, Hemant Goyal, सीमा Samar, Vanshidhara Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun etc. performed brilliantly, giving full justice to the characters.
The lighting in the play was provided by young colourist Jitendra C. Raj and the set was designed by Hemanthi Kumar.
The ceremony followed with the awarding of various awards by the APPTA to distinguished individuals who have made literary and cultural contributions.
It was given to Dr. Aslam Jamshedpuri, chairman of the Urdu department of Charan Singh Vivhi, senior journalist Shanbhunanath Shukla and colourist Jitendra C. Raj.
Among the executive officials in the organisation of the event were Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi, etc.
Clive Palmer claimed that there is a conflict of interest between PM Tony Abbott and the paternal holiday scheme.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer has said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott's interest in the paternity leave scheme is a conflict of interest as his daughters may become pregnant, and may benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in dispute over the payment of the $6 million carbon tax bill, has claimed, while he has tried to answer questions about the conflict.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which can be crucial in determining whether to reduce carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only ministers' interests can be in conflict, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters can personally benefit from the policies.
"In the case of paternity leave, they may have a significant conflict of interest, because if any of their daughters become pregnant, they will have a direct interest whether or not they get a leave", Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr Palmer the winner of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes after falling again.
Mr. Palmer called for a revival of the election count to speed up the process.
Tony Aot's daughters are Frances and Bridget.
Should the election result come two months after we vote?
"We should have a better system", he said.
Why can't we have a system in which we fill our votes on the computer, vote immediately, and at 6:30 p.m. we have the results.
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
Is it because if a person doesn't like him, the other person can delete him?
Using a pencil seems completely nonsensical in today's world.
The Election Commission is studying options for electronic voting, and recently issued a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his policies include building an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and he took his new job "very seriously".
Public office is for public service.
"We need no other award than the award of history that we can serve the community at this critical time", he said.
George Kerrivan: The breakdown of the euro gave the Scots a choice.
Another day, another story of freedom fear.
This time we have been warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join as an independent travel zone across Europe as a condition of EU membership.
Passport control at Barhivik and stories about the boundary of the wire wire on Hadrian's walls suggest stories of the curved wire.
It is true that the Strathclyde paper described the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although - predictably - it was not described in the headlines.
Neither did anyone explain that EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules as they see fit.
Since Scotland is no longer a Schengen area, Brussels would be discounted to Brussels for a sustained non-compliance in exchange for getting what it really wants from Scotland.
So, then, ah-ha-ha-ha.
The first time I heard the baseless news about "freedom means passport control" was about 40 years ago.
Yet an interesting point was lost in retelling this interesting old story.
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to bid for Europe anyway?
Why should the York of London be bought and sold for Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: the great, post-war plan to organize Europe has finally come to a halt.
With the Euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Parties throughout the EU are gaining strength, either in opposition to the EU or in opposition to the closure of the euro as a single currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptical Alternative for Germany party - which was founded this year - suddenly came along and won almost half a million votes in the federal election in September, effectively excluding the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own Lib Dems) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to build a federal Europe.
But the current economic crisis has proved to be a turning point.
With the strict rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, as well as the obstacles imposed on national economies through the adherence to the same currency, many people are thinking that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis did not play a very large role in the excessive budget deficit of national governments - this was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system stabilized the exchange rate of its members in favour of German exporters - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the domestic currency, Southern Europe finds itself in a position with inherent productivity losses compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce wages and public spending - which Berlin has encouraged.
Far beyond current budget and currency problems, there is a deep European productivity sickness.
To give French and German energy companies a discount on consumer spending - as a result of the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels, European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United Nations.
This is a crippling cost loss, which we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Even if all wages in the world were frozen, the European petrochemical industry could not be prevented from being affected by cheap U.S. shale gas.
As a result, there is a sense of rebellion among the people, especially in France, which was once a major fan of the EU.
After the war, top French politicians saw the EU as a means of keeping Germany in control, and Paris as a means of providing the world with billing equal to Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, causing France's economy to shake.
Results: The right-wing National Front, which is opposed to the EU and is under the leadership of Marine Lee Payne, has won the recent by-election, pushing the ruling Socialist Party to third place.
At the moment the Front is the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - it is a timely warning to British Labour that they cannot go on assuming that disintegration for the left, self-benefit for the right will be a great deal.
What is Lee Payne doing with his newfound fame among the white French, working class?
The party wants to use the EU elections next year to create an anti-EU, all-out anti-money faction in the European Parliament.
If, as is quite possible, the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections, this kind of faction could for the first time influence the European Parliament.
My view is this: soon a fusion of anti-EU and anti-monetary sentiment in Europe will bring the euro to an end.
The euro will not be completely eliminated, but it will return to a form like "Europe of sovereign nations" supported by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its successor economies may maintain the euro, but France and southern Europe will resume their currencies.
I expect the UK to keep itself away from this project in the hope of increasing its proximity to the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after this?
We may choose to remain (as necessary) a territory of Little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to secede at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better in a loose European system, provided we keep our own currency.
This will make it easier for non-federal nations to work together with other like-minded countries in Europe.
Otherwise we should consider maintaining our economic independence while following the path of Norway.
The SNP government in Scotland has - remarkably - been the most successful anti-friendliness political campaign in Europe, having won a staggering majority in 2011 against the cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour's Chancellor Alistair Darling and subsequently the Tory-Lib Dem Alliance.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, as it would have to accept the rules of friendliness imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
So you thought travel agents were from the last century, thank you for the internet?
The Flight Center of Ahi is promoting this trend.
The company has increased its full-year profit forecast, and expects record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
This travel company expects its pre-tax profit to be between $325 million and $340 million for the full year, compared with a previous forecast that it was between $305 million and $315 million.
If the target is achieved according to current guidance, this will increase the record profit of $290.4 million achieved in 2011/12 by 12 to 17 percent.
HI Managing Director Graham Turner said that Flight Center made a profit of 8 percent in the first half, and made a good start in its second half, particularly in non-business travel in Australia and the UK.
"So far, our 10 countries are profitable, and many countries are on track to record full-year earnings before interest and tax contributions", he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally our most profitable centres.
In Australia, the holiday business has picked up momentum in the second half, filling the slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market shortage.
Similarly, in the UK, the leisure business of Flight Center performed well, while corporate clients were spending less.
U.S. business, which was seasonally weak, had already made up for its losses in its first half, and is expected to make a profit for the third full year in a row.
Flight Center's shares were up $38.20 yesterday with a 3 cent increase.
To protect the bird from the North Sea rig, the air transportation left the bird back in the woods.
The bird found nestled on the North Sea Oil Rig has been released by air transportation back into the wild from the coast.
This water rail was sent to Aberdeen by helicopter before being resuscitated by the Scottish SPCA at their rescue centre in Aloa.
Colin Sedden, the Centre Manager at the Centre for Water Management, said: "This waterway was probably a wintering migratory bird from Northern Europe, which was caught by strong winds over the North Sea".
It seems that this bird was tired and took refuge in the oil rig.
"It was unable to fly again, so we were contacted for help", he added.
The water rail had been restored to health and fitness before leaving.

According to this report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore over the last four years to commemorate the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
Rather, contrary to Modi's claims, during the NDA's rule (between 1999 and 2004), when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was Prime Minister, there came a period when no advertisement was issued by the government over Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002).
Laying the foundation stone of the 182-meter-high 'Statue of Unity' statue of Sardar Patel in Kevdiya, Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, 'Before, there was no advertisement for the birthdays of Sardar Patel.
While records from the DAVP show that UPA has spent 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12, and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel's ads.
When asked about Modi's claims, Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting Manish Tiwari said that the BJP PM candidates do not speak on the basis of facts.
Uhipa had not been able to put any advertisements on Patel in 2008.
Tiwari said that this was due to the economic downturn that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel's advertisements is significantly less than the amount spent on the birthdays and anniversaries of members of the Nehru-Gandhi family each year.
DHIAVP spent Rs 33 crore on print ads for the birth and death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Rs 21 crore for former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Rs 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru.
When asked about this difference, Manish Tiwari said, 'It should not be seen from the point of view of spending on advertising.
Because the price of an ad depends on many things, including things like the size of the ad or the rate of the ad for that year, etc.
The fact is that it shows our dedication, which those who oppose have been unwittingly trying to handle the legacy of a great leader.

Chadveer said that the popularity of the Chief Minister for historical decisions and public works in the state has been enhanced by the fact that the people of the state will crown Hooda for the third time.
The Supreme Court upheld the Obama Health Care Act.
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the health care law in the name of Barack Obama constitutional.
By a vote of 5 to 4, the judges ruled in favor of a separate order of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - under which citizens would be required to purchase or pay health insurance before 2014 - that it was constitutional under the government's power to impose taxes.
Chief Justice John Roberts supported four other liberal members of the court, while other judges Scalia, Thoss, Elliott and Kennedy disagreed.
The court also upheld the remaining 2700-page articles of the law, and said that the health care law's provision that states increase Medicaid eligibility or they lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutional.
The petition was brought by 26 states, as well as the National Federation of Independent Business, to stop this law.
During the 2012 inaugural session, this law was opposed by all major Republican presidential candidates, including project nominee Mitt Romney.
An Australian woman appealed against the Thai prison term.
A 21-year-old Sydney woman who has been sentenced to 15 days in jail in Phuket for falsely accusing a taxi driver of assault, has appealed the decision and has been granted bail.
On June 15, a Phuket provincial court found Stevie Rochelle Bomford guilty of making false accusations against Thai police, alleging that a local taxi driver along with two other individuals tried to stop him on the morning of Sunday, June 10.
But later CCTV footage revealed that she had returned safely to the hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
When Bamfort was questioned by the Phuket police for two days, he admitted to making up the story.
He was detained in the local police station before the trial in court.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention center on the outskirts of Phuket instead of an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has applied to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for his daughter's assistance.
Tungi Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family were "extremely concerned" about their daughter's care and wanted to bring her back to Australia.
"This has undoubtedly been a worrying time for us, but we hope she will be home soon", said Thi Tunks.
Bamford has appealed against the order, and has been granted bail for 50,000 baht.
Meanwhile, a report in Australia said she was vacationing at a crabby holiday resort in southern Thailand.
Thai-based legal sources said that Bamford's case was being fought by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that as a result of an appeal, the court could extend his sentence to two years and force him to serve time in adult prison.
Just as recently after the murder of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be acquitted in an attempt to improve its poor tourist image.
Snowden is ready to "co-operate" with Germany on US surveillance.
Edward Snowden, a US intelligence spokesman, has announced that he is ready to travel to Berlin to testify to parliament in Germany if the US National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, fail to respond to their activities.
German MP Hans Christian Strauh Belih, who met Mr. Snowden on Thursday in Russia, has been granted asylum to discuss testimony in Germany.
In a letter submitted by Mr. Snowden to the media in Berlin on Friday, MP Shashi said: "Although the results of my efforts are demonstrably positive, my government regards dissent as a party-change, and offers no defense that attempts to criminalize political speech with allegations of gangland".
However, speaking the truth has not been a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the international community's support could persuade the U.S. government to drop the criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of government property.
Hanshi Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told online Zeit: "Mr. Snowden is preparing to speak to German officials, so we have to find ways to make this possible".
Relations between the US and Germany have come under pressure as the NSA claims to have bugged Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, MP who is the chairman of the parliamentary committee, oversees intelligence. said that if there was an opportunity for Mr Snowden Kosunne as a witness "without completely ruining relations with the United States and putting them at risk", then it should also be taken.
Mr. Strauss Böll, a member of the Green Party of Germany, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter feed.
He said he was on his trip to Russia with two German journalists.
Mr. Belen said that, according to a former NSA contractor lawyer, if they left Russia, Snowden would not be able to return to Russia.
If Snowden testified in Germany, he would be "safe" there, which would require assurances, the MP said.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he had been forced to leave his home because he had "encountered a terrible and continuous campaign".
However, he said the world is happy and overwhelmed by the wide-ranging reactions to its "work of political expression".
World citizens, including the United States, as well as senior officials, have condemned the disclosure of an irresponsible system of extensive monitoring of a public service.
The letter extends a proposal to cooperate with German authorities "when the problems of the humanitarian situation have been resolved".

The hearing on the bail petition of former military governor General Pervez Musharraf in the case of the murder of the Maulvi of the Red Mosque has been postponed until November 4.
The next hearing in this case against Muşerraf is scheduled for November 11.
In 2007, Maulvi Gazi Abdul Rashid was killed in a military operation against the counterterrorists hiding in the Red Mosque.

Alexis Miller of GagiGazprom described the pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new era.
The head of Gazprom said that the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria has marked the completion of Europe's largest energy projects.
Today a historic event has taken place: construction has begun on the Bulgarian side of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe", Gazprom president Alexi Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security across the European continent.
South Stream, which will diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
Officials said that a dispute over the contract between Gazprom's counterpart and Gazprom in Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas is supplied to Europe, poses a risk to traditional routes.
Miller said that a membership of the European Union meant a direct connection to Bulgaria, an end "forever" to the geopolitical risks associated with gambling with transit countries.
After the entire project is completed in 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive gas at discounted rates from South Stream.
Gaziprom said construction should begin in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed to have an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Report: Considering the Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton by dumping Biden.
According to the New York Times, close advisers to President Barack Obama secretly considered replacing Hillary Clinton as Vice President for the 2012 ticket.
The most notable explosion in the revelation is the highly anticipated 2012 campaign Tom, "Double Down: Change the Game 2012" by Mark Halperin and John Heilman.
The Times received a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that top advisers to the president held "extensive group sessions and polls in late 2011" to find out what Dumping Biden could do to help Obama's falling re-election hopes.
According to Jonathan Martin, a national political correspondent for the Times, the book details the efforts of the chief officials in the campaign and the White House, named after the former White House chief of staff, to find out what effect the change from former Secretary of State Clinton to Vice President has on the polls.
The potential switch was a very secure secret within the infrastructure of the Chicago campaign and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers to the president, including Dr. Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Masina, and former White House senior advisers David Oxlord and David Paluffe, knew the changes were under consideration.
"Double Down" claims that Daley tried to change Biden despite his personal alignment before finally making a decision when his information suggested that Clinton's ticket would not improve Obama's situation.
In an interview with Martin, Dale has confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Clinton with Biden.
"I said this in keeping with the whole scene, and one of them was this", Dalle told the newspaper.
Remember, when the presidency was in jeopardy, we were in a position to ask, "Holy Christ, what else are we to do?"
While Dale described the research as "a precaution", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out how much dividend this claim would yield if the polls were held.
"His campaigns don't spend money like voting and focusing on groups unless they're seriously considering something", Martin told AC360.
It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was looking for change.
Martin told CNN that he asked if his boss knew about the potential change.
While Dahl said he "doesn't think the president was aware of the potential change", the former chief of staff admitted that it was "likely" that Obama was aware of it.
"Hi Double Down" sure: won't answer whether a political inquiry reached Obama's desk?
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama was unaware of the Biden dumping ticket investigation.
"Maybe", Martin said, "but it is possible".
Today he will meet the families of those killed in the Patna rally last Sunday.
A week after the blast, Narendra Modi's second visit to Patna has seen strong security measures in all directions.
Police have thoroughly investigated the route of Modi's visit and the meeting places.
People who attend meetings will be monitored by the police.
Gujarat Police Force, NSGIB and state police will also monitor security.
Modi's security will be tightened and tightened.
Meanwhile, questions have also begun to be raised about the BJP's bone-killing journey to the people killed in the Patnahi blast.
Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has alleged that the BJP is engaged in corrupting the environment.
The Congress has re-issued tickets to all the former lawmakers.
The list includes 6 old faces and 2 new faces.
In the new faces, Pratap Singh Lodi from the Senate constituency of Bina Sagarhi district has been given a chance to represent the Nirmala Sapr and Jabera constituency of Damoh district.
Three of Sagar's, two of Tikamgarh and one of Chhatarpur's MPs have been given tickets again.
As expected, the next candidate has been Narayan Prajapati from Banda, from Surkhiri to Govind Singh Rajput, from Khurai to Arunodey Choube, from Sagar to Rajput.
Ticket has been issued to Vikram Singh Nati Raja from Tikamgarh in Tikhamgarh and Yadavendra- Singh from Tikhamgarh and Brijendra Singh from Prithviraj Rathore and from Rajnagar in Chhatarpur.
All of these are current legislators from these areas.
The match will be contested between new faces from both parties in Bina after the first list of BJP and Congress.
In the Bhina, BJP's Mahesh Rai and Congress's Nirmala Sapr are facing each other.
The incumbent Congress MLA Brijendra-Singa Rathore in Pithirupur in Tikamgarh will be faced by former minister S. Sunil Naik's wife Anita Naik.
The current MLA from Rajnagiri Vikram Singh will challenge Nati Raja by the BJP's Ramakrishna Kusamaria.

The BJP's young leader Parul Sahul is safely pitted against the lawmaker Govind Rajput.
The adaptation of Dennis Diderot's novel by Gilow Nicloaks features excellent production design and time-frame details, but it has gone far beyond what it should have been.
Set in France in 1760, this novel, Suzanne, tells the tragic story of a young nobleman who is sent by a member of his family to the convent.
When she rebels, she is subjected to extreme cruelty at the hands of the self-imposed victim mother Superior, and becomes the object of sexual attraction for the other.
This film never goes into sexual or sensational - and that's the problem.
Due to the seriousness of the storyline, there is also the risk that it will become a boring film for the audience.
A self-contained railroad was found in the U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel.
One of the most complex drug trafficking tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has been found, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. officials have described the four-foot-by-three-foot tunnel as one of the most complex secret routes ever discovered.
The tunnel is roughly the same height as the six-foot football pitch, which connects the warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
This area is filled with similar warehouses, which makes it easy to hide the truck being loaded with drugs.
Officials said the tunnel had already been shut down before any drugs could pass through.
According to court records, authorities have seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel's exploration.
Three people, who officials said were acting as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution purposes.
If convicted, they could face a sentence of 10 years to life in prison.
Smugglers in Noogles, Arizona, take advantage of the vast underground sewerage canals.
This tunnel is the eighth major route discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered since the central Mexican marijuana crop in October, which poses a challenge to drug mafia groups who are able to quickly reach consumers with the product.
In 2010, officials found a roughly 700-yard track equipped with a railroad track that stretched from the tavern of a house in Tijuana to San Diego warehouses.
The meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers was marked by an exchange of greetings between the two.
At the end of the meeting, Singh praised the Chief Minister's speech for the retaliatory attack on Narendra Modi in the meditation camp.
He also said of his speech that he had no other feelings in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges must be met with great care.
The Chief Minister's face was also the same as that of Singh, who took Singh's speech positively.
It is known that Singhhi had urged the Chief Minister to respect the workers in the meditation camp and protect them from alleged harassment of the officers.
However, he also said that in order to keep his word, he was also prepared to be sacked from the cabinet.
By the way, there are fresh ideas about putting workers into government positions after the opinion that has emerged in the meditation camp.
The head of the state JDU at the camp, Vasishta Narayan Singh, had said that the appointment of workers to the 20 committees would be announced soon.
His signal was also that the list was almost ready.
There are reports that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will now personally review the list at his level.
They will also examine whether the opinion of legislators-parliamentarians has been taken into account in the preparation of the list.
If necessary, the list will be extensively revised to accommodate older and committed workers.
The common accusation of legislators-parliamentarians is that their opinions were not taken into account in the preparation of the nomination list.
People from other parties who came much later have been included in the list, while many important activists active since the days of the Swatha Party have been neglected.
Halloween 2013: by numbers.
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay quiet until late, and play dresses up for the neighborhood.
These days, I've become more than just a greedy person.
I haven't even signed up to take candy out of my apartment for the past two years, and probably won't this year.
But statistics show that I was a black sheep when Halloween came.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans are actually spending $158 million this time on Halloween, $6.9 billion on candy, and costumes and decorations.
One thing I've always noticed is the Halloween trends.
According to NRhiF, out of the total cost of $6.9 billion, the cost of clothing is estimated at $1.2 billion.
This year, everyone is angry at sexy inanimate objects.
Women don't have to prostitute themselves; that's a sexy meal like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.
For men, I hope that a lot of zombies, and thankfully, the dead will make space our Instagram feeds for men this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after outfits will be zombies, Batman, robbers and witches.
Hi, I guess there's nothing wrong with being traditional.
Last year we dressed up the dogs and, surprisingly, we weren't alone.
According to NRhiF, Americans will literally spend $330 million on pet clothes.
That's the irony of having too many hot dogs with dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't look around.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year.
Hairshy bars, Lollipop, Milk Dads, Twistlers and Clark Bar are worth around £600 million.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, it's good news that 41 million tricks or tricks are participating in our neighborhood.
But in reality we, and the ones who are joking, will buy 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
According to the Confectioners' Association, one thing we won't use during Halloween is candycorn, but that too will sell for about 35 million pounds.
That's the personal cluster of about 9 billion Mecca.
This is a mystery.hi to solve yet.
Nothing is more elemental than the Halloween Ghost House.
They are the best names, " like the terror behind the wall (which, in fact, is a prison), "cheek-o-cheek" and "the house of shock".
In fact, according to American authorities, there are 1,200 officially approved haunted houses in the United States that produce 500 million rajaswas. and that awful good picture your friend posts on Facebook and the man who likes and comments on you seeing Nice Face.
Finally, let's talk about pumpkin.
Charlie Brown introduced the great pumpkin when we were kids, and a jack-o-lantern carving is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the "Baby in a Pumpkin" trend started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these guards and not hanging out with them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million this year on pumpkins.
The jack-and-jack slowly flashing lantern on its front porch probably came from Illinois, which this year grew from 542 million pounds of pumpkin.
If you're looking for extra credit, try calling Tim and Susan Matisdoshi in Napa, Calif., and above to carve their 2,032 pounds of pumpkin.
Some people are born with silver spoons, while others make life ideal through their hard work and people are inspired by them.
Among such personalities, a name also comes to mind as S. Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of a school teacher in a small village of Chhorwad in Gujarat, was born on 28 December 1932, the third son of the late Hirachand Gowardhandas Ambani.
Thiruvai was the third of five brothers and sisters.
The family's five children include Ramaniklal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilokcha and Jasumati.
Due to financial difficulties, Dhirubhai had to drop out of high school.
Dhirubhai had begun to help the household financially as a child.
At this time they were setting up a shop near Girnarhi, where the income of the shop was limited to the number of tourists coming here.
Talking about Dhirubhai's first job, he arrived in the Yemeni city of Aden in 1949 at the age of 17 on a ship called Kabota.
Here his older brother Ramaniklal had made all the arrangements for him, so he had no problem finding a job abroad.
But there was something else going on in Dhirubhai's mind.
So in 1954 they returned to their homeland.
In 1955, with 500 rupees in his pocket, he arrived in Mumbai to try his luck.
And this is where his business journey began.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani took such steps that he never looked back.
His name became famous not only at home but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on 6 July 2002.
At this time, they owned 62000 crore rupees.
Currently, his sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are in charge of his Sultanate.
Like their father, these two brothers are now among the most famous businessmen in the world.
Who doesn't know the Ambani family today?
Dhirubhai, Kochilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.
Is the upper class of Europe willing to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April and pledged to bring business together and determine what changes the UK's jobs and prosperity makers want to see in our relationship with the EU.
For this we conducted the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders, asking them what they thought of Britain's business with the EU.
Uhi-Gov took into account 1000 business leaders, representing the size, regions and locations of UK businesses.
The findings of this survey may come as a surprise to many.
We found that a large part of the business community now wants to export outside Europe, and to focus on the countries that are becoming modern and growing, while the EU member states are becoming more and more inactive.
They want the government to prioritize new trade relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than engaging in a long-term and nefarious process of reforming the EU's mysterious institutions.
When asked for their views on specific policy areas, from monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that control of these decisive qualities should return to Westminster.
The general dissatisfaction with the single market could be easily seen, with businessmen saying that the cost of regulation by Brussels is far greater than the benefits of being part of the European trading area - even 40 percent of the giant businessmen who traditionally favored European companies agreed.
Lastly and most obviously, our survey of business leaders found that, a large proportion clearly wants Britain to move on the path of trade-based relations and treaty change rather than politics with the EU.
This finding, which was observed at the levels of major business groups, showed that businessmen were pushing for a "significant change" that would restore the UK to its lost power.
It has a very high price - a treaty change for Britain and the issue of getting a better deal changed the vote in the referendum, 16 percent in favour of staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey is the dash that British businessmen support their plan to negotiate terms of UK membership in the EU.
It also showed that businessmen expect to renegotiate the current balance of power by making a meaningful shift in favour of the UK.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and very quickly it is becoming mandatory, as the eurozone moves forward towards a related economy and fiscal union.
Priority should of course be given to jobs and growth in the UK, as the findings of our survey show that for businesspeople this means a new focus on business and a fundamental change in the regulatory system of Brussels.

Dr. Bhandari had a license to practice in Oklahoma.
Last March, a federal jury indicted him for distributing controlled drugs.
He was indicted in federal court in Oklahoma City in April of this year.
However, the jury was unable to reach a conclusion in the relevant case.
The Kenyan press was outraged by the controversial media law.
Challenging the bill as unconstitutional, the newspaper said: "This is a terrible place, and it is legitimate to ask: What is to prevent Parliament from depriving the judiciary of its independence in the coming day?"
Cyrus Kumau, managing director of Capital Group - Kenya's most prestigious independent radio station and news website CapitalFM - said: "This law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it".
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased, because it is part of the government" and that banning content and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send the MPs back".
According to the newspaper The Star, the new bill will provide the government with "strict control over the media", while The Standard said that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had been "shaken badly" and called the bill cruel.
The bill is being passed as part of a measure to strengthen national security following the September Islamic gunman attack on the Westgate shopping mall.
Kenyan media had broadcast security camera footage of the men sent to the scene of the attack, showing them deliberately looting the mall, causing officials to become angry with Kenyan media.
David Kimao, the chief of police at the police station, had summoned two journalists and media workers for questioning, although the summons was withdrawn after a media outcry.
Under the new bill, media companies could be fined 2 crore Kenyan shillings and individual journalists could be fined a million Kenyan shillings and, in addition, the additional risk of being "deleted from the list" or not being recognized by the official press would be different.
If the penalty is not paid, the tribunal also has the right to seize the violator's property.
According to the Daily Nation, "a single fine is enough to shake the foundations of most FM stations".
It also said that these measures could have devastating effects on what Kenya describes as a "living blogosphere".
By shutting down the media, politicians know they can do their own thing.
Mutuma Matthew, a journalist for the Mutih Nation, describes the Kenyan media as a major source of control and balance in public life, writing that "no one will ever know".
He wrote: "If left to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and lead us back to the era of hunting and collecting".
In the past, Kenyan lawmakers have faced public outrage.
In May, he voted to reject the cuts ordered by the National Pay Commission, and restored the tax-free salary of about 532,000 shillings a month, which is considered one of the highest in the world.
Obama's health care proposal was withdrawn.
Amid a flurry of criticism, President Obama yesterday withdrew his often-repeated, misleading promise that "if you like your health plan, you can continue it".
As well as receiving cancellation notices from their providers by millions of people, Republicans have recently criticized the president for misleading American citizens.
Yesterday, President Obama changed his actual message.
In a speech in Boston, he said that "many people who have health insurance, and it is useful, can continue to have it".
Addressing what he calls the "news rush", Obama has graciously bought new coverage on the market from U.S. citizens who have received this information.
Most people will be able to get a better deal, the same amount of money or a comprehensive healthcare plan cheaper than the proposed one.
"You'll get a better deal", he said.
The administration has said that it should come as no surprise that 5 percent of the population who buy insurance with their own money may be forced to change their plans because their coverage does not meet the standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
In a statement to the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington, D.C., Sebelius said, "I tell these American citizens directly, 'You deserve better than this.'"
Sebelius, who is in charge of implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace since October has been "unfortunate".
"I am as disappointed and angry as anyone else", he said.
I want to regain your trust.
After a sharp argument with the Republican yesterday at the House hearing, Sebelius said this sentence in anger to a colleague sitting behind him, which was caught by a Mike.
In a hearing that lasted more than three hours, Longhi repeatedly asked Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act has not voluntarily relinquished government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan through Healthcare.gov, which she is now selling to millions of Americans.

The parents of a teenager in Georgia who was killed in a "strange accident" believe their son was murdered.
A teenager from Georgia whose body was found wrapped in a wrestling mat in his high school gym believes his son was murdered, a family lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, GA, was found trapped inside his high school gym on January 11 in a mat standing directly behind the bleachers.
Investigators from the Lundy County Sheriff's Office concluded that Johnson had died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family denied it.
Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News.com that "they fully believe that their son has been murdered".
They have no confidence in death at all, as the sheriff has told them.
"They believe that this is beyond the laws of physics and the logic of common sense", Crump said.
They feel that this finding is an excuse to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
"He sent his son to school with a book-back, and he came back in a body bag", she said.
U.S. Attorney General Michael Mulroney said Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, considering that many important questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?hi
Was he murdered for a crime?
Muhire said these things at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will abide by the facts, wherever they take us.
My goal is to bring the truth to light.
"I think there are environmental reasons for a formal investigation", he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy showed that Johnson died as a result of "static respiratory arrest".
According to Moorehi, a second autopsy revealed a different cause of death".
"There are many questions that must be answered or confirmed", he said.
Moore also said that if he found enough evidence to summon a criminal in Johnson's death case or to investigate civil rights, he would ask the FBI to do so.
When contacted Thursday, a representative from the Londage County Sheriff's Office was not immediately available for comment.
On Wednesday, a judge in southern Georgia ordered the authorities to release all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope the video footage will give some indication of how he died.
Addressing a rally, Modi said, "You look at the speeches of Congress or other leaders in the last two months, and you will find that they do not talk about what they have done".
"Congress has become so arrogant that it does not answer media questions", he said.
Manmohan Singh is the prime minister and his government is in power, yet he needs answers from Modi.
It is your duty to answer to the public.
Modi was apparently responding to Sibbal, who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wants his controlled environment where he gives his speech and does not speak to them to avoid questions from journalists.
Shibbal also challenged Modi to argue face to face.
"I promise the people of the country that when the BJP forms a government in 2014, we will present a report to the people every year", Modi said.

Bhi Blair says they want Britain back.
Tony Blair said he would like to have a second chance at becoming Prime Minister of the United Kingdom - but he believes there is no possibility of a comeback.
In an interview on the eve of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's Office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After leaving office in June 2007 after a decade as leader, Mr Blair largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his remarks to his role as a representative of foreign affairs and peacekeepers of the Middle East group.
Asked if he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Mr Blair was presented by London's Evening Standard newspaper as saying: "Yes, of course, but that is unlikely, so...hi"
He urged the leaders of the world not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.

Do you like glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first globe-in-the-hi-dark ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has made great use of marine animals to develop a great breakfast.
He came up with the idea after reading a paper on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to use chemical glow to polish proteins.
Ice cream, eaters react with their tongue to increase the pH of protein and the ice cream will glow.
Chris says that ice cream is glowing with a reaction to the heat of the mouth, meaning the more it is chewed, the more glow it will be.
Charlie, founder of the I'm Delicious ice cream company, said: "It's incredible, but in the early days of production, I'll get about 2 grams of stuff from £200".
The protein we are using in ice cream will react with neutral pH in the tongue.
As soon as the mouth is warmed, the protein will increase the pH level and the ice cream will glow.
We've been testing it for the past few months and it looks perfect to share on Halloween because it gives an amazing glow effect.
This will probably be the most expensive ice cream that Menehi has ever made because the gloss of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So every scoop costs me around £140.
Although the air taste is very good.
Charlie's Bristol-based experimental company, known for its unusual taste, including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaf.
But his next work is about to prove even more ambitious.
"I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream", he said.
This is naturally impossible because of the ice crystals that create a deformation on top of the ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream is useful for the anti-glare properties of a jellyfish, which has been synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Even in the lowlands, the rain continued to rain in the midst of the sunshine.
At the same time, a cold wave has begun throughout the plaintiff.
The cold can be estimated from the fact that the minimum temperature in Srinagar has reached 4.8 degrees Celsius, in Gulmarg below zero -0.2 degrees Celsius and in Leh -1.8 degrees Celsius.
Leh was the coldest in the entire state.
Meanwhile, the strategically important Srinagar-Lehh National Highway has been closed to traffic due to rain and snowfall.
Heavy snow has fallen on the Johi Jhila Pass.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall of the season in the mountainous areas of Kashmir.
Due to the activation of the Western turmoil, early on Wednesday, a period of snowfall in the high mountainous areas of the plain and rainfall in the lowlands began, which continued until late evening.
The cold also affected the normal public life.
To avoid the cold, people stayed indoors.
Meanwhile, power supply was also cut off in many areas.
The maximum daytime temperature in Srinagar was recorded at 13.7 degrees Celsius, four degrees below normal.
In Jammu, too, the cold has increased at night due to heavy rain and heavy winds.
The minimum temperature in Jammu was recorded at 16.6 and the maximum at 27.0 degrees Celsius.
According to the Department of Meteorology, the impact of the Western Turbulence has begun to diminish and the weather will improve from Friday.
According to Sonam Lots, director of the Srinagar-based Meteorological Department, the weather in the plaintiff is likely to be dry from November 1 to November 7.

The court has blocked action on the NYPD's break and sports policy.
A federal appeals court on Thursday ruled that the New York Police Department's pause and sports program requires a judge's order, blocked the changes and removed the judge from the case.
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Shira Schindler of 2nd and has said that the judge's decision will delay the outcome of an appeal by the city.
In August, Judge Nagar had ruled that it violated the constitution by excluding people from its program of arrest and interrogation.
The city's police department has appealed its findings and its order to change its policy and its training program, including the decision to allocate a monitoring unit to help change its policy and its training program.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments on the request for immigration on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeals has held that because it agreed to the requirement for a judge to avoid the presence of bias in a series of media interviews and to be disregarded by the public from the code of conduct for U.S. judges, such misconduct should therefore be removed from the judge's case, statements should be made publicly accountable for criticizing the court.
The judge ruled that police officials wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its pauses and sports program.
She has appointed an external monitor to monitor major changes, including economic reforms in policies, training and supervision, and she has ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some campuses where she closes most often.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were dismissed after a police arrest.
An oral argument on the appeal of the Municipal Court is scheduled for some time after March 14, 2014.
The pause and sports tactic has been criticized by civil rights advocates.
The sports and leisure policy has been around in some form for decades, but has mostly been recorded by black and Hispanic men, from 684330 to an all-time high in 2011 that stops the growth dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all minorities, and became a class action lawsuit.
A supporter of the change in the NYPD's rest and sports program has said that inappropriate behavior will end, a more reliable and effective police force will be formed and other police departments may affect the use of policies.
Opponents say the change will weaken the morale of the police, but it will solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure from the shrinking of thousands of officers during the past decade, including crime, money wasting and not just the police force.
The judge noted that while the Court did not set a statute of limitations for breaks and sports, which is constitutional, it improved the implementation of the NYPD's stop.
If the new government continues its policy of stopping the sale of kerosene through rationing after the general election, then in half a dozen states, kerosene will not be available in these stores.
The states that are to ban the sale of kerosene include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand.
Apart from this, there are also preparations to close the sale of kerosene in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and some states in the northeast.
According to sources from the Ministry of Petroleum, a decision to stop the sale of kerosene at PDS stores in the states will be taken on two grounds.
The first is that the rural areas are being built with fast electricity connections.
The second base is the LPG connection.
That is, the sale of PDS kerosene is being discontinued in states where most rural households have been given gas connections to the kitchen.
The Ministry of Petroleum has made solid preparations in this regard.
Since October 2013, the sale of PDS kerosene in Delhi has already been suspended.
Sources say that under this policy, the kerosene quota has been significantly reduced to Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand.
The Punjab quota was reduced from 2.72 lakh kg to one lakh kg.
The Uttarakhand allocation of 70 per cent was cut, while Haryana's kerosene quota was cut by about 40 per cent.
Despite this cut, no reports of kerosene shortages have been received from these states.
The ministry believes that it is clear that kerosene has been used for smelting.
The price difference between the petrol and diesel PDS is currently Rs 37 crore.
This promotes mixers.
In the states where sales through PDS will be discontinued, oil companies will sell kerosene at full price on the open market.
At present, oil companies are losing more than Rs 39 per litre on kerosene.
The burden of kerosene subsidies in 2013-14 is estimated to be around Rs 31 thousand crore.
A legal awareness camp was held at the middle school Dalheer in Ramnagar on behalf of the Tehsil Legal Services Committee, headed by the committee chairman and Ramnagar's deputy judge, Sandeep Kaur.
In which students and others were informed of the right to education and the law for the economically backward.

A large number of villagers were present at the event.
Ben Greenman: The tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: The New Yorker is coming up.
People can argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in the United States: about a hundred years ago, comedian and playwright Frank Fey, who served as master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to play jokes directly to the crowd in a conversational manner.
Fahi's quest has expanded over the years, most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and hosted by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the standup institute called Carolyn's Carolyn's, the festival celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows in small clubs and big theaters.
"Most of these headliners appeared in the Carolinas, and became huge successes, to the point where they became too big to play in clubs", Hirsch says.
We built this celebration as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the attendance of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the annual musical and comedy benefit for military retirees at Madison Square Garden, "Stand Up for Heroes" featuring Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.
As the festival expanded, so did the world of comedy.
Many of the comedians participating in this year's festival have come from non-traditional media, such as shows coming to small networks like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has, from the deep-cable sitcom (F.X.X.'s joyfully ranch fantasy-football-themed "The League") reached the mainstream, and now has his own comedy central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member on Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series "Marshall the Shell with Shoes On".
Other young comedians with different voices, including Crawl and Slate (Anthony Jassalnik, with a completely different, frustrating voice, satirical, ethnically focused W. Kameau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg speaking to Larry David:
Stienberg started out as a standup comedian, but he has become a well-known television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting will be held at the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's works", said Stienberg.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he would walk down the street between two buildings and think to himself that if I ever lost all my money, I would stay here.
Moving through the soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical care.
Dr. Georges Well is providing free healthcare in rural areas of Cameroon.
Wehi Well and her team see hundreds of patients almost every weekend.
There are not many doctors in West African countries; there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people.
Vote here or by phone.
Dr. George Well is one of CNN's top 10 heroes in 2013.
You can vote for them or for someone else in the top 10 to make CNN's Hero of the Year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George Well had watched his sick father fall asleep and unconscious, heading to the hospital, who was not properly equipped to help him.
Jahiamel Well was injured in a car accident near Yunde, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
Initially, only his arm was broken, but an infection spread that spread to his brain, and it produced a blood clot, which affected the rest of his life.
"There was no neurosurgery in Cameroon", says Jorge Well.
If we had money, we would have taken our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Weil kept on taking his father around crowded clinics and hospitals and getting whatever treatment he could.
"It's not easy", said Hi Well.
You leave your home at 5am in the hope that you will be the first person to arrive at the hospital, but this is not the case.
There are many patients there.
Some people may be waiting for death to come to an end.
Since the death of Weil's father in 2002, the situation has not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
In comparison, there is one doctor for every 413 individuals in the United States.
And even if there are doctors there, many Cameroonians cannot afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and about two-thirds of the country's healthcare spending is in the private sector.
"Their only problem is poverty", says Hi Well.
And because they are poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his father and his countrymen, Val was determined to do something about it.
Dr. George and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He himself became a physician, and began working as a vascular surgeon at the Centre Hospital in Yundehi.
And he started the non-profit organization Escrowweim, which travels to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday they and up to 30 people sit in a van, tie up medical supplies from the rooftops and go to rural areas where people need medical care.
Sometimes luck doesn't even come with them.
More than once they have to push the vehicle through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are truly honored with heroes: feasting, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the community can offer.
Free medical care in these villages is truly a cause for celebration, and well - with its great smile and endless energy - involves joy and delight.
The next morning his team began to meet hundreds of patients.
"We're meeting 500 people on each trip", said Hi Well.
They come from about 60 km from the village of Wehi, and they come on foot.
All of these weekend clinics offer a variety of medical services.
Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get a baisahi, donated glasses or a free birth certificate - this document is required at school but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery with local anesthesia.
The operations are usually performed in a school building, town hall or home; after the procedure, the patient walks to the recovery area, making room for the next person.
The group's generator illuminates the operating room and sanitation equipment, and Welle and her volunteers get up early on Sunday morning to work.
It's a slow pace, but village musicians usually help keep the troupe motivated.
"They keep playing drums all night long to keep us awake and keep us going", said Hi Well.
When his team returns to town on Sunday, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group - which includes doctors from Cameroon and foreign medical students - performed 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their help can change the world of the people they help.
One person said that getting free hernia surgery would allow him to return to work.
"It will change the future of me and my family", said the man.
In addition to running a weekend clinic and working as a hospital surgeon, Well also works at night in a private medical clinic around Yunde.
He explained that this is his second job, which finances 60% of his non-profit work; the rest is done through private donations.
"I don't know when they're going to sleep", said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in the Well's group.
They are always either in the hospital, or trying to raise money for their organization, so that they can continue to run these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Welle's campaign, this is an experimental opportunity that they can never get in their own country.
"In the surgical field in which we help Dr. Well to hold tools or clean up blood stains, we have been able to gain experimental experience", O'Malley said.
As a second-year medical student in the U.S., you will never have the opportunity to do so.
Volunteer students usually spend on their own to reach Cameroon, and they often come with donated medical supplies.
But after arriving at Yunde, they are well-versed in their stay and the cost of the instructions.
"There is no doubt that they are heroes", says O'Malley.
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon will never end.
For Whi Well, almost the same workload, it's not difficulty.
Helping others live happy lives, fulfilling a promise to their father, these are the things that bring them great joy.
"I am very happy doing this job", says Hi Well.
And I think about my father.
I hope they're watching what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, to ease their pain.

A proposal has been sent to the regime by the ADA in this regard, which will soon be sealed.
Surrounded on three sides by the Ganga-Yamuna, this historic city no longer has a plot on which the ADA could make a major housing plan.
In this regard, he has now decided to plan a residential development ahead of Zhongsi to the east, Fafamuhi to the north and Naini to the south.
A meeting chaired by District Magistrate Rajshekharhi was held to give a comprehensive outline to this plan.
AHIDA has proposed to incorporate two hundred revenue villages of Fularpur, Sorav and Karchna.
Once they reach the AHIDA's limits, the Chak and Bharad Block will be gone.
Half of the Kauridihar block will also be merged into the ADA.
According to Amarnath Upadhyay, Secretary of AHDA, a proposal has been sent to the government in this regard.
ADA intends to take the boundaries of these village panchayats into its own jurisdiction to plan, on which work will begin soon.
If this happens, the rising prices of buildings in the city will fall.
At the same time, housing will be easily available to the general public.
Soon residential palaces will be built in this new area on the lines of Lucknow and Noida.

Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as powerful figures clash.
With a statue of the founder of Mozambique, President Samora, staring down at them, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo for a rare public demonstration to chant peace.
"We want peace back, we want stability", said Vanessa de Sussa, CEO of an investment firm.
Frightened about the future of her country, she changed her corporate dress with a "We demand security" printed T-shirt in a Portuguese and she joined the crowd at the capital's Freedom Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, clashes between government forces and Re Nomohi have been reported almost daily, since more than 20 years ago, a peace agreement was signed.
Rehi Namo was once a notorious rebel of the movement initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will return to a fully developed conflict, but recent developments have discouraged foreign investors and locals alike.
The stakes are high for a rapidly growing economy. Exploring the vast offshore gas reserves of the Northwest and the coal reserves of Rio Tinto, some of the companies including Brazil's Vale, Eni and others could bring in over $50bn in investment next year.
The ruling Frelimohi Party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Rae Nomo blame each other for the tension.
Rey Namo says that the government launched the latest conflict by launching attacks on its members on October 17 in Sofa La Province, traditionally a Rey Namo stronghold.
As the attacks on former rebels and their rise increased, government forces attacked Renmo bases and Afonso Dhaka Ma, the group's leader, Fernando Myang, tried to kill Ray Nimo's spokesman, Financial Times reported.
The government blames Ray Namo for triggering the clash, accusing the army of attacking the Nazis.
President Armando Jibuzan has called for a discount on concerns about instability.
Mr. Jibuzhahi told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhakaama saw himself as a "loser" "whoever he is, continues to try to prove to his forces that he can enforce his own decision on the government".
Both Freehi Limo and Ray Nemo insist that they want to avoid war.
Mr. Myanghi was quoted as saying that the 1992 peace agreement was cancelled by Ray Namo but has since become a matter of concern.
He told FT that he meant that the agreement was not being awarded by Free Limohi.
Our vision is to come back for the settlement negotiations, but seriously", Mr. Myangnehi said.
The last talks between the two sides did nothing to ease the tensions of a series of conflicts this year.
"This is about two big men (Gibuzha and Dhaka) fighting together", said Joseph Han, a lecturer and Mozambican expert at London Open University.
None of them are good negotiators, nor are they necessarily prepared to make concessions.
Rahi Namo, who has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already spoken about boycotting the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted their use of force as an attempt by a patient movement to win concessions and economic plunder from the government.
Rae Namohi's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a new party, formed by a former Rae Namohi member in which the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) hopes to improve its performance in elections, is being formed.
Mr. Myanghi says that Mr. Jibuzanko - who is leaving office at the end of his second term next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want a multiparty democracy, he does not want to give up the presidency because he does not want peace, he does not want transparent elections", Mr. Myang said.
It has not been clarified what kind of capability Ray Nimo has, but it is a major North-South highway where he has made disruptive hit-and-run tours of police stations and vehicles.
Most of the clashes have taken place in the province of Menay, several hundred kilometers north of Zomaputo, which hosts the port of Bera, which relies on coal exported by miners, including Rio Tinto and the Valley.
In June, after the threat of an attack on the RAIHI NAMO line, Rio suspended its experiment for about a week.
When asked whether Rae Namohi would be able to repeat this threat, Mr. Myangvinit was almost there.
"Things were not going well in Mozambique that wanted to warn the international community", Mr. Myang said.
The government of instability has further exacerbated the riots, says Fernando Lima, head of an independent media company, many people are also concerned about corruption, slow growth and the recent flood of kidnappings.
"The people responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and I think he should be one to find solutions to problems", they say.
Ohimar Sultan, an exhibitor, the people still need sustainability.
"No one cares about the Ray Nemo and Free Limo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the streets", he said.

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February.
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will make a new cardinal of the Catholic Church on February 22 for the first time in his tenure.
Cardinals, the highest ranking clergy in the Catholic Church, have a position only below the Pope, and they elect the Pope, so Francis will appoint a first group of his individuals, who will eventually help choose his successor.
There are currently a total of 201 cardinals there.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in the election of the pope - they fall into the group of 120 "cardinal electors".
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the ceremony of promoting the new cardinals, a meeting of all existing cardinals will be held, called the Papal Assembly.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to hold the February papal council in advance, so as to make it easier to plan other meetings involving cardinals from different countries of the world", Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February the number of cardinal electors was likely to decline.
He said that the Pope generally declares as many cardinals as the number of cardinal electors is less than 120, as well as cardinals over the age of 80, as he chooses.
Valero said next year's papal conclave will be important, as it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year.
There is currently a kind of bias towards Europe and Italy in particular.
"It will be interesting to see if new popes, cardinals from the rest of the world, are also nominated to restore the balance.
Forty percent of South Americans are Roman Catholics, but there are very few cardinals.
The Council of Cardinals by Francishi - a group of eight cardinals from around the world whose job it is to find ways to reform the church - will also be the first cardinals elected after the formation of the Council.
Before that, the Pope made all decisions on his own.
"Francis has now chosen these eight cardinals to assist him", Valero said.
He said it was "possible" that Francis would seek advice from the Cardinals.
But we are not the first in this situation - it is a whole new one.
Valero said that the pope usually gives the cardinal's title to the bishop of large places, but Francis "was quite surprising - so we don't know whose name they will announce".
Foreign employees on a 457 visa can pass a "validity" test.
A "validity" test for foreign employees on 457 visas is being considered by the government, as it aims to expand a strict procedure.
If adopted, the test will be applied through a standard designed to prevent 457s from filling unskilled jobs in Australia or being used to pass them off to family and friends in a clandestine manner.
A government discussion paper was issued today, denouncing the government's gossip about foreign employees, and former Labour MP Maxine McQuaid said today that it could anger Australia's neighbours.
He told the America India Institute today that "foreigners are reaching the end of Qatar" and that the loud rhetoric about "Australians getting jobs first" is a very unpleasant repetition at a time when unions have been demanding a safe labor market.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected - and I wouldn't be surprised if some people in the area had seen the echo of that historical evidence.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures, which were first considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met with officials about people smugglers, has implemented five proposed changes, while the rest are pending.
If the "validity" criterion is adopted, the visa applicant can be checked to see if the registration is true in circumstances where the applicant is the owner of the visa sponsor or a relative or personal partner of the relevant person.
Businessmen may need to keep track of the number of 457 visa holders, as the first businessmen who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees hired hundreds of people.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving in a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man's distraught nine-year-old son had come to Australia with him on a voyage, and after his father died on Wednesday, an adult cousin of his has been hanged by a thread, who was on the same ship.
Australian authorities transported the man to a Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
