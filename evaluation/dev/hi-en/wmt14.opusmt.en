RBS tracked two level traders
The Royal Bank of Scottberg has transformed two traders from their foreign U.S. companies into two traders from the state of exchange, which has received this information from two non-representers, which is the other sign that the U.S. presidents are moving ahead of the global testing speed which is going to pass through the suspect market.
Some of the world's largest banks, with UBS barchage, Dsh Banks and RBS, have confirmed that the world's largest financial market, with a population of $5.3 Trillian, is the world's largest financial market, which exchanges $5 per day, in testing-time.
These two traders will be the first staff of RBS, to be checked with the case that appears to appear to be resurfaced by librigation of the rBS.
The bank has confirmed that a bank has been requested to notice the reminders from this month.
Two weeks ago the bank said, "Our investigation in this case continues, and we're at full cooperation with FCA and others."
The previous month, the case said that RBS sent the former trader and sent records of new mail and quick messages from them to the UK, financial rights authorization.
This trader named Richard Hecker left RBS in 2010, and it is thought to have been released from its present position on the European head of W.P.P. spots of Europe.
The head of European spots in the city went to the holiday holiday, while the former Activist trader in Barcage and UBS had been transferred by this week by the St.
None of these traders have been accused of any wrong action.
The case was pointed out that Mr. Usscher's quick message group includes Barlasage and CTubephos bankers.
UBS said that after being informed by symbs, mammama, she's been diagnosed with a lot of foreign currency testing the market's suspecting a lot of syphilis in the back, this week she has acted against some of her employees.
At least six authorizations on global level - the European Commission, the competition for FCA, FCA, the Justice Department at WCA, and the Hong Kong Service Department in US.
People familiar with the case told them that, HSBC, Citygroups, J.P.orm.
The bank has carefully checked the quick message and email in looking for a clue to a wrong activity.
The news about testing, has caused a stir in the traders of the area, which have been among the most important people who profit in investment companies for the past several years, but they are facing this challenge because they have been missing out on less-way opportunities because of being involved in emergency cases.
Some bankers tried to suppress the case by saying that a lot of giant and highly favored foreign currency is impossible view in the Exchange market, but the senior traders say that this isn't necessarily true.
The senior trader said that despite the enormous magnitude of foreign sales trade-seasing sales platforms, the distribution of the Liquid business platforms and the increased use of his own plate platforms means that you can begin to affect the market on less tickets value."
The news came the same day when Mr. Wells called in London the business contract to trader from his xised business desk this week, which had lost nearly $6 million in the end of the last year.
The bank immediately notifys the consistent authorizations and cooperates with his orders.
"We believe that trader worked alone, and he has been controlled."

The British government has announced a study to increase the benefits of Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
Work by HS2 points to high speed services in the north of Scotland and England, which will soon begin with the first phase in 2026.
The Transport minister Barry told Cream that this project would be one of the "Britain"
The Transport minister of Scotland said that he is very "constitutable" by working with the British government in this project.
The first phase will include a new high speed train between London and West Middleas.
When the second phase is complete, the lines will reach ranges and Leades.
In June, the government transferred the cost of high speed link between London and northern England to 232 B.7 B.C.E. and fixed $422.66 (U.S.).
The British government, who was conversing with Scotland transport, directed HS2 lemmededed to consider the potential and potential of the journey to North England and Scotland.
It includes the possibility of losing or reducing the potential travel time from Glassgo and Edinburgh to London for about three hours or less.
Hates: "Our goal forHS2 is the real national network, which will draw the UK and its cities."
We're moving with HS2, because its benefits will be much more.
Without it we'll face problems related to our railway network's ability.
But this is also about the connect of 18 cities in Britain, including Glassgo and Edinburgh, which will be more closely linked to HS2.
Scottish Secretary Everettler, according to: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed the return of Scotland from Mr. Carler to HS2 network.
Mr. Brown explained: "The high speed train is the possibility of a high - speed financial advantage to Scotland, but it also increases the financial burden on Scotland on high - speed trains throughout Britain.
So we're excited to work in the partnership of the British government to bring high speed trains into Scotland, to create benefits for all and to investigate the options to fulfill the Glass-Expend Line, which Scott's government is planning already.
I'm willing to review the investigation report with the British State counselors next year and make a decision together on the further action.

Black box in your car?
While the U.S. street schemeers are struggling to reduce wealth to improve high-way systems, many are looking at the solution to the smallest black box, which fits the dashboard on your car's dashboard.
The device, which tracks every mile used by the automobile and directs the information to the authorities, is now old enough to raise the U.S. major streets in Washington and the Kingdom Ministry.
The boring task, like high school, has become a sudden debate and issue of life-sanity.
You've joined the Libretans to collect details of the location drive, and probably the use of this information to prepare a tax bill - to allow the government to use these black boxs.
The tea party's fun.
American citizens are also very concerned about picking up a variety of privacy issues.
While Congress couldn't agree whether to take further action, not much of the state waiting.
They're searching how in the next decade they can go to a system in which a driver should pay for every mile fixed on the road.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black box for test drive, some of which have G.P.S.
It's really essential for our country.
"It's not about whether or not to be selected by us," says Hazen Icara, the executive director of the South California government, who is planning to track every mile fixed by motorists in California by 2025.
We're going to change the way to pay taxes.
It's technology to do this.
The main reason for this is that the country's high-way trust has become virtually derived, which pays the taxes paid on gas pumps by American citizens.
American people don't buy more gas than ever before.
Now the car goes over more miles in a gallon gas.
There was no increase in the Federal Council for the past 20 years, which is 18.4 St.
Because of the high value of gas, politicians also avoid increasing a money in the tax tax.
"It's definitely not honorable," says the Transport policy specialist Letic at the University of Massachusetts.
His state has recently planted a tracking device in 500 cars to test the per-mill pay system.
They say, "It will work as the most reasoning option in the past."
Vaves call it milestone-based user fee.
It's not surprising that this idea sounds good to the urban generousists, because it can be changed to change the methods for driving as a car, which can help lower the temperature and reduce greenhouse gases.
Chasy's plans for this system are eager, whereas they are developing strategy to complete the goal set in the great global global airing laws of the state.
But the president of the Home Transport Committee, Ring. Bill Hester (a.P.P.) also consider the most long option to the Black Box.
Even free dealers in Stateization are in favor of payment every mile by the driver.
"It's not just something that is going to be in the blind well, " said Adrian Moore, the vice president of policy."
People are paying more clearly for what they're receiving.
The campaign has also supported two former American transportaries, who had favored their report from Congress to Congress on the direction of per-mill payments in the year 2011.
The U.S. Sensor accepted a trial project for 90-partian dollars last year, including 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural method-operation, which were representative of people who had to walk too many miles to cry for work or to go to town.
Yet many kingdoms and cities themselves are moving in this direction.
It has the most willing Oregen, who listed 5,000 drivers in the biggest use in the country.
These drivers are going to pay Ishmaelage fees instead of gasing the Kingdom.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illino is trying with truckers on the limited basis.
And the I-95 Association, including 17 state transport departments with the eastCboard, is studying how they can survive this change.
This idea did not get supported in all places.
The drivers were very impatient to think that the government could monitor every step they took.
"Bigra Bonhamer and other types of information were a major problem," says Aluvin Khan, who guided the strategy and the operational administration in Nevada transport department.
This isn't something people wanted.
At the same time, Nevada's A.L.U.A. warned on her website: "It would be quite easy to convert these device into full tracking device."
There's no need to develop huge, unconstitutional technology structure, which everyone must be able to keep a record of crying and going.
Nevada is one of the many states that she's doing all she can to achieve potential technology, with which the Kingdom can find out how many miles a day the car is going, but not where and where it's going.
Khan said that if you can do this, people can feel more comfortable.
This technology sought to bring some state agencies closer to the small Calypania Start-up, named Truz.
This firm wasn't basically in business helping the state taxists.
It was attempting to enter an auto insurance market, which had to pay the drivers on the basis of their payies.
But the device that this is testing has made highway easier because it doesn't have the use of GPS and provides too limited information, which is uploaded by modems at the fixed speed.
"If you don't track people's speed and their place, they'll be more willing to adopt this way of life if you don't track them."
There have been some serious mistakes in these early programs of the state.
There are also very low expenses and less intervention methods to do this.
In Oregan, planning drivers are using various options.
They can choose the device on GPS or without GPS.
Or don't choose any device again, but you can choose to pay dues to the average mile set by the inhabitants of the state.
Other places hope that the device can be sold to anxious citizens by providing more assistance than in the device.
In New York City, the transportation authorities are trying to develop a taxing device that allows you to pay the tax fees, which will provide "pay insurance" according to your drive, and make up real speed data from other drivers using motor - drive traffic to avoid motor - drive traffic.
The city center has been mentioned in the document, "mocator-manicators will be attracted to sharing in it because of the benefits it received."
Some transportation schemes wonder, though, that all the discussion on payment for miles is a big distraction.
The Action Transport Commission in San Francisco Bay has said that the Divalia High Court can easily deal with the problem of High Trust Fashion by increase in Congress gas tax.
The extra time or annual fees on Hybrid or other cars can also be paid, whose vehicles don't use too much gas so that they can pay their proper part.
Redy Routler, director of the Commission's Department and public cases, said, "What does there need for surgery when it is possible to work with a patient?"
If we do that, millions of car drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.
The Rapa Nui High Court, Mr. city: former prime minister, involved in Congress from the Rounn Khan group, is supposed to have removed the safety of the former prime minister Hashn Khan from the Congress as a result of police action.
Khan held the state government responsible for this, saying that their security has been removed from political reasons.
Betrayed that from Shopps to PPD's ticket year in 2002 was included in their research team, with slaves winning a choice in 2002 in the election ticket.
The Deshan Khan said that I've had security armor only since 1996.
I dwell in showies, called the fortress of terrors.
There was a security belonging to CRPF on my home.
There are with me: but all my security was taken away suddenly.
As security gloves were going from my home, I spoke to Gulzi and David Epe.
But instead of restoring security, that's just what he said he'll investigate this case.
In this context, however, when Uri Abdi Gynymir was contacted, however, he denied the information about the case and said that it was a sensitive case.
I'm going to check how a former minister and a senior leader's safety has been removed.
The province Congress Chief Profundin said that there is nothing I know about.
It's very serious if Huan Khan's security has been compromised.
I'm at this moment walking in the next two days.
I'll discuss this issue with the relevant administration.

The US federal aircraft administration has opened the option to change American air-booters' processes, so that passengers will be able to read e-book, watch video or play games during the important flight phase, if they can play the equipment "boon" mode.
Travelers can still do this during many flights, but it's not good to be able to reach your e-book method when flying and flying.
The Australian Aircan Service companies are considering the decision, which will act too much to work on the need to meet the need, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plan to change their processes.
The government Planan Security Authority also said that he was thinking about the announcement, but cored that the use of power equipment still in Australia is effective in the important stages of flying.
"The current of CASA is not a special tool capable of controlling power flows in the plane's near CASA," said the authorization, "as it always comes under the wings of the aircraft to ensure that the security system is always built, and the passengers follow instructions given by crew members."
Horinator who's already talking with CASA about expanding the use of his In-FFitite entertainment system, is willing to comply with this change, but he asked to take action on the pilot's instructions.
"We'll welcome a review by CASA about the permission to use electrical devices, because we actually feel it'll give customers better experience, because now we have in our plane."
Quantas said he would follow the current rules right now.
It said, "We can't be used to fly according to our current policy and use electric devices during the plane landing, and we have no immediate plan to change it."
FAA decide applies to the U.S. Elberlines.
Well, we're always interested in advance developments that can benefit travelers, and we'll surely consider FA's decision and reasons behind them.
The effect of this decision, every US airpower company, will separate and depend on the lives of their aircraft.
Airplanes will need to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio activity from mobile devices, as well as to give short details about their rules, training materials, safe-hand bags, and passengers.
FAA said that after their aircraft's ability to carry, he would allow passengers to have control over all obstacles, light weight equipment, such as Tebet, e-ither and smartphones.
In rare cases of low loss, the crew will direct the crew to close their equipment during the plane's landing.
The group has also suggested keeping heavy equipment safely under the seat or in the upper container during the flight and landing.

In the meantime an important committee of American Parliament has approved a lawsuit to restrict national security agency's surveillance activities.
Its purpose is to renew surveillance and renew transparents and restore belief among people that has been hurt by the spread of large phone tape tapes.
Six American companies with Google, Yahoo, this step of the Senator have welcomed.
The NSA has broken through the data centers of these companies too.
The Senator's Committee passed on Friday foreign secret surveillance on NSA from 4 to 11 above 11 of the lawn code (FIX) on NSA.
A number of restrictions are mentioned in this law to restrict a single phone tape under the American Patrity Act.
Her use of data will be deliberately collected under FISA and considered crime and paid for ten years in prison sentence.
This law will become lawal after both the Congress House of Receptive and Senistal.
The president of the committee and the Sendin vondin said that NSA's phone program is under law, and I believe it has contributed greatly to the security of the country.
But in spite of this, there should be another transparency in it.
Also, the security of the public should be taken care of.
Meanwhile, according to NSA's Internet surveillance program, angry Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Appall, and Facebook have supported this law.
In the letter to the surgeons, these companies have said that we welcome this offer of anthropists who have a phone record on NSA's large scale.
It is interesting that exage workers removed a curtain from the documents issued by Edward Snowden from NSA's actions.
In the international community, there is a special outrage when a conversation between the nations of Germany and France has been revealed by NSA has been made to appear on the telephone of the United Nations General Assembly of Germany and France.
John Kerry said that the U.S. spy "has gone too far."
John Kerry's protective attitude on his surveillance program by allowing John Carri to accept unexpected acceptance has indicated that at times his spyer "is going too far."
The state minister has also admitted that they are guilty of getting into the presence of NSA's spy activities as an anti-conception post on Edward Snowden as being at the "mediable pilot" on the matter of being at Obama.
This secretman has brought the U.S. government to the conflict with its allies.
Speaking through a video link at London's Free Government Assembly, Mr. Kerry said: "There's no question that the president, me, and others in the government really knew about some things that would happen to the automation pilot, because then look back and see the second world war years, and then, surely, there was 9/11 capacity.
They have become members of the first high class of U.S. government, who have admitted that the U.S. spy has violated his limit, but that no one has been abused by anyone's rights.
He said: "In some cases, it has gone too far."
And presidents are determined to try to make this clear to people and are still reviewing jewelry so that no person gets involved with abuse.
I assure you that there's nothing wrong with innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry insisted that, however, there was an effort to pursue good purpose, and its surveillance has saved many lives.
He added: "We're faced with a world where people are ready to blow themselves."
There are fanatics in the world who are bent on killing people and attacking governments.
So what is the problem if you are able to stop it before it occurs?
We've actually dropped the plane, destroyed buildings, and saved people from being murdered because we're able to know about the plans of others.
Meanwhile, on Thursday, the president of European cases said that to help out of concern for the so - called U.S. spy into foreign countries to solve concern about the U.S. laws will go into Europe, and European countries will strive to explain corruption-s.

"It is really important for the European countries to be with us in terms of our terrorism efforts, and the official foreign relationship of European cases said in Washington's interview, "U.S. security interests," it is really important for the European countries to be with us in terms of our terrorism efforts."
In order to make it clear that we need to work together to fight terrorism, which should not affect their anger about an NSA program.
News reports from NSA to record millions of European phone conversations have made the difference between some associates of U.S. lands in the U.S.A., although the director of the United Nations said these reports are not entirely correct, and not to mention a misunderstanding of the United Nations sharing these reports with the Joint United Nations by Natto nations.

NSA accuses the website to crash instead of "normal error"
The secret national security agency on Friday told some technically that our website was closed for hours, not because of what some claimed to be online.
The secret agency said in advance: "Today NSA was not in access to NSA.gov for hours, because of an internal error that took place during pre-command update."
This evening this problem will be solved.
It's not true that this barrier came because of the attack because of the distribution of service [DD.O.S.].
On evening the online server trackers found that the NSA website was closed for at least six hours, and some users still have no site.
The spokesman for the NSA said to ABCS that the agency's inner, sensitive network had not even "behaved. "
Astronomer said, nobody is in danger of classified information.
At least one targetist group has claimed that they are responsible for tD.S. attacks by N.A.
The DD.O.S. attacks are designed in such a way that the target website is sent to traffic so large that the site is closed because the server overloads over.
It's relatively partial strategy and the purpose of attacks is not to distinguish the internal network of systems.
The former extremely mysterious n.A., ever named "No such agency," has become a subject of discussion and bitterness among the people over the past months by the events of foreign and domestic spying programs - all of which became part of a collective non-contributioned former ns.A.D.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.
Because of such increasing controversy about the agency, there was such an opinion after tonight's incident that it was the result of the action of the targeting operation.
50 feet out of the ground in a mine called a fireball team to save the ill puppy's mouth
Kackeran Ruby was fled after coming into a small street accident
He was seen by a dog Walker in a mine three days later
Fireballers took down part of the rock's front part to save the dog from the mouth of death
After 50 feet out of the ground, after being caught by puppy, he found a lucky life to be called by firemen.
The nine-year-old Coer fled after he came into a street accident on Sunday afternoon, and spent 3 days alone before he left the mine.
His employers were in a labor camp to meet again from Scott Adam Aderson, 25, and his girlfriend Beever's Hall, 20, Desanca, Ruby, and Rose, and they blessed the West Yorkshire fire and defense service.
After a little accident, he had searched like crazy dogs for his lost dog, and an appeal was sent to social networking sites.
On Wednesday, Wednesday at 2.15. A fast - eyed Dockkin Walker saw Ruby, from the ground on the mountain floor, at the height of 50 feet [50 m].
Claytenton came from fire station to a technical defense site and put down a rope to protect Ruby and used a tube to bring him down from the rock.
The expert technical defense officer Andrew Clayton said: "It was in a crisis situation."
It was between the side of the rock, up and down, 50 feet.
He didn't do one thing during rescue, that was a stone built.
But now she's good.
After that she was eating Bisititit.
It was a very unusual call for help.
It's incredible to see a dog.
Special technical defense officer Peter Lou said: "Abby is safely saved."
She had the possibility of being seriously injured or in worse position.
Ruby was taken to a animal doctor for testing, where she was found better than tired and thirsty.
Miss Hall from South Lansing, West Yorkshire said: "It was horrible to see our work."
At first I didn't believe how she got there.
It's awesome to get him back into his hands.
The animal doctor said that if he had been too tired and fell too low, he would certainly have fallen down.
The fireball team did a very great job.
What they did is really very courageous.
We are their sister-in-law, and they were all excellent.
"We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there."

Frotier Air Force director - on-on-Gurgeez
Frotber Airilles plan to pay $1100 for passengers on their plane board.
The Frontier is planning to start a charge for $100 in the air-on bag and pay $12 for coffee or soda, although the passengers can keep the entire box, although on Wednesday announce that the passengers can keep the entire box.
The new delivery - on - page fee is for the bag sealed in the bag, so, under the seat, the short bag will be returned.
Frontier said he'd charge $25 if paid in Adres, will wait $100 if passengers wait to pay while they're at the gate.
Fronter's spokesman Ket O'amley said that $100% of passengers have to get to care for the charge in Advenis.
"We don't want to charge him," he said.
Airnis started charge for the first and second test bag in 2008.
The passengers who are trying to avoid the fees are the ones who can do as much as they can in the delivery-on bag that is placed in an overheeded box, that means that this box often has a lower place.
Pay boarders have a way to reduce passengers.
O'Maley said it's not really about buying the new charge money.
It's for the most loyal clients about Frontier that finding out that overhed Bin's place has become increasingly difficult.
Airline doesn't have to give this to passengers who buy tickets in their website.
That means that the next person in line might give up 100 dollars for a similar bag, whereas a traveler on a front-line, on a front-line, can get a bag free.
O'Malesley said that the website and check operations of Frotier are being changed and that they know about fees before they get to the gate.
The new delivery fee for Frotier will not start up to summer though a date has not been set.
Travelers often reveal discontent about the bag owners and the other fees, but the plane service likes them.
They argue that the bagage spends money to handle, and those who want Travelers should pay for it.
The fees at Wall Street are watching as a sign that many airline loss have been paying enough money to cover the cost of air travel after the years.
Most don't even touch the pay - on-on-the-hand bag.
Spirt Aarlines Inc. The delivery - on -on fee began three years ago, and the partner Douger Sagner later.
With such a fee there's another Airline Airline Hugueri, who said Airline counselor J. Soensen, and who tracks e - on - on fees.
He said the delivery fee in SÃ£o Paulo brings $50 million to a year that was estimated in the December 2011 report.
A former official from Soensen, Brussels Airilles, reported recently flying in the Sparet and passengers have had to deal with the respirator - on - on - an unusual bag fee.
"Toboarding process that I saw in my Airline career," he said.
I expected to bite my teeth and look out at a battle gate.
"was full and he said it was litri-up."
Frontier is also following $2 fee for coffee, tea, Soda, or jus.
Frontier said that visitors who take Soda, or jusa, can keep the entire box, and it will give only once.
It will give away the water still.
Trying to charge for the drink in US Air strike times in 2008, but after the complaint of passengers, they turned back seven months later and no other key airline followed after they got there.
Frontier's passengers if they don't buy from Airline directly so this step of Frontier is his fresh attempt to conduct customers to his own website.
Airick payments online Trubitz for $10 to $25 sold every ticket.
That's why all Air Parkers have been encouraged to operate passengers to buy them straight out of an online polling agency.
Although Frontier, this area has gone forward.
In September often a number of flying miles began to give half to customers who bought from an online polling agency
On Wednesday it subtracted Myzzage for 25 percent of the trip mile.
So, a 1,000 miles of Frontier buys from an online Truck agency will earn 250 miles [250 km] away.
It also allows them to choose their seat in advance for the only passengers when they buy from the Frotier website.
Frontier has a loyal base of customers in his home city in Denver, but his business is going to decrease and it's losing money.
The 9 percent drop in revenue, and its flight is reduced by about 13 percent in the first quarter, at the highest rate in the Republic's Air Force Holding Air Forces, by Wednesday's continuing financial outcomes.
The Republic are trying to arrange the financial funds of Frober as part of the airline sales.

Scientists have further shed light on the connection between the dog's tail and his mood.
The last research shows that the happy dogs move their tail towards the right (from the left), while the anxious dogs move their tail mainly to the left.
But now scientists say that a dog can recognize this little difference and respond to it.
This study has been published in Patterson, New York.
The University of the University of St. Louis, a medical professor from trainto Georgia, explained: "It is all known among humans that the left and right parts of the brain are intermittently involved in the excitement that produces positive or negative emotions."
Here we've tried to see it in other races.
He said that dogs, like humans, had the right part of the brain responsible for the left hand and the opposite order, and that two unions played different roles in feelings.
To learn more about how dogs respond to an side-drop by other dogs, researchers have noticed animals looking at other dogs' films.
They calculated the tears of pet dogs and their behavior.
We probably won't think more about why their misery sometimes moves on the other side.
"We've treated dogs with movies - in realistic version or elsewhere that confuses them, and we could see the behavior of the tail and offer the tail more or more to the left or to the right."
When he saw a cold dog shaking his tail on his tail, they were at ease.
But when he looked at the tail changing direction to the left, their heart was stirred and they looked suspicious.
They don't think the dogs were deliberately talking to each other by means of these behaviors.
Instead, they think that dogs have learned from their own experience what they should be concerned about and who is not.
He said: "If you've met other dogs several times, and if they shake their tail on one side constantly, it's more friendly, and the right part offers less friendly treatment, you react to the same experience."
Researchers say that these conclusions can give employers, animals, and educators better information about the feelings of animals.
John Bradushau of the University of Bristol, specialist of the treatment of dogs, said that it is not the first study to check whether the dogs have left or right parts.
Last year, the team of the University of Linkan found that dogs turned their heads back to the left and looked at the happy dog.
In other research at the University of Victoria in Canada, he explained: "In contrast with the Italian study - when a robot dog's tail was moved to the left, the dogs were more likely to be worried than to get nervous."
He said that the difference was because dogs in different studies didn't understand every sense of animal or animal dogs in movies.
He explained that it could help to study ways of responding to the dogs.
"When there's plenty of evidence from various breast-bones that the two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more extensive information remains - and in this case dogs aren't exceptions," he said.
However, seeing how easy their behavior is to be recorded, it seems that we will probably not find more time to understand why their misery sometimes moves on the other side.
There's a new research to find out that we work with honesty and dedication in the morning.
Don't lie to anyone and don't steal or cheat.
But when evening comes, our mind is changed, and we keep the model one side against the law.
This research by David David Ales School of Business, University of Harvard University and Utteau, has given many interesting facts.
According to Researcher, despite the stress of work in the morning, we prefer moral values, but at evening we lose honesty because of fatigue or pressure.
Researchers used two uses for this.
He told some people to tell the number of dots on computer screen.
For example, people had to tell the point is more on the left or on the right.
The participants were told that if they answered the wrong answer instead of the right answer, they would be given money.
In this statement, it was seen that those on whom they were used in the morning between 8 and 12 did not make any mistake and answered correctly.
In the afternoon between 12 and 6 o'clock in the evening, people were found using the wrong thing when they deliberately ignored their principles.
It has managed to prove that greed for money does not affect our honesty in the morning, but when evening comes, we stop controlling morality.
It's published in the fresh issue of Science.

The new anti-virusion vaccine can end the joy of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-virusion vaccine, which can end the fun of smoking.
The same dose of vaccines, was able to protect rats from the addiction of scootine for all life.
Before a test is started on man, there is a need for a test that may take many years, but in New York professor of Velell Medical College said there are surprises.
Professor Cornel said that "we hope this kind of vaccine can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods available in the market today, but they found that their addiction is far more powerful than these current methods."
The new vaccine has a fatal virus, which has been prepared to provide genetic information for the cause of anti-virus anti-contributional anti-virus.
It infected the virus, selected in itself, which starts to form a permanent stream of antimediaids after that.
Antibidides search for any chemical molecules in the blood, preventing the discovery of nicotine within the smoker by trying to get them into the brain before they reach it.
In the trial, the vaccines who were later hypnotized kept doing their normal activities.
But the researchers say that the rat that wasn't given a vaccine "was good," it was a sign that nicotine had reached his brain.
This use was described in the journal Science Development.
The former tobacco vaccines had failed because they had anti-virus.
It contained regular doses to keep an anti-obidal level, but it proved expensive and unprejudicable.
But the cost of a new vaccine is expected to be too much, since the righteous cell will make it an anti-obidian factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before today's greed for tobacco can be saved.
But it's probably used to quit smoking by people who smoke.
He said, "They will find out that if they start smoking again, they will have no pleasure in smoking because of a vaccine that can help them break their habit.
British scientists reported the result to be interesting, but warned of the need to be very much research.

Trusted in the first president chosen freely in Egypt
Muhammad Mori has sworn by his office, but his conquest day may hardly end the political struggle in Egypt.
Islami MoreC promised "New Egypt" when ordered to replace the 16 months that had been removed before.
The fifth nation of Egypt has become independent of their formal installation court, the Morc Arab President of the world, and some 60 years since the overthrow of the Rajador, some 60 years ago.
In their seat they took an oath before the 18 judges of the court, which looked like the ancient Egyptian temple.
During the formal ceremony shown in the lively radio on national television, Morsi said, "We're looking for better futures, new Egypt and other republics."
A group of fanatics who since their establishment has served as an 84 - year illegal declared organization, and who has been on the target of the previous governments, said, "The people of Egypt today have laid the foundation for a new life - perfect freedom, true democracy, and stability."
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building, and soon after 11 o'clock in the morning, Moisi came into the car's squad, just after 11 o'clock in the morning.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to bless the president from the rank of the President from the time of Happytime, the traffic was stopped for a short while to get out of the road to keep his motor's eye busy, which unites the city's center with its South suburbs.
There was much increase in his triumph over the non-motherapy of the Bhud's non-mother's "Silit tire" in his personal conquest of Mori, and on Friday his talk presented him as not just a Muslimist but all who want to accomplish the mission against the hearing revolution.
The Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, swore before the judge sitting in the wooden panel next to the judge saying: "Today is Egypt's citizens, national, legal, and modern nation."
After that, the Morsi's university went where they had to give their diplomas.
The military band shouted national music for their official welcome, while they stood in a target of caution.
The military ruler was also known as marshal Husan Tilltov.
On their arrival, hundreds of people present at the main university welcomed the lecture room with the slogan "Sena and People are a hand."
The university was established as a base of secular education in 1972, later became the Muslim student class in the 1970's.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath in the book Skyer, which ended the dawning of the revolution, which made the previous year the tyrant rule of blessing, and swore to take back the President's office from his office, which was taken away from the military council last year.
But instead of consenting to the Supreme Court's official oath, they would bow down to the military's desire, which indicates the struggle for power would continue.
Morsi's speech in the book Szear was filled with dramatic public currency.

In 2011, the Caorbing Child Care Career, before being accused of being accused of being a helper of Jonathan Lord, has been subjected to sexual crimes committed by both employees in Y.M.B.
But in his statement to the commission, he said that it "never appeared to be a case of child sexual harassment within its organization."
The chief executive officer Philip Green was asked about the case in which one of the staff of Y.M. was accused of child pornography, and another case in which y.M.
Mr. Green said they knew about the first thing to help the commission, but they didn't know about other matters.
He also acknowledged that before the commission of Y.M.C.A., he said that "the external test of the commission was instituted in the form of Y.M.C.A. and he found that Baal is not even precise."
The commission is evidence that Y.M.A was warned, and it received a second minimum rating in the school quality in August this year.
Mr. Green, associated with Y.M.A, admitted that by appointing Lord, "the arrangement with me" failed, and failed to make sure that his employees were clearly aware of their duties to inform the hair security laws.
In the beginning of this year, Lord was guilty of sexual intercourse with 12 children during the two years of Y.M., two years ago.
He was punished for his minimum six years.
But Mr. Green refused to suggest that there was a cultural problem in Y.M.A, which made not a violation of child security by the owner.
The personnel who looked at the breach gave witnesses who spent time alone with their children, putting them privately by Lord, sitting in the bosom, telling them that he loves them and that he loves them on his mobile phone.
Daniel Okkwell, who was in charge of Lord's surveillance, and he had said for child security training, because he was concerned about his behavior, witnessing that Lord's eye was about y.M.
C.O. said that he didn't accept the testimony of the workers that they were not easy to give information from their schedule.
He said, "Rather, his friendship with Lord led them astray from their decision to tell about him."
Mr. Green said he had given his view to the Y.M.A.S. congregations that, from "JA Lord's Event" to the organization.
Mr. Green said that soon after the charges came out, the decision to sign confidential compromises by employees was made by Y.M.M.
He said that the purpose was to avoid the absence of the testimony, but it wasn't executed "existive" and properly.
Child sexual exploitation of children at the University of Griffithth, Special Professor St. Slugen Scibon, said that during the years between 2099 and 2011, there was not a safe organization.
He said that an appointment of employees, evidence, advance, training, and oversight were "expertable problems."
The hearing has been suspended until December 20.
The silver of Ponbros because of having felt hardship by the middle class in Singapore
In Singapore people in the Benemire shopping mall in Pesangarr are taking cash to pay their daughter's school fees, purses, and so on.
Mrs. Freethling said, "My husband and I bought a house recently, so all our money is involved in it."
She says, though, they earn 3,000 $400, U.S.S.), and their husbands work, but family income is insufficient.
In fact, this is the kind of demand in the parts of South Asia where domestic debt is increasing - Valdices where they are taking their own business became the third prairie on Singapore's Xinz this week.
The only way to obtain the cash is to keep the jewelry hostage - M. S. R., in case of U.S. R. S.
It usually takes 17% of interest in Singapore, which is only 15.4 percent more than the 15.4 percent of those who are distributed by the United States, which is the local lender who has branch in the shopping office.
However, Postenbros have the advantage of not being able to check the credit or pay evidence, and they can pay more quickly than the bank.
Because of the increased cost of living by families and the growing increase in domestic and user loans, millions in this area are turning to ponoby.
For five years after global financial disaster, and because of simple business policy in developed businesses, low income and middle - income families are trying to satisfy their needs.
This week the rating agency, Standards, blamed the growing domestic advantage of increased hostages because of increased mortgages.
It said in Asia that the highest domestic debt in Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore is the highest one in the proportion of domestic product.
Malaysian G.D. is on the highest level in this list, while it was 60 percent in 2008.
There are concern about the high standards of consumer debt in Thailand, which has been lightened by this week's technology delay.
On Thursday, data has shown continued export times and lack of demand.
In the Malaysian Bank, C.M.G., gesang Zongu Wun said, "The key point is that with increasing prices, people who come into the lower classes will attempt to increase their income in every possible way."
A historically high values in the values of gold in the past two years have moved people to keep personal possessions in pledge, because they are taking advantage of the opportunities to buy the jewelry of their family.
In Singapore there are 70 percent gold stored in a city-in-tralet of the city's 200 packet.
They're saying, "Cash's feeling good, let's have grandma's chain of gold hostages, and we'll take back the next month.
The biggest pierurist in Thailand, EGMAN, has seen 20 percent of the increase in the number of customers using their outlet in recent months.
There is so much increase in the business of keeping a hostage that out there are 15 others like it, not only in Bedymir and Singapore, planning to expand into Malaysia, in their neighborhood where its four shops are, but also out of Asia.
The company will support him, and Singapore will use 60 percent of Singapore's $5 percent of the dollars being spent in this week listing.
While some disks have been criticized for high interest rates, Ms Johns says that keeping a pledge is not only a cheap rate but also an obvious increase in debt.
They say, "The clients keep things they already have, and they don't add a home loan to personal hypnotism.
The social acceptance of Pebrobrocing to receive temporary and safe financial assistance is increasing.
It's not that Postenbros only use the vulnerable ones in financial terms.
Even rich people in Singapore use the Wall Streetlet, keeping Gold Times or Rances hostages, so they can buy 60 percent of cash for their purchase.
We come customers of all classes of society.
Ms. John says, "These rich persons include those who need a debt for commercial activities or investments, or small business that need to meet their cash requirements."
Sometimes they need money just in a short time.
They have bought in the capital vessels of gold and silver.
Such shopping has increased from 20 to 30 percent in the past year.
In Shimla, there was a turning point in Lingam's shops.
There was also a lot of mobs in dressing shops from the Lower market to the Malrode.
though in this year there was an expensive burden on such things, yet the people didn't yet appear stingy to buy goods.
Good morning for the purchase of Friday until 7:52 B.C.E., and 1:56 from 3:37 to 8:17 p.m.
At that time, more crowds of people with Shimla in the suburbs rose up for more responsibility.
So people didn't find a place to put foot in the Shimla Lore market.

Yet, they praised the government for their request immediately to respond to their request, which they brought to the prime minister at the beginning of May."
Mr. Wilkey said, "I hope the federal help package will be very helpful in the direction of separating the state state state state state health system from the crisis list."
According to the state government, these additional alternative processes are mainly going to reverse the recently cutoffs.
But the League's Federal Health spokesman Peter Ricton believes that today's announcement is "Band-AD solution."
He said to the A.B.C. T.V., "We're here because we're here because theber State government took 430 million dollars in his health system.
You can't accept as good news days to be taken by the state government for about half a billion dollars and given 300 million dollars by the nation.
Mr. HÃ¶rnton demanded that Mr. Compreque hand in case one of the rescue package wouldn't have been sold on a dollar plus bureaucracy.

The despair of Obama's votes
I voted twice over to Obama instead of changes.
He says that the policy of the GPPP has caused Obama's greatest efforts
The policy of the blockager website can't excuse drone attacks
The memory of 2008 Campen, who was of the past two years, reminds us of what could have happened
Neusanian P. Moris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I read very painful books today.
It's a book about which I think it will warm my heart the second year during the poison of the medical school, and give me hope.
It's the "Bellivation of the Year," and it's the release of the 2008 president's vote campaign.
When I spend the night with my patients and go to bed and this book takes me to a period in which politics inspired millions of people and could hold your breath.
Choice proved to be one side, and reports passed from time to time to show the historical significance of that time.
The eyes of my classmates were glad, and my father and my mother saved every news to come.
The young telescopes were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready to change.
He had 82 percent approval rating when he became the president of Obama in 2008.
And then I stopped the book.
The present truth is a hard truth, such as coming back from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a far remembering, a sad memory of lost opportunities.
There was actually a change through me for the first time when the vote went into action.
Simply put, no one could ever imagine it.
I thank Obama for a lot of accomplishments, from Aured Cove to the return of our army from Irak, "Don't ask me," until we're killed by the end of Oberama Bon.
Besides, I believe the policy of combating partial opposition has prevented many efforts to advance our country: including public options for health care, cleaning facilities at Guanajua Bay, besides others.
But a Number of times I took sides with my colleagues and colleagues in favor of the alien administration, and I've got the answer to what I could give them.
I've reached the point of political despair.
Republican's opposition is not the answer of the policy of foreign leaders, nor is the answer to drone attacks on innocent children in foreign lands.
The National Security agency cannot answer providing data about the personal life of American citizens or the government to blame those who reveal wrong behavior.
It can't tell the reason why the U.S. American citizens murdered Al Avilakey, nor of less public funding during President Campen's Camp.
It can't answer the conclusions of the report, which says that the attempt by the White House to silence Miiii by the White House has been "the most aggressive since the European administration."
And most recently it can't excuse the failure of a simple website to design a simplified website after it was signed by Aured Krex.
I don't know if I really expected it.
If, at the age of 18, I should have calculated that the regime could deny the political campaign that led to it.
It's obvious that the operating office is not a traditional route, since anti-conceptions and random events, such as the Newtown Baptist, will give shape to our public discussion.
Yet all the examples I've given up seem to have been chosen by the administration for themselves.
That bothers you most.
I emigrated in 2012 for Obama, but not because I was thrilled with his baptism.
The Romanre presented a dilemma and a uncertain option, which didn't appear to determine their policies or their positions.
I thought a second act for Obama, which would be free from the pressure of future elections, will fulfill the hopes we've been hearing for a long time.
Yet, when Obama's secondary ratings are less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return to 2008 by means of that publication.
I remember their promises for a long time.
This week was reading a portion of the book, described in detail how Cinton had a huge loss on account of Osinton in Pennsylvania.
At a post-mmy camp meeting he told his servants that they needed to return to the track, and be true to their purpose.
He said, "I want to get my Mos back."
We should remember who we are.
I can't agree with you anymore, Mr. President.
The ideas expressed in this comment are of Neusanian Moris.
The tracking group said that Syria destroyed its chemical weapon
The group that guards on Thursday said that Syria destroyed important equipment to produce chemical weapons and toxic gas, whereas fierce conflict in the northern part of Syria developed in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the location where there are powerful agents.
On Thursday, Cerian movement group said that nearly three years ago, almost 20,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in Syria.
This announcement of chemical weapon ban organization has been one day before the final date of November 1
It was determined to destroy or "constitutional" by the Hegnets Association for all chemical chemical production units and chemical gases that have been used to combine and fill the war-blower's content.
Mostly complete the initial phase of destruction is the fact that this ambitious event is a mark of some worthwhile miles of rock to destroy all chemical weapons of Adams by the middle of 2014.
To destroy devices means that Syria can no longer create new chemical weapons.
However, Adams still has to destroy the present weapon and collection.
Syria is thought to have 1,000 Metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mestard gas and Nantin.
The British situation has reported that the announcement reached Thursday as it increased the conflict in the city of Siraira, about which experts believe it is a chemical weapon production unit and the center of the building.
The movement group with its network in Syria told Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
He has said that 6,365 children including 61,067 public citizens.
The government has been told that 29,954 presidents are members of the military army of Asad, 18678 wagers for the government, and 187% are fanatics.
He also said that there are 2202 soldiers in the dead and about 5,375 fighting, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, U.S.News & World Report estimated that about 10,000 people have died in a struggle against March 2011.
It didn't update data since then.
Nearly two million people have been forced to leave the country because of this struggle.
As a result, the military force of Asd fought for several weeks against the rebels, many of whom were associated with Al-Copatra groups.
On Thursday, Observatory said that people on both sides were casualties, but clearly said nothing.
This describes the danger faced by fire, chemical weapons, which in a very short-ranged course, is the mission to complete the stylish weapons in Syria during the civil war.
Looking back to O.P.C.B.B.B.B.C.S. said that its team "is now content and it has confirmed -- and all the important production and mixing devices of Syria have been destroyed as well."
He also said, "No further oversight activity is planning."
At the beginning of this week, the supervisors said that he had gone to 21st of the 23 stations declared by Adams and completed the first phase of the mission.
The guards said they were not able to visit two centers for security reasons.
On Friday, O.P.C.E.. said that these two centers, according to Syria, have been "resisted and... brought the chemical product products stored there to other declared centers, which has been examined."
It wasn't immediately obvious that the unit in Sapphira is one of the two centers, or not, where the guards were not able to go.
Syria has offered a plan for the complete destruction of his chemical weapons, which is to be accepted by the executive committee of the next month O.P.C.
"I salute you for the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," said U.P.P.
For three years this civil war has been in the prime of history: the government of Asad and its security forces, which came out of Islam from Islam, including members of the Taitan sect, and the conflict between rebellious Muslim Muslims.
In other cases, Rambor Aborbori's chief Rambori said that Wednesday on Wednesday floor in the coastal region of Syria was an explosion of air travel center.
He doesn't know the reason for this explosion.

FAA: The airships can now use the compass (but can't call the cell phone)
Airplanes will be able to use their electronic devices to get through the entrance through the gate, to do things, play games, watch movies, listen to music - but not to speak to their cell phone -- it's under extremely advanced new direction through the federal administration.
But passengers shouldn't expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference, the administrator of F.A. said that the speed of these changes is used, it would be different in every airline.
Airlines will show FAA how their aircraft completes new direction systems, and how the rules of crew members are updated for training books and devices.
It's said that it's already achieved plans from some Airlines to expand the use of Portable electronic devices on the plane.
Delta and jet points are one of the airlines that have already laid out plans.
Says FAA in one statement: "On the basis of the situation, we can approve of extensive use of electronic devices very quickly.
In addition, passengers need to close their keyboard, tabloct, and other devices when the plane's door is shut.
They're expected to reach 10,000 feet of the plane and not start until the captain's permission is granted.
The passengers are expected to renovate their devices at the landing of the plane, and don't launch them until the plane is completely down.
FA.A. said, under the new direction, the Airlines under which the aircraft is safe enough to allow its passengers to fly by plane, at run-down time and during taxi calls.
Most of the new airline companies and other aircraft that have been modified in such a way that passengers can use YF in high altitudes are expected to meet these values.
The association of the project of the project of the project has welcomed these changes by the president of the project of the project.
The Glades said in a statement: "When policy is performed in a secure manner, and we'll work with airline companies to do so - it'll be a victory thing for both sides."
When this point comes, we've had a sense of humor like "Hal monitors."
The agency said, but the agency will still be banned using Internet access to less than 10,000 feet per hour, using email exchange, send or receive messages, or download data.

FAA can remove the ban on some electronic devices during the flight and landing.
Mark Rosen, director of the National Transport Security System last month, said that cell phone is still at risk.
"Cell phones are really serious issues, not just because they can potentially disrupt the navigationalized device, but also because they can create call Towers when in air."
To check out this point, the International Association of International Associations has recommended that the government should allow more than any private electronic device.

But the transmissions rise when downloading or sending data by the device.
There's also Amazon, of those who take sides with the passengers using the device.com.
In 2011 the authorities of the United States loaded their entire estate to Airlines and put it on trial for problems, but there was no such problem.
The FAA-A. counsel committee has expressed mixed sentiments about the danger to be used by the device.
They believe that the solution to the device is real, even if it's the risk of extinction.
Other members of the committee said that there are only pilot described in support of the removal of device in the Airsoft System, most of which are very old.
However, members of the committee insisted that FAA pilot be permitted to stop passengers when the plane was dropped in less-in-eparation.

Erbu lays a wide seat in this week's macaws, at least 18 inches (16 cm) in the Ekomymebin, but it should be determined by Erlines.
The debate occurs between 17 - 21, after the incident of the 17 - 21.
How has the last plane department been built - especially if Cing 9 or 10 is equal to the claims of more capacity - the design of Mini zto jets in view?

Airplane said he would take 350 people to 18 inches [9 cm] left in the seat, competition with A350.
The aircraft is often used by advertising in the business press to strike business matters on technical matters.
Now, air just with 777 X is expected to overtake more than 100 orders in Dubai, which is appeal to the public.

According to American Health Statistics, the relationship between American men in the 21st century is 397 inches, according to the 21st century.
Airbu says that his rival of 1950 is tied to a seat concept when the average difference between the new name set and the "jet" was about to be, according to Dr.
AirBus says they have established research techniques that suggest improvement in the quality of 50% of sleep in the width of the seat.
Bran had disputed the statistics of the air bus's seat measure, saying that it doesn't depend on the decision of a doctor to rent and provide.
Also, research shows that over the width of a seat depends on the experience of addition.

Kobin's ex-commodor expert Merob, the founder, and the editor's flight girl network said "ten inches would be very nice for passengers, but the fact is that this business point of AirBus is conducted by the threat of 777."
Air just and passing seats do not supply but provide a list to select from the cameras.

Should the mother be concerned, if in her daughter's 7 or 8 years of age, the development of breast - feeding and the raising of fetuses?
This week in Orlando, Florida, at the annual meeting of the American Medical School of Medicine, U.S.
Caploz says, "I spend a lot of time to convince the parents that this usually doesn't reflect rapid progress in the direction of full moon."
The obvious symptoms of growth, such as the sprouting of breast cancers, the hairy hair and the body smells from time to time.
But during the last four decades, there has been a very simple change in the age of R.I.
In the United States, average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in 1970.
"When the breast begins to develop, there are at least two to three years in the first century," says Caplojz, who is "time-time-time." The authors are also necessary to deal with this common problem.
The most precise test time for IV's development.
Wynn's beginning is disputed, but when breast development grows with breast development before 8 years of age, two call it "ball."
In most cases this procedure will slow down or stop - which child doctors can take a closer look.
In the process of more rapid progress, there may be a need to check through the fluctuations so that the chances of such serious problems as tumors or aist can be resolved.
The treatment is to delay the period-time monthly and other consequences: increase the age-old age-time of the bone, which can cause an increase in growth and growth as adults.
Careys for drug or Hermon treatment, child life, development rate, growth rate, and emotional adults depend on treatment.
Psychologists are also important.
We're on the underlying side of the problem, and we're going to find out what's going to happen. We're going to find out what's going on around us, but we're going to find out what's going to happen.
Another major problem can be considered: Parent doesn't just want his daughter to have menstruation.

Caplovics determine the law that its main cause is the wrath of obesity.
He had helped to conduct studies over 6 to 9 years of age in the year, adding the fat of the body to the discharge time.
Other results support the conclusion, but there are also many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispnic girls have the tendency to have sex before their age girls.
There's a lot of explanation of this.
On global levels, the representation of time-old, from economic conditions to climate and genetics, seems to be affected by all things.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting facial hair at an early age, women are not as clear as girls are.
Other physicians attending the AAP conference upheld the complexity of the subject.
Even in babies and children it has become common to be protected and seen as the hair of tellers.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the real beginning of the paradise," says Dr. Lawrence Silverman in Morristown, New York.
Parents should not hesitate to take guidance from their child doctor to find out how to talk to their children.
Caplojz advised, "The meaning could be to talk before expected time."
If you're quiet, your child will usually answer correctly.
Girls living before time need to be reassured that it's been long past but that it's part of normal life.

That was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36 - year - old writer of Motana, who was born with x. U.S. male quality, but his sancti is sick.
The physicians didn't clearly understand that his sex was short, or his business was big, but they were certain he could never live "normal life" as a man.
So in 1976, shortly after Bruce was born, Bruce was expelled by the outward organs and the Atkinkins, and he was raised like a girl.
She was given a female homon at 12 years of age.
She said to ABCnews.com, "I knew I'm not a girl."

George Kervin: Euron gave the choice to Scotts
Another Day, Another Story of Fear of Freedom
This time we're warned that freedom Scotland will need to join the independent journey zone throughout Europe as state of e.U.
The passport controls and points out stories about the limit on the walls of Bangon.
The truth is that the paper described the possible economic benefits of independence with the rest of Europe, although predictably it didn't describe it in the headlines.
Nor did anyone describe that most of their time spent trying to change their formal rules according to their own needs.
Since Scotland is no longer the Savga area, therefore Brasworth will always be easy to get whatever he wants from Scotland, instead of receiving anything from Scotland.
So, then, A-Sharnie.
And the thing trapped so long has grown, and first I meant "freeness" passport control was heard nearly 40 years ago.
Yet the interesting point was lost in again telling this fascinating old story.
Why should free Scotland expect Europe to pass through?
Why trading for Brandon, in London, especially now?
The real European news here is: The great, war-time scheme to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With Urn crisis, the project has officially been dead in Europe.
There are devoted teams strong to resist EU in all EU or to stop Euro as a currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosarian for the German Party - which has been established this year - suddenly received nearly five million votes in the federal election of September, thus effectively out of the Free Democrats (the equivalent of our Librems).
The planning to build federal Europe has always been domestic resistance.
However, the current economic crisis proved to be a natural changer.
In addition to the harsh rules imposed by Berlin and Europe's central bank, many are having to think that the project has gone far.
The vast budget of national governments did not have a huge role in the crisis of Euronique - it was only true in Greece's case.
Rather, the Euromon system has fixed its members in favor of German exporters to the exchange rate - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of a domestic currency waste, South Europe finds itself in a state of potential damage to productiveness compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce pay and public living - encouraged by Berlin.
Dark European producers far ahead of problems.
To release French and German energy firms on the computer of users - as a result of the "each" energy policies imposed by Braby, the European industry pays four times as double and four times as lightning to the UN.
It's the cost of Pinginging, which we've already seen in Legmouth.
Even in the world, it can't prevent the level of European calculus industry from being affected by expensive U.S. shell gas.
As a result, there is a spirit of rebellion, especially in France, who was once the principal fan of EU.
After U.S. war, France's top politicians had seen India control of the EU and Paris as a way to provide Billingings equal to Waldton in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs a passport for political validity, and it has applied its own financial policy on Europe, which causes France's economy to deteriorate.
The result: Mary Lenne's south square, E.U.A. National Front has recently won a victory at the third site.
The Front 24 percent is the most popular group in France at this time - this is a warning for British Lebber that they can't believe that it will always benefit the left, for the right.
What is Le Pen's doing with his new reputation between French lovers, working class?
This party uses e.U.A. choices that happen in the next year to be the E.U.A. to create an anti-constitutor group in the European Parliament.
If, as far as it is possible, the anti-opposing parties do well in these elections, this kind of party can first affect the European Parliament.
My view is this: Soon there will be an ex-conservative and the strongest anti-conception in Europe.
Euro won't complete, but it'll reach Europe like "Lord" in any way that will support General Dippie.
Germany and some of its economy can maintain Euronel, but France and southern Europe will re-enter their currency.
I hope the UK will keep himself away from this project in hopes of extending products with U.S.
However, the growing interest in Watishton in please indicates that Britain will be left in the cool Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all?
We can choose to be a region of little England (requiredly).
Or we can protect our own financial interests - including telling Berlin and 1952 to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better work in the private European system, if we keep our own currency.
It would be easier to work with other peoples in Europe, with similar thinking countries.
Otherwise we should consider maintaining our financial freedom by following the way of Norwe.
In Scotland, S.N.P. Government - generally referred to as the most successful military campaign in Europe, which won a lot of independence from Leber's Clerlerards (unsistent) protests and after that on the basis of the Torisher Debation year 2011.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for freedom at this time, because in that case, it would have to accept law of reproducing in Berlin and 1952.
So you used to think back on the previous century, thank the Internet?
Flight is moving forward to this pattern.
The company has increased the full year's advantage forecasting, and the record is expected to benefit from the Hallers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
It's expected that, in the full year before, it's about $5 million in between $30 million and 340 million in the last forecast, it was reported in between 30 million and 31 million.
If the goal is achieved according to the current guidance, the record received in 2011/12 will increase between 12 and 17 percent of the year.
The provision director Grandeler said that the flighter has benefited 8 percent in the first six quarters of the flight, and has started a good start in his second 6th, especially in Australia and U.S.A.
He said, "Our 10 countries are still in profits, and many countries are on the way to a complete year income from interest and contributions."
It includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are usually our most beneficial center.
The vacation business in second half in Australia has resurfaced the speed, which meets the loss of the weak domestic car market.
Likewise in U.K, the flight flight vacationer's vacation business did a good display, while Coratore's clients were selling less.
U.S. business had temporarily reduced its camels in its first 6th year, and it expected the third consecutive full year to be paid.
The flight recorder's share was with the sum of 3 cents yesterday, with 38.20 dollars.
The bird was left back in the forest by air transport for protection from North Sea

Is Europe's high class willing to work with Britain?
In April the business campaign was launched and Britain was promised to bring business together and determine what changes we want to see with UK workers and skilled manufacturer EU.
For that we held the biggest and most extensive survey of Britain's business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain's business with E.U.
UGavav designed for the idea of 1,000 businesses leading agents, representing Britain's commercial size, fields, and places.
This survey's conclusions can be amazing to many people.
We found that a large part of business workers now want to export out of Europe, and focus on those countries that are becoming modern and increase, while E.U.A.
They want the government to give priority to new business relationships with such countries as China, India, India, and Brazil, not to get involved in the process of reforming the mysterious organizations of E.U.
When they asked their opinion about specific policies such as product law, most traders believed that the control of these decisive qualifications should return to the Westmester.
It was very easy to find a single market, business workers say that the value of Brazil's content is much higher than the benefits of having a part in Europe's commercial field - so that large businesses that favor European companies that were traditionally favored European companies were 40 percent of the thing.
And most clearly, our survey of professional leadershipists found that, one large part obviously wants to go ahead with Britain, E.U. politics based on trade relationship and treaty change.
The conclusion, which was seen in the standards of the major business groups, showed that businesses are moved to a "valueless change," to give the UK his lost strength back.
It's a huge price - the issue of making peace changes for Britain and getting a better deal changed 16 percent on the side of B.U.S. to stay in favor of the treaty.
The prime minister shouldn't be in doubt: It's a survey that the British business workers advocate their plan to talk at the terms of Britain's membership in E.U.
It also showed that businesses, current powerness, expect to resurface a meaningful change in behalf of UK.
A better deal for British businesses is possible, and very fast it's going to be, because there's going to be moving forward in the direction of Eurojine, the economy, and the stateal union.
First priority must be jobs and increase in Britain, as the conclusion of our survey indicates, it means a new focus on business and a basic change in focus in theization of the land.

People might reason that the birth of Standey in New York City in America is the site of St.

This celebration, built and conducted by the founder of the St. Petersburg Institute of the St. Petersburg Institutes, gave mind this year its 10th anniversary, including more than sixty show in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these showed up in the headlinelines, and became great success, to a level where they became too large to play in the club."
We created this celebration as a way to continue working with them.
This year's program includes The New York Times, R.
In addition to the expansion of the celebration, the Comdida world has expanded.
Many of those who share in this year's celebration have come through media such as Comdy Sepic, F.X, and show on small network sites like Comrade Serbs.
Nick Kochil, a DC-Cable Comctcom (F.X.X.X. W. R. Rilnictball theme) arrived at a prominent location, and now their own self-combil's Computation is from the central Sky Show.

Moving along mud, rivers, and forests to provide medical care
Georges Wel, who live in rural areas in Cameroon, offers health care
Wel and his crew watch hundreds of patients on almost every weekend.
West African countries don't have much more medical; there's only a doctor for 5000 people
Give your votes here or use mobile
Dr. Georges Wels, in 2013, is one of the 10 heros in the top of C.N.
You can vote for them or for someone at other top 10.n.n. Year's hero.
The winning person will get $50,000 to continue his extraordinary job.
For 21 years, Georges Wel had seen his sick father coming to his senses and unconscious, going to the hospital, who had not been properly equipped to help him.
Geel Wel, in 1981, was injured in a car accident near Jadal, the capital of Cameroon.
He had only broken hands in the beginning, but an infection increased that spread to his brain, and he developed a blood clot, which affected his remaining life.
Georges Wel says, "There was no New Rosesgeon in Kuron."
If we had money, we would have taken our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, they went about with their father with a great multitude of clinics and hospitals, and received whatever help they might receive.
He said, "It's not easy."
You leave home at 5: 00 a.m. hoping you'll be the first person to reach the hospital, but it's not.
There are many sick ones.
Some can leap into death waiting.
The situation didn't change very much since Vel's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there's only one physician for every 5000 person in Cameroon.
If compared, there's a physician for every 413 persons in the United States.
If there are doctors there, even many of Cameroon's inhabitants can't afford it.
Two out of five live under the poor line in the country, and about two thirds of those working in health care in the country are private parts.
They say, "They have the only problem of poverty."
And being poor, they can't enjoy their lives.
When they saw the pain of their father, and of their own people, they determined to solve it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers last year have been a medical doctor.
They became medical themselves, and began working as such a surgeon in ValdÃ©nel.
And they started out with the non-Cald organization Akovom, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide professional medical services.
Since 2008, they and their own groups have helped some 33,000 people.
About Friday they sit in the van and about 30 people, lock medical supplies from the roof, and go to rural areas where people need medical attention.
Sometimes luck doesn't happen to them either.
They have to push the vehicle out of rivers and dust over once.
But when they reach, they really have the honor of the heros: the best residence offered by the feast, singing, dancing, and community.
These villages are actually the cause of the television medical service to celebrate, and Vel - along with their great smiles and endless energy - include joy and joy.
Next morning their team starts meeting hundreds of patients.
They said, "We're meeting 500 people each trip."
They come from village to about 60 mmys away, and they walk on.
All these weekends clinics provide various medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, heart disease, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can find a nested source, taxed source, or birthless evidence -- this document takes on school, but most poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening the crew arranges simple surgery with the synonymic noun.
Operations are usually done at school, Town Hall or Home; after procedure, sickness passes and leads to a relief site, and makes space for the next person.
The group's generator is published in the operating room and in the sanitizing devices, and Vel and their volunteers get up early on Sunday morning and work.
It's a blouse speed, but the village musicians usually help to inspire the crew.
They said, "They keep us awake and play the drum all night to continue their work."
On Sunday his party returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group - including the medical and foreign medical students in Cameroon - has 700 Hospital Liaison Committees last year, and they know that their help can change the world of those whom they help.
One person said that the patient would be able to go back to work again because she received medical treatment.
The man said, "The future of me and my family will be changed."
Besides running a weekend clinic and working as a doctor at the hospital, he also works on a personal medical clinic around Jadin at night.
He pointed out that it's their second job that costs 60% of their work; the rest's part is filled with personal contributions.
"I don't know when they're sleeping," said Cati O'Myley, a second - year medical student at Dryxley University in Philadelphia and a retired group of Welsley.
They're always at the hospital, or they're trying to make money for their organization, so that they can keep up with the campaign.
It is a practical opportunity for students like O'Mamaili who come from the United States and Europe to join the Weal campaign, which they will never have in their country.
O'Mellie said, "In the popular medical care we help to catch the tool for Dr. Welel, in which we're able to get a practical experience."
You will never have the opportunity to do that as a second - year medical student in America.
The volunteers usually live by themselves to reach Cameron, and they usually come with the medical supply of Dan.
But after they have reached it, they go and go, and they carry the expenses of the instructions.
O'Maley says, "No doubt they're hero."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help Cameroon's people will never end.
For Wel, almost the load of a kind of work, isn't it hard.
Helping others live happy lives, fulfill your promise to your father, these are the things that bring them great joy.
They say, "I'm very happy when I do this."
And I think of my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing it to make people laugh, lower their pain.

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February
The Vatican has announced on Thursday that Pope Francis II will first make the Catholic Church a new cardinal on February 22.
Cardinals, the highest class in the Catholic Church, have priests, whose office is above only the pope, and these choose the pope, so Francis will cooperate with the first group of his men, who will eventually support their successor.
Now there are total 201 cardinals.
Similarly, after reaching 80 years of age, Cardinal would not have been allowed to share in the pope's election - it comes into the group of 120 "cardivor."
In a speech announcing the news, the Vatican's spokesman Sir Fasbo Lobard said that before the ceremony of the new cardinals was instituted, all the existing cardinals would be held to the meeting, which is called the Pope's Day.
Lombardi said, " Francis has already decided to report his decision to hold the popeship of February, in order to make it easier to plan another meeting shared by various countries of the world.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Vesez said that by February there was a chance to reduce the number of cardinal elections.
In general, the popes announce the names of the cardinals, less than 120 of them, and more than 80 years of age.
Valerro said that it would be important for the next year, since this year it would be the first pope meeting in March after Francis was selected.
Currently there's a nature of prejudice toward Europe and Italy.
He said, "It will be interesting to see what the new popes do even more than the rest of the world to replace balance.
In South America there are 40 percent Roman Catholics, but in Cardinals they have very little number.
Francis's Cardinals Council - a group of eight cardinals from all over the world - whose work is to seek reform methods of the Church, these are the first cardinals to be selected after they have been chosen.
Before the pope decided all things himself.
Well, ValÃ©ro said, "now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help himself."
He's going to ask for such advice from Francis Cardinals.
But we're not in this situation before-- it's absolutely new.
Valerro said that the popes generally assign cardinals of large places, but Francis was "subcently surprised - so we don't know whose name they will declare.
457 slaves on theja can pass through the trial "promisity"

Today a government discussion was issued, the former Leber M.P. McPynic said this could provoke neighboring countries in Australia, condemning government terms of foreign employees.
