RBS necessitated two forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has necessitated two traders from its foreign currency exchange department, the notice from the case received information from two people, the other indication that the currency is moving forward at a global test-of-the-scenes speed that is carried out by legislators in relation to the market.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and RBS, have confirmed that they are collaborating with legislators in the investigation in which the largest financial market in which there is a delivery of $5.3 trillion each day.
These two traders will be the first employees of the RBS, who have been necessitated with the investigation of the case that appears to be a repeat of the Libor interbank debt hierarchy Kand.
The bank has confirmed, refusing to comment about Nilamban, that the bank has received a request for information from legislators this month.
Two weeks ago the bank said, "Our investigation into this case is ongoing, and we are fully collaborating with the FCA and other legislators."
Last month, noticeers from the case had said that the RBS sent to the former Trader and that the archives of email and swift messages received from them have sent to the UK legislative, financial conduct authority.
This trader named Richard Yousher left RBS in the year 2010, and is believed to have been made a holiday from its current position of head of Forex Spot Trading in J.P.Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading in the city, had gone on leave last week, while the former senior Karancy Trader in Barclay and UBS was nominated by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
The advertisers from the case stated that Ms. Yousher's quick message group includes the bankers of Barclays and Sitigroup.
UBS said that, after being told by the Swiss legislator, Finma that she is investigating the related hierarchy of the foreign currency market in many Swiss backs this week, she has taken action against some of her employees.
At least six authorizations at the global level - the European affiliate, Finma, Switzerland's Competition Authority of Vico, FCA, the Department of Justice in the UFC, and Hong Maritime Authority - are investigating allegations of being durabled to get their respective downturns into the currency market on the bankers.
People familiar with the case stated that, HSBC, Citigroup, J.P.Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted internal investigations, or received requests for information from legislators.
Banks are investigating a quick message and email as many years as they look for a misdemeanor signal.
News about the investigation, in the area's traders, who have been among the leading individuals who have been among the most profitable in the trading unit of investment banks for the past several years, but they are facing the challenge this year, as there has been a reduction in opportunities for satires due to low downturns in Karensize.
Some bankers tried to suppress the case by saying that it is impossible to hierarchize into the very large and highly liquidated foreign currency exchange market, but the senior traders say that it is not true that is true.
The senior trader said that the liquidity between the different trading platforms, despite the enormous magnitude of foreign currency-sale and the increased use of its own platform by banks means "You can start to impact the market at a slightly lower ticket value."
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced to Trader from its Exchenz Traded Funds desk in London this week, which lost nearly a million last year.
The bank immediately notified consistent sanctions and is collaborating with its legislators.
Credit Suisce said "We believe the trader had acted alone, and has been controlled."

Mr. Ray also claims that all agree with what is set out to the layout of Bangladesh's development led by Prime Minister Mamti Bergi.
Leaders of other groups including Congress, Makpa, Bhakpa, and Farward Blake are moving on to join the Triennial Congress.
Welcome to the Triennial of any party's eligible leaders.
The division of the Tribunal on the Palika Board is being considered important in political halves due to the change of the group of congressional parishes in the Sanithia municipality before the election of five municipalities that took place on November 22.
Its first left-wing governed Haldia and Nadia is also an example of the capture of the truce on the Congressional governed Palika Board.
When the group is occupied by the change on the municipal board in the districts, those who join the party are grandly welcome to the Kolkata-based triumvirate house.

How can we stop them when they're getting information from the police and others.
Earlier Asaram's lawyer accused the media of showing news by growing up about them.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
Let them enter the case against which they would enter against, but the back was not affected by these arguments and refused to interfere in the case, saying that they had more options.
Even before, once the court has rejected Asaram's request to stop on media coverage.
A study has been announced by the British government for an increase in the benefits of Scotland from the HS2 rail project.
Works by HS2 indicate high speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will soon begin with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer stated that "Britain will be one from this project."
Scotland's Transport Minister Keath Brown said that they are very "excited" by working with the British government on this project.
The first phase would include the new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When the second stage is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government revised the cost of building a high speed link between London and North England by £2.6 billion by £2.6 billion.
The British government, which was talking to Scotland Transport, instructed HS2 Limited to consider further potential for rail capacity and travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of making possible travel time three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
According to Baroness Kramer: "Our goal for HS2 is the real national network, which will bring close to the UK and its cities."
We're moving on with HS2, because its benefits will be much higher.
Without this, we will deal with problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 cities in Britain, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be further connected due to HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Ellistair Carlykel: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keath Brown appealed to Mr. Carlyon to the HS2 network of Scotland's "clear" return.
Mr Brown stated: "The high-speed rail is likely to have heavy economic benefits to Scotland, but this will also increase economic burden on the whole of Britain's high-speed rail throughout the UK.
So we are excited to act in the participation of the British government, so that we can examine options to bring high speed rails to Scotland, to create profits for all, and to complete the Glasgow-Edinberg line, the Scottish government of which the Scottish is already planning.
I am quick to review the investigation report with the British government ministers next year and to decide together on further action.
Mr. Hindu justice will make the Huantha text with Sri Hanuman Vida, the national president of the anti-terrorist front, Manindrat Singh Bitta, with the 10 thousand children, who is held in Dana Mandi, close to Jalandhar Bypass on 23 November.

The Supreme Court refused to stop media reporting.
The Supreme Court said he could not tell the media not to report on information he received from the police or any other source.
Asaram's lawyer said that Asaram was being called Drakula in this case.
The guide for reporting in this case is Lines but is not being followed.
On this, the Supreme Court said that you have many more treatments in such a way that can be used.
Asaram's lawyer said there are thousands of news papers and 100 news channels across the country, but there are two channels that have more trouble with them.
These people are damming their image and reporting a lot of things.
In this case, Asaram's right must be protected.
The court prohibited the media from preventing reporting, but told Asaram's lawyer that they had other legal treatments he could use.
Black box in your car?
While the streets planner of the United States, struggling with the lack of funds to improve the devastated Highway system, that is where many people are looking at its solution in the small black box, which is fitted with the clearance of your car.
This device, which tracks every mile driven by the motor-conductor and transmits that information to officials, has today become a controversial issue for the Washington and State Planning Office to fund the U.S. major roads.
In general, the work, such as highway planning, has also suddenly become an issue of deep debate and lively associations.
The mills you drive by, and possibly the drive-of-the--- and then use of this information to prepare tax bills - have met with Liberatorian environmental groups to raise support in order to allow the government to use these black boxes.
The Tea Party is a bourgeoisie.
The U.S. Civil Freedom Association is also very concerned with raising a variety of privacy issues.
While Congress could not agree whether to take further action or not, many states are not waiting.
They are looking for how they can go to a system in the next decade in which the driver pay for each mile set on the street.
Thousands of motor-walkers have already taken black boxes for test drives, some of which have G.P.S. monitoring.
It's really essential thing for our country.
"It's not the subject of being elected or not elected by us," it is to say of Hassan Ikrata who is the executive director of the Southern California Government Association, which is planning to start tracking every mile set by motor-walkers in California by the year 2025.
There's going to be changes in our way of tax being paid.
It's technology to do that.
The main reason for this being is that the country's Highway Trust Fund has almost been decommissioned, funded by U.S. citizens from the payment of taxes being made at gas pump.
The American people no longer buy as much gas as before.
Now the car runs more miles than ever in a gallon gas.
There was no increase in the last 20 years in the Federal Tax, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Because of the high value of gas, politicians also avoid increasing a money in taxation.
Transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota, Lee Munich, says, "Gas is not tax at all constituent."
Their state has recently placed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
They say, "In the period of time it will serve as the most rational option."
Wanks calls it myelage-based user fees.
It is not surprising that this idea seems good to urban liberals, because this can, for example, change taxes to change as car driving, which can help reduce jam reduction and reduce greenhouse gas.
California planners are keen for this system while they are developing strategies to meet the target set out in the state's Majority Global Warming Laws.
But the Chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip. Bill Schuster (a.-P.A.) also considers the black box to be the most behavioral long-term option.
Free vendors at the Regeneration Foundation are also in favour of payment per mile by the driver.
The vice president of the policy in the regeneration, Professor Moor, said, "It's not just a tax that's going into the blind well."
People are more directly paying for what they're getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. Transport Secretaries, who had favored moving from Congress to the direction of per-mile payment in their report in 2011.
The U.S. Senate had approved a $90-million-dollar test project last year, which would have included 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural regime-makers, who were representing individuals who have to walk too many miles to go to or go to the city, Saddam's leadership ended that offer there.
Yet many states and cities themselves are moving forward in this direction.
It has the most wanted oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the largest use in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the myelage fee instead of gasging the state.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
The city of New York is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is testing with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 alliance, including the 17 State Transport Departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), are studying how they can make this change.
This idea did not get support in all places.
In Nevada, where this device was put on cars of 50 voluntary car drivers a short time ago, the drivers were very impatient to think that the government could monitor each of their steps.
Alauddin Khan, who directed strategic and work-definition management in the Nevada Transport Department, says "Big Brother and other things like the same was the main problem."
It's not something people wanted.
As well as the investigation's advance, Nevada's A.C.L.U. had warned on its website: "It would be quite easy to convert these devices into a full tracking device."
There is no need to develop a vast, irreconial technological framework-structure, which must have to spread as a result of each person's record of coming-of-age.
Nevada is among the many states that he is making every effort to obtain the heavier technology, with the help of which the state can get details of how many miles of car is running daily, but not where and where it is going.
Khan said that if you could do that, people could feel more easy.
The search for this technology brought some state agencies to the small California start-up called True Milez.
This firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was attempting to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which drivers were to pay based on their myelage.
But the device it is testing the Highway planners was well, as it does not use G.P.S. and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by modem at certain times.
Rayan Morrison, chief executive of True Milege, said, "If you don't track people's speed and their place, they'll be more willing to adopt this way."
These early programs of the state have had some major mistakes.
There are also very few cost-effective and low-intervention ways to do so.
In Oregon, planners are using giving different options to drivers.
They can choose a device of G.P.S. or without a G.P.S. device.
Or no device can choose to take, but may choose to be fixed based on average miles to be set by residents of the state.
Other places hope that this abolition can be sold to concerned citizens by providing more convenience rather than less in the device.
In New York City, transport officials are attempting to develop a taxing device, which will also have the provision to pay the parking meter fee, provide "pay according to its drive" insurance, and other drivers will create a collection of real-time data from which motor-walkers will be able to avoid motor-walkers.
The city planning document mentions, "Motor-conductors will be attracted to it because of the benefits it has received from it."
However, some transport planners wonder that perhaps according to the mile, all discussion on payment is great.
The Metropolitan Transport Fund in the San Franisco Bay Area has said that Congress can deal very easily with the problem of the Divian Highway Trust fund by increasing gas tax.
The drivers of hybrids or other cars can also be placed on additional one-time or annual fees, whose vehicles do not use much gas so that they pay their dues.
The director of the statement and public affairs of the agency, Randy Rentseller, said, "What is needed for him when work can be worked from Espirit."
If we do, millions of car drivers will be concerned for their privacy and a lot of other things.
Awakening Bureau, Srinagar: Former Minister Ghulam Hassan Khan's security involved in Congress from the People's Democratic Party has reportedly been removed by police.
Khan held the state government responsible for this, saying that their security has been removed for political reasons.
Be learned that on the ticket of the year PDP from Shopies, the slave Hassan Free Muhammad Seed, who won the election in 2002, was among his ministry while he was the Chief Minister.
Ghulam Hassan Khan said I've just received a security coat of arms since 1996.
I live in the shoopies called the fort of terrors.
A security squad of CRPFs at my home was all deployed to the inspector's office.
There are adventures with me, but all my safety was suddenly returned to Virwar.
When the security squad was leaving my house, I talked to the district superintendent and district SP.
But instead of restoring security, they just said he'd investigate the matter.
However, when contacted by IGP Abdul Gani Mir of Kashmir in this context, he denied the case information that it was a sensitive matter.
I myself will examine how the security of a former minister and senior Siasi leader has finally been removed.
From the provincial congress chief Prof. Saifudin Soz, he said that there is nothing like that in my information.
It's a very serious thing if agreed with Hassan Khan's security.
I'm in Jammu right now, I'm coming to Kashmir in the next one day.
I will discuss this issue with the relevant administration.

C.D.C. issued children's allergic-related guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines for controlling children's food allergic to the school.
Such guidelines have been first issued by the U.S. government, as the number of children going to school is increasing suffering from food allergic.
Now one out of 20 children in the U.S. has food allergic to each.
C.D.C. found that between the years 1997 and 2007 there has been an 18 percent increase in food allergic cases in children.
This guidelines inform schools about how teachers and staff are notified of children's food allergic, and how to handle it in a state of having an allergic response.
Schools have also been suggested to have the stock of epinphreine to cope with potentially life-threatening acute acute (anaphylaxis) - which is the auto-injector of the APen Brand which is most commonly used.
The state referendum has recently updated in regulations, allowing schools to easily hold a greater amount of appenphrain stock.
This report also includes a list of general symptoms being transmitted by children suffering from allergic response.
Children might say "It seems something is bounced in my tongue," "It looks like my tongue is hair on", or "is being zunished in my tongue."
Flight electric equipment regulations will now remain effective in Australia
Bowzdu, Australian airmen of the move to be smoothed into equipment related regulations in the US, must continue to close their tablets and smartphones when flying and landing aircraft.
The US federal aviation administration has left the option open to American airborne service companies to change their processes, so that passengers will be able to read, video viewing, or play their equipment during the important stages of flight, provided the device "Keep in mode"
Passengers can do so during a lot of flights right now, but many people don't think it's good to be able to reach their e-books when they fly and get to their e-book when they planed.
Australian air service companies are considering this decision, according to which US air service companies will have to do much more work to meet this need, but they have pointed out that they have no immediate plan to make changes in their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said that she is considering the announcement, but insisted that the restrictions on electrical equipment are still effective in important stages of flight in Australia.
"At present the CASA, there is no specific regulation governing the uuse of electrical equipment in the aircraft," the authority said, "The issue comes within regulations, according to which aircraft service operations companies must ensure that the security system has always been fully, and passengers must comply with the security instructions given by crew members."
The Virgin who is already communicating with the CASA about expanding the use of its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system is willing to follow this change, but she asked to take further action on the legislature's directive.
The spokesman said "We will welcome a review by the CASA in case we are allowed to use electrical equipment, because we really think it will give customers better experience, because we now have (virless in-light) aircraft ours.
Quantas said it would comply with the current rules right now.
It said that "the electrical devices cannot be used while flying and landing aircraft according to our current policy, and we have no immediate plan to transform it."
FAA decisions, apply to U.S. allerlines.
By the way, we are always interested in legislative developments that can benefit passengers and we will certainly consider FA's decisions and the reasons behind it.
The effect of this decision, each US air service will vary on the company and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Airing service companies will need to verify that their aircraft can tolerate radio drilling from mobile devices, as well as they must make modifications to their rule books, training materials, on-gauge programs and passengers in short detail.
The FAA said that "after the authentication of their aircraft's endurance by airlines he would allow passengers to hand over all heights, electrical equipment of light weight such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones to use."
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will direct passengers to close their equipment while landing the plane.
The group has also suggested keeping heavy equipment under or holding heavy equipment in a safe way while flying and landing in the upper room.
The electoral 42 senior leaders of the region's brigades made their strong appearances on the air.
It is notable that Modi has come on a morning tour for a condolences trip organised by the brigade.
The arrangement of the consoul journey is a quay of putting the parasites of those killed in the blasts in the pantheon.
It is notable that there were a total of seven riots after one during the Hunkar rally of Narendra Modi on 27 October in Patna.
During the Indian mujahidean's threats in the blasts, the people were involved in the rainy rally, so that there were more people and there was a terrible atmosphere in the region.
That threat did not succeed, but six people were killed in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the brigade.
The leaders of the party have emerged on the trip since Thursday, taking the bone-clash from their village.
On November five, the bones of all of them will be flowd together in the Ganges in the pantheon.
The part of the same journey is the arrangement of comfort travel.
Its main antagonists are Narendra Modi.
They will go to the village of people killed in the blasts from Saturday morning and meet their neighbors.
During this visit, they will also provide a check of five or five dollars to the strangers of the dead.
The announcement of this financial aid has already been made by the brigade.
The defendants would clear up and netted in the name of the share's purchase-for-profit by referring to the trading firm.
Probably there has been millions of dollars of fraud in such an openness for the first time in the region.
Who is the gang's sergeant, the police have not yet reached him, but seven people, including the accused who saw him in the region, have been taken into custody by police.
This group operated a written comet market under the name Metaterader-5.
The company's actors would take cash from investors and make written IDs on a written software.
This would see the purchase of investors' purchasers when they were trading.
It would even find out which price the share was purchased.
In fact, no shares were purchased, nor did there be any transcription for it, as no demet account of the investors was opened and shares were false on this software.
Police are saying that hundreds of people have arrived in the gang.
Each investor was invested for two and five million dollars in the name of money.
Its chief accused Amit Soni has been taken into custody by Cyber Cell from Jodhpur, while six of his other companions have been caught from the inn.
According to ADG Cyber Cell Ashok Double, any share trading company is required to connect to the Stock Exchange as a trading firm.
Only then can the company make investors share trading by itself.
Then the investor's demet account is opened, so that shares can be bought for him, but this company named Metetrader-5 was neither connected to any exchange nor stock trading.
This company had purchased the server for itself by referring to the transaction on September 24, 2012, under the name Wintrade.
Since then, people have been being swiveled in the name of investment through this company.
There have currently been eight of Indore's commercials who complain in the Cyber Cell.
Their money was not transferred to the account even after they had sold their purchased shares in the money.
On this they began asking for money from the company's actors.
Investigators are even saying that the price of their purchased shares was always lower on the written ID they were given.
This price defendants would set at their level.
The company has appointed its CEOs and agents in Rajasthan, Mpr and Maharashtra.
The agents advised people to join this company by giving people a desire for more money.
Then two million dollars were collected from someone for five million dollars.
Foreign Minister John Kerry unexpectedly admitted that in some cases the U.S. spy has crossed the border.
Also they claimed that innocent people have not been promulgated under the secret surveillance program.
This confession of Kerry came in during addressing the annual summit of the Open Government Partnership held in London through video links.
Kerry said, "I assure you that innocent people are not getting involved in this process."
But inappropriate ways have been taken in some cases in an attempt to obtain information.
Meanwhile, an important committee of the U.S. Parliament has approved a legislature limiting oversight activities of the National Security Agency [NSA].
Its purpose is to make surveillance more transparent and restore the belief in people that have been hurt by the revelation of a large-scale phone tape.
The Senate's move to Google, including six American companies, have welcomed.
The NSA has also deployed in data centers of these companies.
The Senate's Prover Committee passed the Foreign Secret Supervisory Reform legislature [FISA] on Friday with 4 votes against 11.
This legislature mentions a number of restrictions including restricting a unanimous phone tape under the U.S. Patriot Act.
Under the FISA, his use will be considered a crime by deliberately collecting data and sentenced to ten years in prison for this.
It will become legislative law after both the Congress's sediments of the House of Representatives and the Senate are approached.
Chairman of the committee and Senator Dianne Fén Schin said that the NSA's program is under law and that I believe it has made significant contributions to the country's security.
But despite this, further transparency should be brought into it.
Moreover, the protection of the privacy of the public should be taken care of.
Meanwhile, upset Google, Yahoo, MicroGPS, Apple, AOL and Facebook have supported this legislature, outraged by the NSA's Internet surveillance program being exposed.
In a letter to the Senators, these companies have said that we welcome this proposal of troops who issue on recording large-scale phones of the NSA.
It is noteworthy that the curtain removed from NSA's actions from documents released by former CIA employee Edward Snowden.
There is a particular outrage in the international community after the NSA's investigation of the talks made on the telephone of 35 countries nationwide, including Germany and France.
In an unexpected confession, John Kerry said that the U.S. spy "is gone too far ahead"
John Kerry pointed out the U.S.'s protective attitude on his surveillance program by accepting the unexpected form that sometimes its spying "unregablely goes far ahead."
The Minister of State has also admitted that they are also guilty of being "the pilot" in case of being "the pilot" towards Mukhbir Edward Snowden about the disappearance of N.S.A.'s spy regimes.
This mystery has brought diplomatic relations with the U.S. government in connection with its coalition countries.
Speaking through video links at the Free Government Conference in London, Mr Kerry said: "There is no question that the President, me and other people in the government, were really aware of what things that were happening to the automatic pilot, because look back, see if World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War, and then, its capacity in exactly the 9/11.
They have become the first high-ranking members of the U.S. government, who have admitted that the U.S. spy has taken its limits, but has insisted that no one's rights were abused.
He said that: "In some cases, it has gone too far inaccessious."
And the president is determined to try to explain this for the people and are currently in-depth review so that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you that nothing is going wrong with the people who are involved in this process.
Mr Kerry stressed that, however, the N.S. was striving for good purpose, and its surveillance work has saved many people's lives.
He further stated that: "We are facing a world where people are willing to blow themselves up."
There is violent extremism in the world, which is committed to blowing them up and attacking governments.
So what's the trouble if you're able to stop it before it happens?
We've saved the plane from actually falling, destroying buildings, and killing people because we're already able to know about the plan of others.
During this time, on Thursday, the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee of European Affairs said that the U.S. legislators would go to Europe to help address concerns abroad about the so-called U.S. spy, and that European countries would seek to explain the need to continue corruption-solving efforts in conjunction with the U.S..
Senator Chris Murphy of Contecht said that he has spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week, and that they are concerned about the threat of being stopped in anti-terrorism organizations because of their surveillance by the National Security Agency.
The Democrat Party's first elected and the Senate of the European Affairs Foreign Relations Subcommittee, Murphy, in testimony to Washington, said, "It's really important for U.S. national security interests to be with our countries in terms of our terrorism-fighting efforts to be with us."
To make it clear to European countries that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the N.S. program.
News of recording Europe's millions of phone conversations by the N.S.A. has brought bitterness in connection with some of the U.S.'s collaborative countries, although the head of agency said these reports are not entirely correct, and shows the misunderstanding of the metadata being shared with the United Nations, which co-operative nations.
Other leaks in documents leaked by Snowden indicate that N.S.A. has done telephone monitors of 34 other top leaders in the world, including German Chancellor Agenla Mercal.
National Secret Director James Clapper defended the incident of spying on cooperative countries, stating it was necessary to do so by both sides.
Among Hangame, Murphy said his office was arranging for a congressional trip that is likely to take place this year, and he hoped that the delegation would include both groups and members of the Chambers.
The names of other method-makers who are involved will be released in the coming days.
He said the travel program is still being worked on.
While Murphy said that the purpose of the trip is to improve relations, he said that some "trevice relations" must also be abandoned.
He said European leaders would also have to be honest with their people, for years of their spy programs used.
Murphy said, "While we can amend our surveillance program to better protect European people's rights, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying."
During this time, there is a program to go to Mr. Carey's Middle East and Poland, where they will settle the U.S. from the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran.
N.S.A. charged "sexual error" instead of hackers to crash the website
The mysterious National Security Agencies said on Friday that some technical deficiory had led to our website closed for a few hours, not because of hackers as some people claimed online.
The secret agency said in a timely sent email, "The night was not in reach for several hours at the NSA.gov, which was due to the error that occurred during the predetermined update."
Today evening this problem will be solved.
It is not true that this obstacle, the distribution denial of service [D.D.O.S.] came due to the attack.
In the evening, online server trackers had found that N.S.A.'s website was closed for at least six hours, and the site is still not in reach for some users.
The spokesperson for the N.S.A. told A.B.C. News that "with the internal, sensitive network of agencies "had not understood."
The spokesman said that no classified information is in danger.
At least one hacktivist group has claimed online that they are responsible for forcing N.S.A.'s website by the D.D.O.S. attack.
The D.D.O.S. attack is designed in such a way that traffic is sent so much on the target website until the site is closed due to the server overload.
This cyber strategy is expected to be unrecognizable, and the purpose of the attacks is not to hide the internal network of the target system.
The former highly mysterious N.S.A., who was once named "no such agency", much more such in the past months has led to the presence of events of foreign and domestic spy programs among the common people - which collectively discontinued former N.S. contractor Edward Snowden took place after the secret N.S. files being stolen from Agenci and mystery.
Because of the growing controversy about the agency as such, after this night incident was such that, the incident was the result of the targeted cyber operation.
In a mine, a fireshamck crew were called to save a lost pup on the mouth of the critical mountain, 50 feet above the ground
Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after a small road collision
He was seen by a dog Walker trapped in the mine three days later
Fireshamck workers landed the front part of the rock from the rope to protect the dog from the mouth of death
After somehow being trapped on the mouth of the critical mountain 50 feet above the ground by the pap, it was fortunate by the call of fireshamk workers.
The nine-month-old Cocker Spanil Ruby, on Sunday afternoon, had fled after a road collision, and was sold alone days before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
His owner Scott Elderson, 25, and his girlfriend Beckey Hall, 20, Denhom, were in the Flapit Mine in Pashmichi Yorkshore, and have thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After a short accident he had fled after he had been searching for madmen like his lost dog, and was posted on social networking sites.
On Wednesday at 2.15 p.m., a fast-looking dock Walker saw Ruby, on the mountain 50 feet above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Kleckheton Fire Station arrived at the scene and landed by rope to save Ruby and used a stomach to bring it down from the rock.
Expert technical defense officer Dry Clayton said: ‘She was in a critical situation.
She was in the middle of the front side of the rock, 50 feet above and below.
He did not do a single thing during the rescue, she had been stone.
But now he's good.
She was then eating biskit.
It was a call for a totally unusual help.
Rather, it's incredible to see the dog.
Special Technical Rescue Officer Peter Law said: "Ruby has survived in a fortunate way."
He was likely to be seriously hurt or even worse.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for the investigation, where he was found to be good in addition to recovery and decommissioning.
Miss Hall from Hallifax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was terrible to see the Bachav task"
At first, I didn't believe how she got over there.
It's hard to get him back in his hands.
The veterinarian said that if she were too tired and fell, of course it would have fallen down.
The Fireshamck crew did a great job.
What they did is really a very bold job.
We're their ahs, and they were all the best.
Mr. Elderson from Kighley also said: "We were afraid she could fall, but she remained there."
The Fireshamck crew did a great job.
I don't believe how she got over there.
That caused the protesters to take trouble.
Speaking to the meeting held on this occasion, Bar Association president Ramesh Singh Negi expressed a strong cry on the anti-Semitic law system in the region.
He said that the rapid attacks on sanctions and their parasites prove that the perpetrators are going to be unemployed.
There has been no fear of police and administrative system on them.
He recently referred to such events that took place in different places, saying that when the presidential society is not safe, the general man's security can be easily justified.
Frontier Airlines Carey - On Bagage's fee
There are plans to charge $100 for passengers on their flight board at Frontier Airlines to store goods Carey - On.
There are plans to start a charge for a Carey - On Bag at Fortherly Airlines for $100 and it will, for coffee or soda, although on Wednesday its announcement that passengers could keep the entire box.
The new Carey - On fee overhead bin for the bag, so, little bag under the seat will still be suffoted:
Frontier said that $5 will charge if paid in Evans, $100 must wait if passengers wait to pay until they are at the gate.
Formerier spokesman Kate O'Mally said $100 fees are to be obtained to care for the charge in passengers' auctions.
"We don't want him to charge," he said.
Airlines began charge for the first and second check bags in 2008.
Passengers who are trying to avoid shells are filling as much as they can do in Carrie - on bagage that is in the overhead box, it often means less space in this box.
There's a way to bring less for passengers on the fee board.
O'Mally said it's not really about raising new charge money.
It's for the most loyal customers about the frontier that the overhead bin has become increasingly difficult to replace.
Passengers who buy tickets in their website of the airline do not have to give this.
That means that the reason the next person in the line might have to pay $100 for a similar bag, while a passenger at a frontier gate, a bag can get a free one.
O'Mally said that the frontier's website and the processes of the check in these are being changed before passengers get the gate know about the fee to ensure that.
The new Carey - On fee of the Frontier, will not start until the summer even though a date is not set.
Passengers often show disregard about bagage fees and other fees, but aircraft service likes them.
They argue that the bagage costs money to handle, and that those who want passenger service should pay for it.
The fees of bagage at Wall Street are seeing as many as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover air travel costs after years of loss.
Most don't even touch Carrie - On bag shells.
Spirit Officer Inc. Carrie - On-sulture started three years ago for the first time, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later.
As well as one such fee, the other airline is Hungery's Wizz Air, which airline consultant J Sorensen said, and who tracks Aid - on fees.
He said that Fiti's Carey - On-Shul brings $50 million a year that was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former official at Midwest Airlines, recently flew into the spirit and passengers have suffered a carry - on unusual bag fee at the gate.
"The strengthening process that I saw in my airline career was easy," he said.
I hoped to look out at a toothbrush and a battle gate.
"Wiman was full and he said it climbed lick much-split."
Frontier is also following $2 of $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice for yoke.
The frontier said that passengers who take soda, or juice can keep the whole box, and that free coffee will only give for once.
It'll give off the water yet.
US Airways briefed in 2008 to attempt to charge for beverage, but after passengers complained they withdrew seven months later and any other airline followed to be there.
Passengers of Frontier's if they don't buy directly from the airline then Carrie - On to charge the fee this step of the frontier is your own effort to operate your own website to the customers.
Airlines pays online travel salesr to Orz for a ticket each of the $10s such.
That's why all Airlines has been an incentive to operate passengers to purchase directly from those people instead of going through an online travel agency.
Frontier, though, has gone ahead in this area.
In September many often flew miles from half to customers who had purchased from an online travel agency from these individuals
On Wednesday, it reduced the Mileage Award by 25 percent of Trip Mile.
So, an 1000-mile frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency will deploy 250 miles away.
It is also that they allow their seat to be chosen in advance for the only passengers when they buy directly from the frontier website.
Denver, Frontier has a loyal base of customers in his home town, but its business is declining and it's losing money.
The 9 percent drop in royalties and its flight capacity has decreased by about 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the ongoing financial results by Corporate Parter Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic airlines are trying to set portfolio finance as part of the sale.

It said it had decided to "put an administrative sentence by abolishing the reporter's license of "Chen Yongjau."
It had "had instructed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a full improvement of the New Express, to investigate those responsible for it in the New Express and to immediately modify the leadership team of the New Express."
Ms. Chen wrote in New Express, a number of articles blaming financial irregularities in a relocation-up company called Jumloyan.
After being dismissed, his newspaper published two newspaper appeals for their release, and said that he supported Mr. Chen's journalism.
But after that, Mr. Chen admitted to come to state television, writing and publishing false stories for money.
He told state broadcaster C.C.T.V. that "In this case, I have damaged the Jumloyan as well as the whole news Miouia industry and its ability to win people's faith."
I did it's mostly because I had a greed for money and fame.
I've had my mistakes.
After Mr. Chen's pardon, the New Express issued a felony pardon, stating that it had failed to properly investigate their report.
Recently, a lot of high-profile related individuals have committed TV. broadcast fault-sweeping.
Experts say that time-consuming guilt-sulicity is made, despite the fact that a law in late this year prohibited authorities from forcing a person to blame himself.

In the newsrecy-based retreat, the devotees are still coming to the same as the first retreat and see Asaram.
Scientists have highlighted further highlight the subject of what is the relationship between dog tails and its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs move their dome more to the right (from a dog point of view), while the restless dogs move their tail mostly more to the left.
But now scientists say that fellow dogs can recognize this subtle secret of the tail and respond to it.
This study has been published in the Journal Carint Biology.
Professor Georgia Vellartigara, neurosynist professor from the University of Treto, stated: "In men all this is well aware that the left and right parts of the brain are differently involved in the excitement that produces positive or negative feelings."
Here we have also tried to see it in other races.
He stated that even in dogs like humans, the right part of the brain was responsible for the left arm and the opposite order, and that two fingers played different roles in different emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to a dum being shaken by other dogs, the investigators looked at other dogs' look at animals.
They measured the hearts of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We probably won't take much time to understand why their dome ever moves on the other side.
Prof. Velertigaura stated: "We presented dogs with dogs movies - in shadow-image pictures to deal with other issues that put into or confused in the realistic version, and we could see the tail's action and offer the tail more left or right."
When the animals saw a sentimental dog moving their tails (from a dog's point of view) they remained perfectly comfortable.
But when they saw the tail changing the tail to the left (from the dog's point of view) their hearts increased, and they would look restless.
According to Prof. Vellartigagra, they don't think dogs were deliberately communicating to each other through these rumors.
Instead, they think dogs have learned from their experience of what they should be concerned about and not on whom.
He said: "If you've met other dogs many times, and if they constantly move their tail on one side it's related to more friendly behavior, and right part offers less friendly behavior, you react to the same experience."
Researchers say these findings can provide better information on animals to owners, animal doctors, and trainers.
John Breedshaw, a guest professor of the School of Veterary Sciences at the University of Bristol, a guest expert on the behavior of dogs, stated that it is not the first study to examine whether the left or right part is important for the dogs.
Last year the University of Link's team found that when dogs look at an offensive dog, they turn their heads to the left and roll their heads to the right when you see the happy dog.
In other research at the University of Victoria in Canada, he stated: "In contrast to the Italian study - when the robot dog tail was rolled to the left to the left, it was more likely to get closer to dogs than to be restless."
He said that these gaps were because dogs in dog movies in various studies were not fully sluxed.
He explained that it could help a study of the way they react to real dogs by dogs.
"While different mammals have found considerable evidence that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information still remains - and there are no exceptions in this case," they said.
While the ease that their behavior can be recorded seems to us probably doesn't take longer to understand why their dum ever moves on the other side.
The new research has shown that we work with full honesty and dedication in the morning.
It doesn't mind like lying to anyone, and steal or cheating.
But as soon as evening, our minds change and we put the ideal on one side of the rule.
Researchers have given many interesting facts in this research of Harvard University and the David Aclus School of Business of YouTube.
According to researchers, we prefer moral values, not having a stress of work in the morning, but in the evening, there is a decline of honesty by more fatigue or more fatigue.
Researchers made two uses for this.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell whether the point was more on the left or on the right.
Participants were told that if they responded incorrectly instead of the correct answer, they would be given money.
This experiment saw people who were used between 8 and 12 in the morning made no mistake and answered correctly.
It was found that when using people between 12 and 6 p.m. in the afternoon, that they deliberately answered them with their principles on the watch.
This managed to prove that in the morning, money greed doesn't matter to our honesty, but we stop giving up morality as soon as evening.
This research has been published in the fresh issue of Psychological Science.

Callson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
The former editor-in-common of the News of the World, Andrew Colson, has been accused of using "phone hacking, monitoring and amenities" in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret information about their systems at the time of Charles Clark's stay.
Prosecutor Andrew Eddy Q.C. told Old Balley that the News of The World had heard a misdemeanor rumor in May 2005 that Clark was meeting his "accompanied special advisor" Hanah Paulby.
The court said that the newspaper appointed private investigator Glenn Landyer to hack Paulby's voicemail and that male "keeping the nazar", but also called and left his voicemail.
Mr. Eddys said that "the allegedly party suggests that Mr. Colson who is currently the editor of N.O.T.D. does not go to stand outside the people's house and go to look at them, but he has articles to people, see what people react to him."
They said N.O.T.D. used three methods to investigate the cases: phone hacking, monitoring, and amna-samna.
The third one included the editor himself.
It's obvious that he knew other ways, of course, about the Nazis, he certainly knew.
What about the first one?
Did he know of the phone hacking?
He says, no, we say "Yes, he totally knew."
The rumor about Clark's systemic constituents was first presented by the feature desk at A.O.T.D., when a source of sexually willing in the U.S. Paulby said: "Don't waste your time, he's with Charles."
In August 2006, a tape of voicemel was seized from home from the landowner, at least three times from the phone of the U.S. Paulby.
The investigators also found entries in the private investigator's computer, on which were named "Project" to Paulby and his sister.
At the time in which they were being examined, they were asked to call them anonymously to Paulby's grandparents.
During this time, former chief reporter Nevili Thakrlbeck and former reporter James Schwarup saw the supervision of the arrival of Professor Paulby.
On June 18, 2005, Colson through a voicemail, said to them: "I've got a story, which we're planning to run tomorrow, of which I definitely want to do Charles."
Mr. Edis said that the involvement of Colson in this case, is only in a parton with other important individuals, such as former Home Secretary David Blanket.
The judge heard Thursday that, Colson spoke to Ms. Blanket about the systemic relations with a married woman, while at the time he was seeing the case of co-rebechae Brooks who were married at the time.
Colson & Brooks refused to ill-fated with others to hack the phone between 3 October 200 and August 9, 2006.
Lander, Turlfbek, and Swarup have accepted phone hacking.
The Indian team excited by the inaugural win in the previous match on Saturday when the seventh and final wild against Australia at M Chinnaswamy Stadium, it will have to take over the series with the goal.
India had to win any recent Nagpur Forest Forests to remain in the Sierra after rain was washed due to rain and his batsmen gave him a record by showing him, making the series a 2-2 equaliser.
In the series, Team India has twice achieved a goal of over 350 runs twice and once again the team's Naya will only be on the batsmen's responsibility to put a pass.
The Indian bat is at the extreme at this time, and the greatest goal is also proving to be bun in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Head Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Khatani are in strong form, but the team will also be particularly expected from Yuva Singh, Suresh Rana and Ravindra Jadeja.
As far as opening is concerned, Rohit and as head the team has found a salaried pair that is making easier to the rest of the batsmen from the solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur he had given Virat a chance to play without any pressure, sharing brilliantly in the opening.
The third number is being considered to be the true tenure of the future by what Kohli has so far performed.
Rather, many cricket pundits have made them better than true.
The next week, going to be 25 years old, has been a Virat 17 wild century of which India has won in 16.
They have an average of over 80.00 following the goal and he has emerged as the best Finnischir.
India's top three batsmen are in strong form, but these three can also be vulnerable to the highly dependent team.
Rana and Yuvraj had been badly flopped in the previous match.
Yuvraj has not even been able to open an account in two matches in the series.
In such a way, good parity can work 'lifeline' in the Benglur forest for them.
As far as Australia is concerned, her batsmen especially Captain George Belle has impressed everyone with his performance.
They are also raising demands to be taken to the Test team for the home Ashes Series against England.
Australia has good batsmen up to ninth.
In addition to Belle, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Vogues, and James Fokner have made good tackles in the series.
Although Phil Hyunge and Aron Finch have left no impact in the opening.
Michelle Johnson's lack of racing may be heavy to Australia.
Johnson, who performed brilliantly so far in the series, has been sent to the country for the preparations of the Ashes Series.

It's right that we can't work without wealth.
Wealth for life yapping is one of the greatest needs, but it's not in our interests to assume everything.
We celebrate the Krishna trio of Karthik Mas.
Richteras is worshipped by Kuber, the god of wealth, and the death god of Yamaj.
There is an important place of wealth in our religion and life.
No wealth is good-bye.
Good-bye is our feeling for wealth.
There can be no more valuable than the wealth that came to the good of mankind, but that which is the cause of pride is no meaning.
Let us earn wealth for holy purpose, and for the holy purpose.
It is the duty of everyone to spend the whole of the family's feeding.
Some of it must also have a sense of practice on society, but the tendency to impose endless or yen-can-type wealth destroys our conscience, personality.
The sense of donation should always be in mind.
A portion of the wealth you give can also become the basis for someone's life yapping.
We should all think for them why many people are living in terrible disadvantages in society.
In fact, the males of life have equal importance to meaning, religion, work, and liberation.
All the people desire wealth and success, and according to their men they have wealth and success.
The same wealth-saving is sustainable with which respect is associated.
No matter how rich a criminal may be, he can neither properly enjoy it, nor can anyone else have the work.
Let no one else have wealth, let him not offer it.
The true rich is he who made the way to flow in the numerous hands of wealth.
There can be no more wealth than the creation of jobs for others.
Another thing, wealth isn't just as a coin.
It would also be as a love for your health, character, others.
Try to be the master of this same wealth.

The STF has been involved in the roll number of 700 students in the investigation.
About 125 of these students had taken an Admission to medical colleges.
Admissions of these students can now be abolished.
After the STF's openness, the Department of Medical Education has begun mantra to abolish the entry of these students.
According to information, the department is looking to meet with a list of all these related students from the STF.
The list will be sent to the occupation to cancel the merits of the students involved.
However in this case the department is also saying to take legal advice.
Departmental officials say students entering the year 2012 have been a year, so legal advice is required in this case.
The cases are not in a position to say anything by being limited to the STEF investigation.

New anti-nicotine vaccine can end the joy of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can end the disease that meets smoking.
The same dose of the vaccine, the mice, was able to protect the mice from the addiction of necessitation for the whole life.
Further further and testing are required before testing is started on man, which may take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Vel Cornelette Medical College in New York said that the anarchist signals are positive.
Professor Cornell said that "We are very hopeful that this type of vaccine strategy can ultimately help millions of smokers, who have tried to quit using all the methods present in the market in today's time, but they found that their addiction to addiction, is far more powerful than these existing methods."
The new vaccine has a lossless virus, prepared to bring genetic information for the purpose of creating anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus, selectly infecting the cell, which then begins to form a permanent current of antibodies.
Antibodyes search for any molecular molecule in the blood, and prevents them from looking for smoke inside the smokeer by expiring before they get into the brain.
In the test, vaccines that were later given fossils continued to do their usual activities.
Researchers say that but the rat that was not given the vaccine seemed "good", it was a sign that the virus had reached its brain.
This use, was described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Former tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibody.
It had to be dose on a regular basis, so that the level of the spherologists, but it turned out to be expensive and untreatable.
But the price of the new vaccine is being much expected, as the morphological cell will make the antibody's factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the human vaccine of the future remained fully safe, it could be given to children, before the cigarette may be tempted, to protect them from addiction.
But it will probably be used by individuals smoking to quit smoking.
He said, "They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy smoking because of the vaccine that can help them to get their habit.
British scientists reported the result was interesting, but warned of the need to be researched much more.

When a crowd of experts who performed horses were gathered for the best horse of the year in Cardiff they knew it would be challenging competition.
But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not yet went to school, and a few months away from taking his first step, this young child and his pet Shetland's Ttu Tuffy easily completed three steps and received the top prize - he left his 30 adult friends behind.
In the annual competition organised by the Sunnyback Equestrian Center in Rudri, near Cardiff, the pair that cannot be separated - which is the only length of the Sk - was highly praised for the show, behavior, and style.
In front of men and women wearing beautiful baller hats he knocked her flat hat on the aloud angle and wheeled her two-year-old Toffey around the ring.
The decision-makers praised Fenton for their natural skills that are far beyond his age.
And Tofi received the highest points for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was given the last March as a gift on Tofi his third birth day, and he has since practiced with this pseudonym of Rosanna Shetland.
Her 30-year-old mother, Donna, said: "Fenton and Toffey are the great couple."
They had faced challenge from all expectations, but they both won the Gold Cup and Rosetate.
It was just the second occasion, when he had participated in some competition with Toffey, and we're all very happy at his victory.
The most different in this colorful, he all felt so wonderful that they wanted to draw photos with him.
This young child of the village of Nantiglolo, close to Ab Well, South Wales, is walking on the footsteps of his wife Sharon Howells who have been performing horses for over 10 years.
Mr. Schremt Howles said: "The whole place was full of enthusiasm, and everyone was celebrating happiness and playing the tali."
He was racing on Balu throughout the colorland, and despite so little appearance he did extraordinary work.
Fenton is the madness of animals - he is very fond of horses, tractors, and farm, and he has two carrots he care for.
The kind of the way he's started will be in the best horse show of the year long ago - and I trust he will perform very well.
The spokesperson for the annual horse exhibition said: "Fenton's age is just three years, but he comes to control his tuition."
They're very good couples.
Decisions gave scores, in view of the way Fenton and Tofi's performance and their presentation in the show ring.
He saw good team work between Tiftu and his rider - in this case Fenan and Toffey were the best in the ring.
I fully believe that Fenton's dear clothes have helped him, he was looking very different.

Faith in the first president elected independently in Egypt
Mohammad Morsi has taken the oath of his post, but his victory day may be able to end political conflict in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammad Morsi, 16 months ago, "Icera" when swearing to the position as the first independently incumbent President of the country to replace Hosani Mubarak, who took the place of the removed Hosani Mubarak.
On his formal installation before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi Arab has become the fifth President of Egypt after the world's independently deputed First Islamist President, and about 60 years ago the monarchy was removed.
They took an oath on their chair to the 18 judges with black labades of the court on the banks of the Nile, which looked like the ancient Egyptian temple.
During the formal ceremony shown in the live broadcast on national television, Morsi said "We are expecting a better future, new Egypt, and another republic."
The anti-abortion group Muslim Brotherhood, which has served as an illegal declared organization 84 years since its establishment since its establishment, and which has been on the verge of previous governments, 60-year-old Morsi, trained in the party's U.S., said that "the Egyptian people have laid the foundation of new life - complete freedom, true democracy and stability."
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen secured the building, and according to local time, cars came to the small Kafile a short time after 11 a.m.
From Mubarak's era to give Mubarakbad to the new president aside from the president's smoke from the time of the president, only a few hundred supporters gathered the torture were also stopped for a short time, so that their motor would get out of the street that was normally occupied, connecting the city's center to its southern suburb.
The non-Karishmai of Brotherhood grew greatly after their victory in Morsi's personal reputation being mocked as "seriously tires", and on Friday their speech presented them not just as an Islamist but all candidates of all who want to carry out the work of the Revolution against Mubarak.
Morsi, dressed blue business suit and a red tie, took the position before the judges sitting in the wooden panel Chamber, saying "Today, Egypt is a national, constitutional, and modern nation."
He then moved to Morsi Kairo University, where they were to give their opening speech.
The military band played national tunes and was officially welcomed, while they stood in the currency of caution.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was also present.
Upon their arrival, hundreds of people attending the lecture room there at the main university welcomed with the slogan that "Sena and the people are a hand."
Founded in 1908 as the fort of religious education, Kyro University later became the stronghold of Islamist student groups in the years 1970.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath in the U.S. Squir, which is the place of that uprising, which ended the Mubarak dictator regime last year, and took the oath of taking back the presidential takeovers by the military council from the last year to the military council.
But by agreeing to take an official oath to the court rather than by customally taking an able oath of parliament they bow to the will of the army, which is a sign that the struggle will continue for power.
Morsi's speech in the U.S. Squire was filled with dramatic popular currencies.

British police sent repercussion notices to Assange
British police sent a retrial notice to Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, who has taken refuge in the embassy of Equidor in London and requested for asylum.
Scotland Yard said he has sent a "autsance notice" to 40-year-old Australian Assange, for which they would have to attend the police station, as well as saying that he himself would be responsible for being arrested when he failed to do so.
Assange is facing repercussions in the wake of sexual offences charges in the wake of the charges, as well as their options within British law ended at the time while the Supreme Court rejected their appeal against the remuneration of this month.
Stockholm will hand them over to the U.S., with fear they had requested a refuge in the embassy of Equidor in London, saying to the South American country for political asylum, on 19 June.

He's in violation of the terms of his deposition.
The embassy refused to comment about being given police notices.
Assange fears that due to the release of more than 250,000 U.S. state-politic cables on a privacy-resistant website called WikiLeaks, the United States will be repatriated from the United States to face possible spy allegations.

Charge of sexual offences at two employees of the Y.M.C.A. prior to charges against Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission heard
Before being charged against Carringbah child care worker Jonathan Lack in 2011, two employees of the Y.M.C.A.S.D. have been charged with child crimes.
But in his statement to the agency, it said that it "never had a case of child sexual harassment within its organization", it was told to the agency.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Green was asked about the case, which accused a worker of child pornography crimes of the Y.M.C.A.A., and another case in which the Y.M.C.A. Caringbah Jim Immunist was charged with child sex crimes against children living in his care in the year 1991.
From the president, Gael Farness, who assisted the agency, said they were aware of the first case, but they were not aware of the other case.
He also admitted that the statement of the Y.M.C.A. to the agency that "the external investigation of the "YY.M.C.A. has been conducted and that they have found the Y.M.C.A. ahead of the child safety" is not accurate.
It is testimony before the agency that the Y.M.C.A. was notified, and in August of this year, the Department of Education and Community of Quality Audit received a second lower rating in the four possible ratings.
Mr. Green who is associated with the age of 21 years old with Y.M.C.A. admitted that the reason why Lord appoints "self-ident even mine" had failed, and failed to ensure that workers were clearly aware of their duties relating to informing child safety policy violations.
At the beginning of this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences with 12 children during a two-year term in the Y.M.C.A.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of six years.
However, Ms. Green refused the suggestion that there was a cultural problem in the Y.M.C.A., which caused workers not to notice child safety violations by Lord.
What workers saw about the breach, gave witnesses in which to spend time alone with children by Lord, to get them privately babysiting, to say to them, "He loves them and to give them to his mobile play."
Daniel Oakwell, who was in Lord's supervision, and he had said for child safety training, because she was concerned with her behavior, testified that the Y.M.C.A. Carringbah service manager of Lord was "very difficult and difficult to find most times".
C.E.O. said that he did not accept the staff's testimony that they were not easy to inform above their provision.
She said that, rather, their friendship with Lord misled their decision to inform him.
Mr. Greene said he had provided his view to the Y.M.C.A. N.S.BLU. congregation that, the text "about not giving notice" to the organization from "Jonathan Lord's event".
Mr. Greene said that the decision to sign a privacy agreement by the workers soon after the charge was made by the staff, the child service of Y.M.C.A., was made by Mahapriyman Lly Whiteley.
He said that its purpose was to avoid the combination of the witness, but it was not "extremely" and properly executed.
The University of Griffith's Child Sexual Explosion Special Professor Stephen Smalbon said that Y.M.C.A.N.S.D. was not a safe organization while living on the work of Jonathan Lord between 2099 and 2011.
He said that there were "gainte problems" in the appointment, deployment, entry, training and monitoring of workers.
The hearing has been postponed to December 20.
The silver of the Ponbrokers due to the difficulty being felt by the middle class in Singapore
Janani Amirthlinga at the Ponshaop at the Bendmier Shop Center in Singapore in Singapore is taking cash by giving her gold chute, rings and zumke to pay her daughter's school fees.
Mrs. Amirthlinga said, "My husband and I have recently bought the house, so all our money is trapped in it."
They say that, although they earn $3,000 in Singapore (2,400 U.S. dollars) as Edmonton, and her husband also does jobs, the family's income remains insufficient.
In fact, parts of Southeast Asia have similar demand - where domestic debt is increasing - Valumax where they are doing their own, became the third pop to be listed on Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
It is not the only way to buy cash - 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of the arbitrary richthlinga - but also as cheap as the unsafe bank loon.
In general, Ponbrokers in Singapore take 17 percent per year interest, slightly more than 15.4 percent offered by the United Overseas Bank, which is the local lender whose own shopping center is in the same center.
However, Ponbrokers have the advantage of not requiring proof of credit or pay, and they can make more loans available than the bank.
Millions of people in this area are turning off the ponshop due to the increased costs of life-saving by families and the difficulty of facing difficulty in domestic and consumer debt.
After five years of global financial disaster strong growth, and simple mortuary policy in developed economic systems due to cheap credit, lower and middle-income families are turning down to meet their needs due to their economy's decline.
This week's rating agency, Standards Eng Puers, largely reported the increased domestic profits due to increased hostage (mortgage) as a risk factor for the debt of Asian banks.
It said that in Asia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt in proportion to the gross domestic product.
Malaysia is ranked highest on this list with 80 percent of GDP, while in 2008 it was 60 percent.
Economists are concerned about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has risen lightly from technology drilling this week.
On Thursday, data has shown a reduction in ongoing export revenue and consumer demand.
In the Malaysian Bank, C.I.M.B., economist Song Seng Wun said, "The exclusive point is that with rising prices, people coming from [i.e. scale] to the lower class will try to increase their income in every kind of way."
In the last two years, historically high values in gold values have led people to keep personal assets intact, as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to extinguish the value of their families's decorations.
In Singapore, there are 70 percent of the items placed in the City-State's 200 Pon outlet of gold.
People are saying, "The sense of gold looks good, let's keep the mother's gold chain, and take it back next month.
Thailand's largest ponshop, Ejimani, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its outlet in recent months.
There is so much increase in the business of holding the market that the outlets in Bendymir are planning to expand in Valumax and 15 others like it in Singapore, not only in their neighborhood, where there are four shops, but also outside Asia, the executive director of Valu Max, Yah Lee Ching.
The company will use 60 percent of the $66 million Singaporean dollar received in the listing this week on Singapore Stock Exchenz.
While high interest rates have led to criticism of some discontinuous Lenders (negatives), Baháʼí Jah says that holding the stake not only does not only get a fair rate compared to other lenders, but it does not even directly increase debt.
They say, "Grabors hold items that they already have, and it doesn't increase domestic debt to personal assets."
The social acceptance of Ponbroking is increasing to obtain short-term & safe financial aid.
It's not like only the Ponbrokers use financially weak people.
Rich individuals in Singapore also use the Valumax outlet; they hold gold bars or rollex rumors that can pay up to 60 percent of their value.
We have customers of all classes of society.
Professor Yah says, "The researchers include wealthy persons who need a loan for a short time for professional activity or investment, or small businesses that need to meet their cash flow requirements."
Sometimes they just need wealth in a very short time.
From the capital on the rich, there have been good purchases of gold and silver.
Such purchases have increased from 20 to 30 percent, compared to the past year.
In the grocery stores in Shimla, the lounges were putting up a humour.
A lot of crowds were also seen in grocery stores from the market to Malrod.
Although such goods were taking place this year, people still did not appear to be reluctant to buy at the good Muhurt.
On Friday, the good seal for purchase lasted from 7:52 a.m. to 10:12 a.m. and 1:56 to 3:37 p.m. & 6:17 p.m. to 8:12 p.m.
At the time of the three Muhurt, more crowds of people flocked to purchase more in the suburbs, including Shimla.
In the Shimla Monarchy market, people didn't get a place to get to foot.
The crowd in every small big store likewise remained.
In such a case, when there are signs of the shopping good lighthouse on the rich that is manned as the trio of the Krishna side of Karthik Mas.
According to information, Virwar was heading to a urban Willo nursery called Habibulla Malla in Haritara-Sopor.
Suddenly a bear attacked him.
He made noises for help while resisting the bear.
By the time people arrived at the outside to help him, the bear had eaten his face badly.
The people made noises of stones on the bear.
On this he hid in the nursery except Habibulla.
The villagers brought the injured Habibulla to the hospital for treatment.
A $325 million bailout package for Tagi's health
The federal government has insisted that there are also harsh conditions associated with a $325 million bailout package for the health system that will ensure that the state government cannot waste.
The Federal Health Minister, Professor Plibersek, has announced that the National Assembly, the old-in-the island is "tacting" to address the current crisis due to the state's old-in-the-population population, the high rate of chronic diseases, and the system's boundaries.
The decision to fund-raised to be done over the four years, was followed by the government's consultation with Tasmania's independent Sanskrit Wilky.
Professor Plibersek said today, "The government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we believe will address the particular challenges facing by the state.
The $325 million package also includes an alternative $31 million surgery scheme.
2,600 additional operations, including Orthopadic and Motibind surgery, will help to address the previous assembled cases.
It also includes Wake-in clinics in Hobart and Ionsettion, better care after going from hospital, training of medical experts, mental health services, and personal electronic health systems in local hospitals to be started.
Professor Plibersek said, "These investments, are consistent with the best ways I've been told to improve the health system of Tasmania by early physicians."
The minister insisted that Tasmania's government would face strict reporting and accountability rule.
The state must maintain the current funding level to obtain the National Assembly funds, and report every month where the additional funds are being drilled.
The funds of three members will be formed to ensure service by the state in an effective and efficient manner as possible.
Mr Wilkie said that $325 million would not mean much until the actual improvements are made to bring Tasmania's public health system to a more constituent level."
However they, praised the government for responding to their request for immediate assistance, which they first brought before the Prime Minister in early May."
Mr Willy said, "I hope that the federal aid package towards separating the state re-public health system from the crisis-sponsored list will be very helpful."
According to the state government, these additional alternative processes will largely prioritize the recent cuts.
But federal dissident health spokesman Peter Thompson believes today's announcement is "band-ad solution."
He told A.B.C. TV, "We are here for this reason because the Labor State government has taken $430 million in its health system.
You can't believe it as a good news day to be transported by the state government about half a billion dollars and to be given $300 million by the National Assembly.
Mr. Dwton demanded that the U.S. Plibersek should give Garanti that not one of the bailout packages would be drilled on additional employment.

But since Edward Snowdon, a professor who has made Whistlebloor, began to tell American surveillance his secrets, the European government and leaders of the business world are no longer sure that the directors do not follow their word.
The U.S. National Security Agency reported spying on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers Google and Yahoo, along with Yahoo, expressed state oversight.
The last thing came when it turned out that Chancellor Angela Markel's phone was bugged, probably a decade earlier.

There is a major change in cloud computing in the Internet where European authorities are more vigilant that data stored in the United States is subject to that jurisdiction and has therefore become potentially sensitive.

Jim Snabee, the co-chief executive officer of the SAP, says: "We saw a new question that didn't come to customers a year ago – that is - my data is stored? and can you guarantee that it will remain physically in that jurisdiction?"
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are simply confirming what they were already aware of: that powerful states want to steal their most expensive secrets and data and that it should be a watch at every price for this.
That economic spying is not a surprise.
It's always been.

The Discovering of Obama’s Prosecutors
I twice voted to Obama in anticipation of the change
They say that Obama's great efforts have been hampered by the policy of the GM.P.
The policy of blocking can't provide excuse for drone attacks, the suffering of the Obamacare website
The 2008 campen of Obama Year reminds us of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morice is a second year old student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading very sad books today.
It's a book that I think this second year will be my enthusiasm during the medical school's poison and make me feel optimistic.
Its name is "Geting's Courage", and it is the memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election campaign.
When I find it to be moved by the perches of my patients in the night, and I go to bed, this book takes me to a period in which politics inspired millions of people and could keep your breath.
Elections proved to be a matter of fact, and news speakers had taken a break to show the historical significance of the time.
My relatives had tears of joy in the eyes of my fathers, and my parents saved every meeting newspaper.
A crew of young telescope individuals were on their way to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
He had an 82 percent approval rating while Obama became president in 2008.
And then I stopped the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, like returning from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a distant memory, a sad memory of lost opportunities.
There was really a change after I first voted Ky.
If simply say, none of it could imagine.
I credit Obama with a lot of accomplishments, from the Affordable Care Act to the return of our army from the United States, "Don't tell you", taking the end of Osama bin to kill him.
In addition I believe that the policy of anti-partisan opposition has prevented much of our efforts to advance our country: including non-resident reform, public options for health service, closures on Guantanamo Bay, and other than those involved.
But the innocent times in which I took my side to the Obama administration and to the partners, and I can give them the answer.
I've reached the point of political despair.
Republican's opposition policy is not the answer to the spying of foreign leaders, nor is there an answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond by the National Security Agency to store data about the private lives of ordinary U.S. citizens nor to answer the government's misdemeanors on people who expose the wrong.
It cannot tell the cause of the murder of U.S. citizen Anwar El Avalaki without a trial, nor does it be of public funds and practices that would have been reduced during the President's campen.
This cannot answer the findings of that report, which says that efforts by the White House to silence the media "the Nixon have been the most aggressive ever since the administration."
And most recently, after three years of being signed into the Law of the Affordable Care Act, cannot give an excuse to design a simple website.
I don't know if I just expected it.
If, at the age of 18, I should have assumed that the system of government, could break the political campaign that brought it forward.
It is obvious that the inaugural office is not a pre-equiname route, as anti-abortion political parties and anti-Semitic events such as Newtown massacres, will shape our public discussion.
Yet all the examples I have given above appear to have been chosen by the arbitrary administration itself.
This is what makes you most upset.
I voted again in 2012 for Obama, but not because I was ashamed of his candidate.
Mit Romney presented a confused and an uncertain option, which did not seem like determining their policies or their position.
I thought a second term for Obama, which would be free from pressure from future elections, would fulfill the hopes we've been listening for a long time.
However, while Obama's endorsement rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return in the year 2008 through that book.
Seeing him, I remember their lost promises.
In this week, a portion of the book was reading, describing how Klinton was not much damaged due to Obama in the Pencilvania primary.
At a post-martum campen meeting he told his subordinate staff that they needed to return to the panel, and to remain true on their aims.
He said "I want to get my Mojo back."
We should remember who we are."
Five years later, President Sir I can't agree with you any more today.
The ideas expressed in this comment are that of Nathaniel Moris.

It has been said from the government that 29,954 are members of the military army of President Abed Assad, 18,678 are fighters on behalf of the government, and 187 Lebanizah are Ugrinists.
It also said that there are 2,202 troops among the dead and about 5,375 bird fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the U.N. expressed speculation that nearly 100,000 people have died in the ongoing conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since.
Because of this conflict, nearly 20 million people have been reluctant to leave the country.
Assad's military group fought the rebels for several weeks in Safira, many of whom were related to al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, the Laboratory said that people on both sides were shocked, but clearly said nothing.
This war, the threat posed by chemical weapons inspectors, who have a very short-time-limit, is to finish the toxic weapon in Syria during the ongoing civil war.
The statement to the O.P.C.D.D., working together with the United Nations, said that its crew "is satisfied and has confirmed - and that all of Syria's declared production and mixing tools - have seen as destroyed."
It also said, "No further monitoring activity is being planned."
At the beginning of this week, inspectors had said that he had gone to 21 of the 23 centers announced by Dumscus and completed the first stage of the confirmation work.
Supervisors said they were not able to go to two centers for security reasons.
On Friday, O.P.C.D.L. said that, according to Syria, these two centers "has been abandoned and... chemical weapons products stored there were brought to other centers, which have been monitored."
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in the Fara, one of the two centers or not, where the inspectors of O.P.C.D. were not able to go.
Syria has submitted plans for the entire destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be accepted by the Executive Committee of O.P.C.D. next month.
Ahmad Ujumku, chief executive of the group who oversees in the ongoing comment by O.P.C.D., said, "I salute the strength shown by you and the commitment I am in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever made by this organization."
This civil war has been largely the government of Assad and its security forces, including members of the sect, in addition to Shia Islam, and the conflict between rebel Muslims.
In other incidents, Rami Abdurrahman, head of the abzarvetary, said that there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday at the Air Defense Center in Syria's coastal area of Latakia.
He said the cause of this explosion is not yet known.
In the case of Nortel Patent, Google, Sasmang, Huai has been prosecuted by the economic lawsuit.
Thousands of former Nortel patents have filed a lot of patent lawsuits against the group, including the cell phone manufacturers, including Google, which it had given in the Nortel Publications.
Union called Rockstar which purchased Nortel Patents in 4.5 billion has prosecuted Samsung Electronics Con Limited, H.C. Corporation, Huwai and four other companies for patent violations in the U.S. district court in Texas.
Rockstar is owned jointly by Apple Microsoft, BlackBerry, Eriction, and Sony.
There is a charge of violating seven patents over Google.
The newspaper said that these patents also include the technology that combines the words to be sought on television with consistent advertising with words, which is the main part of Google's search business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huai, H.T.C., and Rockstar could not be immediately contacted.
Samsung, Huai, and H.T.C. all make up phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which are strongly opposed to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011 Google had an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel Patents.
Google finally offered $4.4 billion, increasing in speech several times.
After losing to Rockstar in Nortel Patents, Google purchased Motorola Mobility in $12.5 billion, one of the main reasons Motorola had a long list of patents.
The newspaper said that Google has violated, and is constantly violating, despite losing in an attempt to warrant patents-in-suit in Nilami.
Rockstar has called for increased inflation against Google, as it claims, according to the charge, that patents are unconstitutional by Google.
F.A.A.: Aired Yatrigen can now use gadget in the air (but cell phones cannot call from)
Airmen will be able to use their electronic device to read, work, play games, play games, watch music, listen to music - but will not be able to talk to their cellphone - such a federal aviation administration is highly relevant to the highly-oriented direction by the federal administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
Michael Huarta, the administrator of F.A.A. at a news conference, said how fast these changes are immobilized, it will be different in each airline.
The airlines must recognize the way their aircraft, new guidelines, and how their aircraft complete new guidelines, and how their crews' training books and devices are upd to collect the training books and the rules to collect the devices to show guidelines.
F.A. has said that it has already obtained plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic device on the aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
F.A.A. said in a statement, "Bas the state of planning, we can very quickly approve the extended use of the electronic device.
Phillies, passengers need to close their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the plane door is closed.
They are expected not to start until they reach 10,000 feet of the plane and be allowed by the captain.
Passengers are expected to stop their device again when the plane is landed, and don't let the plane go down again until it is completely landed.
F.A.A. said, within new guidelines airlines whose aircraft are fully safe from electronic cartridges can allow their passengers to fly by plane, landing and using a taxi-induced device when they fly by plane, and use the time of taxiing.
Most new airline companies and other aircraft that have been modified in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these norms.
The president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendant, Laura Glading, has welcomed these changes.
In a statement, Glading said, "When policy is in a safe way - and we will work together with airlines companies to do so - it will be a victory for both parties."
When it comes to this issue, we've been trying to get along with the likes of "hall monitors".
Agencies said that but it would still remain restricted by connecting it at less than 10,000 feet high, delivering emails, sending messages or obtaining, or downloading.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets, and other devices in airplane mode.
So there will still be no conversation with friends, the online Scral-like game, which is the famous event that in 2011 when actor Elek Baldwin, playing on his smartphone while the plane was on his way to the door, and the American airlines were off the plane when they were banned from the device.
And even if a laptop, such as heavy equipment, etc., must still be collected because their jump will concern the other person in the cabin.
Cellphone calls will also continue to be banned during flight.
The legislative authority relating to the phone call is near the federal communications agency, not near the F.A.
F.A.A. may remove restrictions on some electronic device while flying and landing of the aircraft.
Last month, Mark Rochenkan of the National Transport Safety Council who is the national transport security expert of the C.B.S. News said the cell phone is still considered a risk.
Rogere said, "Cell phones are really serious issues, not just because they can potentially generate in a navigation-related device, but even because they can generate leaks in cell towers when in the air.
To investigate the issue, the Industry World Advisory Committee, formed by the F.A.A., has construed last month that the government should allow more use of the individual electronic device.
Pressure has been increasing in recent years on the F.A.A. to reduce the ban from their use.
An interviewer such as Sen. Claire McKascalk, D-Mo, has said that there is no valid security reason for the ban.
These restrictions are becoming even harder to be able to practice because the use of the device is irrevocable.
Some studies also indicate that about thirds of passengers forget or ignore instructions to close their device.
The F.A. began to ban the use of electronic device by passengers in the year 1996, when reports of communications were received by passengers due to the F.M. radio and the high-techn gadget carrying of the time-to-do device.
New airlines, more dependent on the electrical system than the previous generation of aircraft, are also designed and accepted by the F.A.A. to be resistance to electronic intervention.
Airlines have been proposed using Wi-Fi at a cruisering altitude from passengers for many years.
The aircraft modified for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to the pipeline.
Huarta said that most airlines companies should meet merit warrants for greater use of electronic device within the new guidelines.
The electronic device of today's time, emits radio transmissions of much less power than the electronic device of the previous generation.
For example, e-readers, there is an entirely nominal transmission while turning the page.
But transmissions are powerful when download or send data by the device.
There has also been Amazon.com among those taking sides to reduce the ban on the use of the device by passengers.
In 2011 company officials loaded their entire Kindle e-Reders in airlines and fired it to test problems but found no such problem.
The F.A.A. Advisory Committee on the risk used by the device has expressed mixed-juli feelings.
Douglas Kid of the National Air Force said that they believe that the device-sharing is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said that, there are only reports described by the pilot in support of being thrown by the device in the aircraft system, most of which are older.
However, committee members agreed that the F.A. would allow the pilot to order passengers to shut down the device when the aircraft is fired in less visibility.
The travel industry group has welcomed the changes and told them, the general knowledge of people who traveled during the latest round of technology.
C.E.O. Roger Do of the U.S. Travel Association said that we are pleased that the F.A.A. has recognized that the passenger traveling with joy, is not inconsistent with survival and security.

The police's fast jeep truck collided this morning near the Torra police patrol in the Tajganj Thana area.
In this accident, all of the inspector registers died on the occasion of the lion while four constables are seriously injured.

The schools apologised to pay more attention to mathematics, spleing, and grammar
In the texts of English literature, students must read a play of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, Romantic Poetry, and the later British story of 1914.
The test will also include "no visible text" in order to encourage more reading.
A combined English literature and language curriculum will be eliminated.
From 2015 students must take a separate G.C.S.E. in language, and will be very prolific to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will issue new curriculum for English and mathematics tomorrow - these will be the first subjects to have radical changes.
It will also change to the second main topics next year.
In a different step, the test will show changes in the structure of the G.C.S.E. with the legislative interface, the new grading system, and the low curriculum.
Speaking in the heat, Secretary of Education Michael Gov, had said that "was much more unanimous about this that, in order to establish people's belief in purging we need to improve our test system," he said that ‘G.C.E. would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more severe".
Studies found that English schools devote less time to mathematics - 116 hours a year or - less than 3 hours a week during session compared to most countries.
According to comparison, Australian schools provide students with 143 hours in an average of one year, while Singapore has an average of 138 hours.
While, there is no formal need to give mathematics more time to Heagi, association sources said that the broad mathematics was likely to encourage additional education in providing schools from being arranged for more weight with subjects in the GC.S.E. - league table.
This curriculum will focus more on "the problems of the real world", including financial mathematics.
From a dispute for seat width at large orders of jet manufacturers at the foot.
This month's Dubai is a conspiracy to set up a lie for the dispute for long-range flights between the front aircraft manufacturers for the width of the tourist-class seats
The controversy focuses on the width of the Economy class seat in the aircraft of long flights, as not always being given by Erlines but whose assigned efficiency has been claimed to be the lienn Jet Sáebs and Boong Company being key.
Erbus gives an extensive seat of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in Economy Cabin this week has hoped for such an industry standard but it should be set by Erlines says its principal-resistant booing.
The dispute comes between the aircraft manufacturer when the large varson of the long-distance Ercroft engine from the order recorded in the potential after the 17-21 event began to be sold.
How is the previous section of the aircraft created-- especially whether the seating is 9 or 10 equal to the more capacity's claims being prepared by the Mini jumbo jets in view?
Boing says it is "777 X" that will keep 406 people 17 inches wide and in a row 10 logo uniform.
Airbus says it will take 350 people left 18 inches equal to 9 equal seats.
The aircraft diggers often trade on technical matters through advertising in the business press.
Now, Airbus is expected to dominate more than 100 orders in Dubai Arshō with 777 X, such is appealing to the public ahead.
What is being seen since the beginning of the recent outbreak of the war?
Airbus sales chief John Lehi called "Boing Regional Turbo is also offering long-range flights to the narrows."
As a change, people are getting bigger, but the way to sit the plane isn't changed.
According to U.S. Department of Health statistics, between the 1970s when the Boating 747 jumbo ne modern long time ki travel defined ta, and the average of 40 - year - old American male weighed 10 percent increased by 10 percent.
According to U.S. health statistics, the average American man's waist in the 21st century is 39.7 inches,.
Airbus says its opponent is sticking to a 1950 seat concept when the new name was a narrower average of "Jet set", respectively.
Airbus says they have established a research commission that suggests an additional 53 percent sleep quality in the width of the seat.
Boing disputed the data of the seat measure of Airbus, and said it does not depend on the decision of manufacturers to how airlines form a balance between rent and convenience.
It also says, the research shows depending on the experience of a cabin more than the width of a seat.
Boing cabin expert Kent Kravier said that."It's really in providing airlines with flexibility and the belief in those things they need to do to succeed."
"They don't want to tell us who they benefit from."
They know their business better than anyone else.
For the Flyers it's about the dining room, but it's a quick issue for suppliers that it can affect income.
The Andes of at least $700 billion behind this dispute is the aircraft order's scale of the U.S. and European exports is enough, in the coming decades.
Ryter's report reported for the first time in July, what seat layout is actually the battle issue between new jet aircraft.
Airbus and Boing claimed to have had 20 percent functional per seat in their new multi-denominational Angen design of that section, compared to 365-seat Boing 777-300 Er.
Boing's claim to performance depends on the 10-like 777 X van original 9 with a comparison with the 777.
With profits in unit cost 10 equivalents now have been used.
Kevin Kenyston, head of Europe's Airbus passenger facility says "This of Boing is doing more to make more rivals with our products, with more competitors."
On the other hand, analysts say the entire 10-seat-per-line cabin is suggested for the existing 777 S that many passengers have a densor layout side, which can be rented as well.
Cabin interior expert My Kerby, founder and editor's runway girl network said" The eighteen inch seat width will be very good for passengers, but the reality is that this business point of Airbus is operated by threat of 777"
Airbus and Boing seats do not provide but are providing a list to choose from suppliers for Airlines.
Jet salespeople around the world also take careful measures to check on this layouts.
While relaving, all builders are also giving high-density layouts for low-cost aircraft services and regional travel of jet aircraft.
Airbus giving He's a 10-e equal A350 but says it's not yet sold.
But recently until, Airbus emphasized extensive cabin seats on some of its jet aircraft to need more cabin facility.
Modern jet aircraft are unlikely to fly on a new industry standard without the support of the other manufacturer but it can divert from a 777 X sale wave.

Youth Before Time: Growing Up early
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls get young at a lower age than the gory girls of their age.
Physical change does not mean that youth is close
There are no witnesses that horomon or any other chemical can be blamed
Experts believe that mildness anger can be a cause of youth in a low age
The case of youth before time is not as effective among boys
Pat Etheriz, former communicator of C.N., is an expert journalist in the health and family issues of children.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter must develop a breast develop and start using her own 7 or 8 years of age?
This week at the annual conference of the American Children's Academy of Children's Children's Children's Children's Endocrinchronologist Dr. Paul Caplowitz explained that these early physical changes are common in American girls, these shows new running.
Caplowitz says, "I spend a lot of time giving parents this confidence - that generally it does not show rapid progress in the direction of full youth."
The apparent symptoms of development, such as the survival of breasts, and the hair of the liver, and physical odor, are looking before time in girls.
But over the past four decades, there has been a very minor change in the age of Razoshan (the first monthly-religion).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in the year 1970.
"When the breasts begin to develop, the first rheumatism takes at least two to three years" Caplowitz states, which are also "time-presumably youth in the boys: the authors of this general problem."
The most accurate test time of youth's development is time.
There is debate about what is the beginning of youth, but when the breast development increases with breast development before 8 years of age two calls it "child-pold".
In most cases this process will slow or stop - whose child doctors can closely monitor.
In the event of more rapid progress, testing may be required by the entochrocrinologist to eliminate the potential for serious problems such as tumors or sist.
There are treatments to delay time-pre-emind monthly-religion and other outcomes: the time-pre-education of bones, which can lead to undeveloped growth and adult as a nata.
Constituencies for drug or hoormon treatment, child age, development rate, growth rate, and emotional adulthood.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplowitzs are awake about drugs but admit, "Repressing the yewn can increase the behavioral issue, and girls may begin to feel different from their peers."
The other major problem can be considered: Parents just don't want their underage daughter to have monthly religion.
Caplowitz said, "They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will keep hygiene."
A woman whose daughter had begun monthly religion at the age of 10, recalls, "It was a shock."
Although there were signs of this and we also talked about monthly religion, she was not emotionally prepared.
She was afraid of her school and returned to harass that she had first begun monthly religion among her children.
There are many well-suited principles about the causes of untimely youth.
However, there is no ongoing testimony to charge Hormon in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexually transmitted messages in the media.
Boys too - like girls - are getting time-to-preparatory youth.
Caplovitz determines the rule that its main reason is the outbreak of stereocation.
He had helped conduct studies over girls aged 6 to 9 in 2001, connecting the body's fat to the time of youth.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are also many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to get youth before their ageing gory girls.
There are many explanations of this.
At the global level, the representation of time-presumably youth, from economic situations to weather & genes, seems to be affected by all things.
Other puzzles: Although the boys are getting the hair of the face and the children of the boy, the whole course of youth is not as clear in them as the girls.
Other doctors who attended the A.A.P. conference supported the complexity of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it has become common to be seen by the hair of the liver and the hair of the living.
The Children's physician at the Gorèbe Children's Hospital in Morristown, Newsery, Dr. Louis Silverman says, "We need to be careful about how we identify the real beginning of youth."
Parents should not hesitate to take guidance from their child physician to take an opinion about how to talk to your children.
Caplowitz advised, "It may mean talk before expected time."
If you're calm, your child will answer properly.
Girls who pre-developed from time to time need to be trusted that even if it's been preceded by time but it is part of normal life.
Ejaz Jan, the legislator of the Punch protest area, opened the water cooler in the Gurdwara area.

Cocaine's alleged information about the police investigation to Mr. Big
42-year-old Detta reported to the notorious criminal Neil Scarboro
The president thought people could find out about his confidential drug addiction
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
To the top lawyer on the defense side, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he was afraid people will find out about his secret addiction of his drug, three years of imprisonment.
After 42-year-old Brashat Ditta agreed in the wake of his cocaine's addiction, the notorious criminal would provide sensitive information about his drug trafficking investigation to Neil Scarboro.
This president, who was nicknamed "Bash", and praised by the perpetrators as "Top Brief", was arrested from his home in 2011 after police surveillance operation in Scarboro, which he represented in the previous narcotics trial.
Officials had seen 32-year-old Scarboro holding three bags of cocaine in the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he went out with his classmates to the Law Society.
After meeting Cocaun's cones in Ditta's hair, his shoes, and his credit card found that Ditta was a "ruled user" of the drug drugs of the Ditta A category.
During an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he tried to get unmanned about the arrest of two people from Scarboro and his colleague.
All four related were being supervised by the police at that time as part of the Heroine and the main investigation of the Cocaine gang operating in Lancashire, Cumbria, Marsesside, Burkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 other individuals who were sent to prison after being seized by police 1.5 million pounds of price heroine and cocaine, and more than 200,000 pounds of cash were seized during several prints.
42-year-old Detta would provide information to criminals, as he feared people would not find out about his cocaine addiction.
The situation in Blackbombund was facing the Repoll Crown Court today after being found guilty in two cases of forcing the course of justice after three weeks of running trial in the law firm Forbes Solicitors.
He had admitted to having a cocaine at the earlier hearing.
The prosecutor's bad time began when police learned Scarboro were in contact with Ditta on a regular phone from February 2011.
Two spies followed the relation and saw him coming to Ditta's house and keeping more than 60 percent of the purported drugs under the attorney's bin in the Black Golf Glove.
After the drug was kept in contact with Scarboro Ditta on the phone regularly, which went out to the Black Rivers football stadium, Ewood Park.
The lawyer found out when he arrived home that there had been a drug and had had a dialogue between them nine times.
The court heard that he had found Cocaine's "ruled user" in an investigation into A category of drug signal on Ditta's hair, shoes and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused him to use Cocaine and said he was talking to the relevant dealer, because he was his client and said that his discussions were "the subject of methodical privilege".
During his arrest Ditta took his wall out and tried to remove a lot of credit cards, but they were seized, and his hair was sampled.
In police testimony, he said he ran office from his home along with his work-place, and his clients would call at his home for methodical matters.
After being told by the main individuals arrested that the spies knew about them, the court hearing said that the Ditta Nasilly had phoned the leading people of the drug supply chain, of which some of the people he had previously submitted.
Anne White from the planning side said that: "The criminal president should be best aware of not breaking the law."
Mr. Ditta is accused of misuse of his position as a criminal president, much more to his particular client.
We're not talking about the relationship of the common drug dealer, but dealer that's providing drugs to our lawyer.
Some of their conversations would certainly have been methodical without any doubt, because he was a lawyer.
But he went out far beyond his limitation of the lawyer-Client relationship.
As much as possible, forced the police's investigation so that they would be able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was not respecting his profession, but insulting.
He made a lot more approaches to some of the definite clients, especially from Scarboro, and he allowed a settlement with his freedom.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed that: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which was not I, and if I wanted to inform Mr. Scarboro, I wouldn't wait for 15 hours, but I would do it for 15 hours.
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halsteed of the Lancashire Police said that: "At the time the organized criminals began to receive drugs from organized criminals, they transformed themselves from the criminal."
The addiction cause of his cocaine they made trems compromises and became too much weak to the objectives of the early members of organized crime groups, who used it to obtain significant information relating to the police investigation.
Prosecutors should maintain the highest standard of truth, and to fill faith and confidence in people.
Mr. Ditta has been cheating on this belief and sought to survive in the horizontal of his profession.
Lancashire's serious and organized crime unit examined Mr. Ditta, which also found them guilty of three incidents of keeping Cocaine and forcing the course of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bringing criminals to the court.
This case should work out a warning for criminals that no one is far from the reach of the law.
We'll find you and submit to the court.
Scarboro was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply Heroine, Cocaine, and Bang.
Other members involved in the gang were sent to prison for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
Ditta on his website gave questions and answers about himself, in which he said that his Fantsai Job would be a lawyer for the death penalty client in the United States to be a lawyer, to be their guest of their hospitality and the work being an inspiration for them.
Falling into the home of the bomber as the plane's delivery, a drop in orders
Canada's aircraft and train mecker Bombardier Inc reported a drop of 15 percent in net profit on Thursday, in its unit in the third quarter and contracts on contracts by aircraft order and procedural pressure from it.
Montreal-based Bombardier also offered an update to any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft release or aircraft to go into commercial service from next September to its ambitious program of going into commercial service.
Another half a month before the first flight of the test plane, it's just three times, the question raised whether the test is on the walk track or not.
The result dropped less than forecasting and sent for over 8 percent of the slide to the share Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst share with the National Bank Financial, had reduced its rating from "Mat" from "Mat" on Thursday to "the area" stock is limited over the next one or two trimmings.
"The aircraft delivery was mostly expected, we are obviously disappointed with the margin performance in transport, "Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive new orders for the Bombier Series as the progress of the flight's testing program.
Although if no new orders are announcing in the coming months, the market program will be sshocked.
Bombardier hopes the flight families can now cut it at a low end to the wrench market of Boing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft unveiled in March and was flighted for the first time in September after the month of delay.
Possible Cretaceant new jetliners await the outcome of flight testing to validate the company's claims about fuel efficiency and potential cost savings but as are up to moderate of the CSReries up to the firmer 177.
403 full order and restraint are available with 15 customers' and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Badoin believed the Bombardier would complete its 300 firm order goal from the time it was first brought into jet commercial use.
Officials convinced analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was running according to the schedule.
"The aircraft had been on land for a long time in a forecast comparison," Bodoin said in a conference call, also adding it to the ground test and software update aircraft.
Every manufacturers make a different way schedule.
We've decided to make an first flight and make an updated period and say what we've done.
That'll all be through the flight program.
The second remainder of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the upcoming season, with the following shortly after, the company said
However, analysts are suspected customers can start operating a CSeries aircraft after their first flight in the first 12 months.
Bombardier has said it was evaluated the Service (ES) index in the entry and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow pace of the test - though in line with the internal index of the bomber - confirms our idea that the service in the entry will be pushed into Q1/15," Dorsen said.
For the third quarter finish on September 30, the purported profits of the Bombardier fell to $147million a year ago, or 8 cents per share, $172million, or per share 9 cents.
The per share adjusted income remained unchanged at 9 cents.
The royalties amount to $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion in modest inflation.
According to analysts Thomson Reuters I/B/ES, the revenue of 10 per share cent and $4.56 billion was expected to be received.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer said that 45 aircraft were deployed during the trimester down a year ago, a year before 57
The net order fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
Backlog in the Aerospace Division was $3.9 billion on September 30, no change from December.
"Aerospace, the results were in line with our guidance, but the consumption of the following order and overall the state of the market were a disappointment," Bodoin said.
Aerospace royalties fell by 13 percent in $2 billion.
Bombardier said that the world's largest train manufacturer, the division had an increase of about 11 percent for $2.1 billion in royalties.
Orders in the transport unit were backlogs of about September 30 of, above about December 31.
Some large contracts in the margin of the transport sector were also affected by performance issues.
Executive officials said new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter.

Embraer SA of Brazil, the world's third largest professional aircraft manufacturer and closest opponent of the boardier, reported a 10 percent drop in the quarter profit on Thursday.
Parents of Intersex Kids can choose their children's ‘sexual undefined'
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to approve the third gender for children born with vague relationships.
Now newborn children will not be specified in a fair way.
According to the new law, parents do not need to declare sex for such children; this law allows them to declare gender ‘undefined' or "unspecified" on the child's birth certificate.
The purpose of the new law is to reduce pressure over parents who can take decisions relating to sex-determining surgery for newborn children, and to conflict against intersex children.
According to B.B.C. an intersex person said years later, "I'm neither male, nor woman."
I'll keep a handmade by doctors, stainless pane.
According to the estimate, one of 2,000 children each year is a child who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 situations, which occur within the examination of disorders of sexual development, is the collective word used for abnormal attribute, genus, or acre, or unusually developed sex.
Maybe Vallis Simpson is intersex.
Gender identification is still not properly understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when gender-related cannot be, it is better to use the best information present to specify and to perform surgery, if such a person, monitor the child's and physical development before.
Dr. Jack Drešer, a New York city psychologist who is a specialist in sex-incredibility cases, said that Germany's new law "looks a good thing."
Intersex children create moral problems.
He said, "Some people are in a state like a soul that requires surgery, but it doesn't happen to most children."
You can specify sex without surgery, and see after how the identity develops.
The science of knowing how any sex will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No one can answer properly about why this happens.
It's a kind of puzzle why people are gay.
The report, introduced to the European Commission in 2011, describes intersex people as different from those of transsexual or transgender people, because their position is not related to gender but to its biological design, which is neither clearly male but either a united form of either female or either of the two are clearly defined.
These characteristics can display themselves secondary sexual ensemaries, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breast and length; primary sexual aggregations such as reproduction organs and relationships; or in quality structure and hoormon.
The report provides phylocons about discrimination faced in the field of jobs by intersex and transgender individuals, as well as harassment, violence, and bias crimes.
There are now special camps for boys with non-union sex.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed older individuals to mark men, women or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, the 52-year-old Australian Norri Me-Welby, after winning the legal appeal made to hold life-performing "unidentified" gender status became the world's first recognized-in-law "Lingless" person in the world.
According to the Interior Ministry, the German passport will also have a third specified as X for intersex individuals in addition to M or F.
According to the news report on France 24, issues associated with sex in neighbouring countries France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French regime-makers from this strict Catholic country have signed Yankees to go back to "sexual principle" from the school books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also objected to this law in Germany by saying, "While the world is going into a state where gender is the choice to be chosen itself, but not sexual intercourse, we are taking two more columns of civilization in the opposite direction."
In Maryland, the newborn's mother also told Baby Zone that she would like to see children be specified sex when they were born.
He said on the website about the upbring, "The upbending without limits is very stressful, especially if you don't even know what your child's sex."
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both men and women's relatives were called Hermafrodites (ubearing), named Sundar Greek god who were twins.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world regarded sex as slate which could be deleted and then written.
But now a lot of people are challenging the morality of medicine, they understand that sex-related is complex work, and sometimes even mistakes from physicians, who don't know what children will feel about their gender specimitation when they grow up.
Drescher says "In the mid-century, it was called "monrog early".
When these children were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you used to call the surgeon.
The existing principle about the treatment of children with vague relationships was presented by Dr. John Manny of John Hapkins University, who considered sex to be a good-to-do.
He designed the word "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental signs - how parents raise children - by interacting with the child's gene and hormones that he should be identified as a man or as a woman.
But in a case of 1966, known as "John/Joan", his theories became disputed.
He advised the parents of a child whose sex had been accidental sex during the sexual-enactment (circumsission) to make a full bond of the child and expel his and her redundancy girl.
Drender said, "Manny presented that case as a successful case of statehood, but he did not."
At the age of 15, the child turned himself back as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors are still "following the same representation".
But with the arrival of the psychiatry in the years after 1990, individuals passing through these sex surgery began to come face to face with "not happy with the truth."
Such was the case with Montana's 36-year-old writer Jim Bruce, born with X.W. man attribute, but his brother-in-law was unclear.
Doctors did not clearly understand that his sex was small, or his brother-in-face was big, but they were certain that he could never live "satistrial life as a man".
Therefore, just after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and anthropology were excluded and raised like a girl.
She was given female hoormons at the age of 12.
She told ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl."
I wasn't happy, but it was very difficult to question.
At the age of 18, he was going to be vazinoplasty with him.
But feeling incompetent and somewhat confusion, he called for medical archives.
This showed him the scary truth.
I was tied up at birth - and no one ever told me.
Bruce had been born with D.S.D., which prevented her body from making a sufficient amount of testosterone, which did not cause his survival to develop properly.
After learning the truth, he became a man back, he took the dose of testosterone and gave his breasts.
He was barren because of the surgery.
Today, he explains his conceptualize people about intersex individuals in the organization called the Interface Project.
However, California-based legislative group Advocates for Informed Chwais express concern that Germany's law "chippi and contempt invites."
They say, "A lot of activists think Germany's law will inspire parents to make quick decisions and specify the child "determined"."
We're afraid it will encourage intervention.
We think it's a better process to specify a man or female sex instead of waiting.
But we don't know how the law will play its role, so we can just guess.
Tamer-Matis said their organization supports Australian law because "it allows adults to be identified in the third gender."
He said, "The adults about methodical sex should be able to make their own decision."
Germany's law is related to specifying it at birth.
It's not a jungle fought by newborn children at this time.
When we grow up, they can take decisions relating to their own body.
But Pittsburg's breast radiologist Dr. Erlene Baratz whose daughter has sexual development disorders, and who assists hundreds of others in the support group, said that Germany's law will provide "power to both parents and children."
Baratji's daughter Katie was born with male properties, but she was a D.S.D. called full Android Insensitivity constituency.
Since her Androgen was guilty in the grey, female ensembles developed in Katy.
In his body, Jonah is but not a womb or a dynasties.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and is a Resident in the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to be a mother through adoption or a guestional serrogacy.
Baratz said, "This law provides parents with no decision on their own."
It provides them, ‘men' or ‘women' with proper means by some examination before writing.
That way, you stay healthy - raise the baby, love the child.
You have a cute kid and enjoy it.
We don't have to get a surgery in the prison that can't be returned.
He said, "It brings children to the decision-making process and frees the hatred that inspires parents because they don't believe they are right."
Finally, the child will determine which sex he is more easy with -- and it will be a very good thing.
This enables children to make decisions for their own.
The beautiful expression was presented in line with the 'another well-to-do' storyline, showing harmony in the Dwar era and today's circumstances.
It was shown that in what veins in today's perspective a guild is bound to walk on a guru wrong path.

Clive Palmer claimed that the P.M. Tony Abbott's interest struggle about the parent holiday plan is a conflict
Billionaire M.P. Clive Palmer has said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott's interest about the parent holiday plan is because their daughters can be pregnant, and take it advantage.
The Grand Duchy of the Mining Area, as taking the payment of a $6 million carbon tax bill in dispute, has claimed, while they have tried to answer questions about the conflict.
The Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be important in determining how to reduce carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only the interests of ministers may be a struggle, and said that the daughters of Ms. Abbott can personally benefit from policies.
Mr. Palmer said "They may have an important interest struggle in the matter of a practurable holiday, because if any of their daughters are pregnant, they will have a direct interest that they will not receive leave."
Two months after the election, the electoral commission has officially declared Ms. Palmer the winner by 53 votes of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat after falling again.
Mr. Palmer called for the gyrifier of the election count to advance the process at a fast pace.
Tony Aot's daughters François and Bridget.
Should the outcome of the election come two months after we are vacated?
He said "We should have a better system."
Why can't we have a system in which we will fill our disregard on the computer, immediately vote and we have results at 6:30 p.m.
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark on the newspapers.
That's because if a person doesn't like him, can heal it?
It seems to be absolutely reluctant to use the pencil in today's period.
The Election Commission is studying options for electronic compensation, and has recently issued a joint letter with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his policies included an international airport being built for the U.S. Coast, and that they would take their new work very hard.
The public position is for public service.
He said "We need no reward other than the award of history that we can serve the community at this important time."
George Kerevan: Euro collapse optioned the Scots
Another day, another story of the fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that free Scotland would be required to join as a free travel zone throughout Europe as a condition of membership of E.U.
Passport control over Berwick and signs stories about the limit of the contidal wire on the walls of Hadrian.
It is true that the Strathclide paper described the potential economic benefits of free access to the rest of Europe, though - not described in the Headlines.
Neither one described that E.U. members spend most of their time changing their formal rules as they need.
Since Scotland is no longer the shedding area, Brussels will be free for continuous non-union Brussels in exchange for achieving whatever it really wants from Scotland.
So, then, a-kni.
And the thing that's been trapped for so long has been settled. First of all, I've been the first to hear "Freeness's passport control" news about 40 years ago.
However, the interesting point was lost in re-arranging this interesting old story.
Why should you expect Europe to be billed from free Scotland anyway?
Why should London's Yok be sold for Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the great, war-after-the plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the Euro crisis, Project Europe has officially been dead.
Throughout the E.U., groups dedicated to opposing the E.U. or close the euro as a similar currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the Euroscaptyl Alternative for Germany Party - which has only been founded this year - suddenly came and received nearly fifty million votes in the federal election of September, and thus out of Bundag the Free Democrats (the equivalent of our own Libe Dams) effectively out of the Bundag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to build federal Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, proved to be the a fundamental changer.
As well as the strict rules imposed by the Berlin and the European Central Bank, many people are having to think because of the barriers imposed on national economic systems through compliance with the same currency that Europe has gone too far.
The extremely budget loss of national governments did not have much role in the euro crisis - such was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system fixed the monetary exchange rate to its members on behalf of German exporters - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic monetary devaluement, Southern Europe finds itself in a state of the underlying loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only way is to reduce wages and public revenue - encouraged by Berlin.
Ongoing budget and currency problems far ahead of the deep European productivity rugility.
As a result of the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels to provide exemptions to French and German energy firms on consumer practice, European industries do double for electricity compared to the United Nations and four times for gas.
It's the cost damage that's penguined, which we've already seen in Grangemouth.
Even to be done all wages in the world, the European petrochemicals industry cannot be protected from being affected by the U.S. shell gas.
As a result, there has been a sense of rebellion among people, especially in France, who had once been the leading fan of the E.U.
After the EU, France's top politicians, had seen E.U. as a means to control Germany, and to provide Paris with the equivalent billing of Wanshigton in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political validity, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, which is causing the economy of France to fade.
Results: The Southerner of Marion Lee Penn, E.U. Opposition National Front has won the U.S. Socialist's third place in the recent sub-election.
At this time, France is the most popular group with 24 percent of the vote - it is the time warning for British Labor that they cannot believe that the collapse for the left, automatically profit to the right.
Lee Penn is doing with his new reputation in the middle of the French gores, the working class?
This group wants to make the use of E.U. elections to be held next year in the European Parliament to form an E.U. anti-communist, supreme monetary faction.
If, as is very likely, the E.U. opposition groups perform well in these elections, this type of coalition can first influence the European Parliament.
My view is: Soon the E.U. anti-communist and anti-Semitic anti-priopy in Europe will eliminate the euro.
The euro will not be completely finished, but it will reach back in some way like "(the sovereign) nations' Europe" which will be the support of General Dyon.
Germany and some of its follow-intelling economic systems can keep the euro, but France and Southern Europe will resume their currencies.
I expect the U.K. to keep itself away from this project in hopes of increasing approaches with the U.S.
However, the growing interest of Wanshigton in the UK indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after these most?
We can choose to remain the area of Little England (essentially).
Or we can protect our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to be different at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better work-making in the slow European system, provided that we keep our own currency.
It will be easier to work with other similar-minded countries in Europe of non-union nations.
Otherwise we should consider maintaining our economic freedom as we walk in the path of Norway.
The S.N.P. government in Scotland - notably - has been the most successful Mittability-resistant political campaign in Europe, which had won a surprising majority in the year 2011 based on the proposed (so active) cuts by Labor's Chancellor Ellistair Darling and then on the basis of the Tori-Lib Dame alliance.
It would be a matter of choice for Scotland to vote for freedom at this time, as in that position it must accept the rules of mitigation to be imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
So you thought of the last century, thank you?
Flight Center is advancing this phase.
The company has increased its full year profit forecast, and is expecting a record benefit from Holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.

The U.S. business had simulcasted its climoally weakly in its first sixties, and this is expected to give a third consecutive full year of profit.
Flight Center's shares were at $ 38.20 with an increase of 3 cents yesterday.

According to this report, the EU government has spent $8.5 million over the last four years to commemorate Chief Patel's genius.
Rather, in the NDA's ruling in contrast to Modi's claims (between the year 1999 to 2004) a round came during Atal Vihari Bajpayee's PM when no advertisement was issued by the government over two consecutive years (2001-2002) panel.
On Thursday, Modi, holding the base of the 182-metre-high 'Stachu of Baháʼí' image of the Chief Patel in Kvadia, Gujarat, said, 'There was no advertisement on the occasion of the Chief Patel's first.
While the records of the DAVP indicate that the EU has spent $30 million in 2009-10, $4.10 million in 2010-11, $2.7 million in 2011-12, and $1.4 million in 2012-13 on the Chief Panel's ads.

The EU did not bring any adverts on the panel in 2008.

Although the money spent on the advertisements of Chief Patel is much lower than the amount spent on the Giants and the Giants of the Nehru-Gandhi family members each year.
The DAVP spent $33 million for Mahatma Gandhi's genius and funerals, 21 million for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, $14.5 million for Indira Gandhi, and 9.38 million for Jawahar Lal Nehru on prints.
When asked about this gap from Manish Tuesday, he said, 'It should not be seen from the expense look at the ad.
Because the price of advertising depends on many things, including such things as the size of the ad or the rate of advertising for that year, etc.
The real thing is that it shows our dedication, which people who oppose it are engaged in trying to handle the legacy of a great leader without knowing about it.

Report: Opinions on the Biden dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, close advisers to President Barack Obama secretly considered Hillary Clinton in place of vice presidential term Kelley Biden for the 2012 ticket.
The most notable figure in the mystery is by Mark Halperin and John Helemann's heavy expected 2012 campaign Toom, "Double Down: Play Change 2012."
Times received a copy of the upcoming book and stated Thursday evening that the president's top advisors "extrouped group-setteries and late 2011" to know what dumping Biden could help in the hope of Obama's re-election to know.
According to Times National Political Associater Jonathan Martin, the book provides an effort to campaign for the chief authority and put the head of the former House Staff for the name, what effect does the effect on the pole of the former Secretary of State to learn from the Vice President of the State.
The possible switch switch was a very safe secret within the basics of the Chicago campaign and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen presidents' close advisors – including cast, former Obama campaign chief Jim Massina, and former White House senior advisors David Axlerod and David Palouffa - were under consideration.
The cast of "double down" claims to have tried to change Biden despite their personal balance of decision before finally making their information when Clinton's was telling him that there would be no improvement in Obama's situation.
In a testimony with Martin, the cast has confirmed that the administration had actually considered Clinton's place with Biden.
"Maene said in view of the whole scene, and one of them, it was," put it," said the newspaper.
You remember that the presidency at the time was at risk, so we were in such a way, "Holy Christ, what else would we do?"
While put as the research" caution", Martin had told CNN's Anderson Cooper again the election campaign made a significant investment in how much this claim would be to be put on the floor.
"The campaign doesn't spend on polling and focused groups like Paso until they are seriously considering something," Martin said on AC 360.
It's unclear, Halaki, whether Obama knew their team is looking for change.
Martin told CNN that he asked the cast, did their boss know about possible adjustments?
While cast said that they" did not think the president was aware of the possible change", the former Chief of Staff believed it was "probably" that Obama knew it.
"Double Down" certainly won't answer if the political investigation would go to Obama's desk? Martin and he told me.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama Biden dumping was not aware of the ticket inquiry.
"I'm sorry," Martin said.
Today he will meet the families of those killed at the rally in Patna last Sunday.

Own railway was found in the U.S.-Mexico Drug Mine
One of the most complex drug trafficking mines found between the U.S.A. and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail system.
The U.S. majority described the four-foot-quartered three-foot mine as one of the most complex secret routes discovered so far.
The mine is equivalent to the twi-med length of about six football pitches, connecting Tijuna, the nearby windows of Mexico, and the San Dig, U.S.A.
The area is full of similar gases, which make it easier to hide the truck being filled with drugs.
Officials said it had been shut down since before a drug passed from the mine.
According to the court's archives, authorities have seized eight and a half tons of carrots and 327 puddle cocaine, in connection with the search for the mine.
Three persons, of whom authorities reported to have been acting as drivers, were accused of being kept Marikula and cocaine for the purpose of distributing them.
When convicted, they may be sentenced from 10 years in prison to life imprisonment.
Nogeless, Tashkar in Arizona, takes advantage of the large groundwater exhaust streams.
This tunnel, the eighth major route discovered in San Digo from 2006 until now.
In October, some of the largest mines have been discovered after Central Mexico's Marilyn crop, which presents the challenge capable of drug mafia groups to how they quickly get the product to consumers.
In 2010 authorities found a route of about 700 yards equipped with rail tracks, stretching from a house in Tijuna to San Digos.

Although they had also spoken that they were also ready for a borough from the ministry to keep their word.
By the way, after the opinion that arose in the thought camp, there are new ideas of new ideas in the matter of targeting activists in government positions.
In the camp, the region JDU chairman Vashan Narayan Singh had said that the announcement of the activists' manonion in 20 Sutra Comets would be soon.
Their indication was also that the list was almost ready.
The news is coming that now Prime Minister Natalie Kumar will hand over the list from her own level.
They will also examine whether the opinion of legislators-culmen has been taken in making the list.
If needed, old and resting actors will be largely adjusted to the list.
The general charge of legislators-cultures is that those people's opinion was not taken in making a list of manoean.
The name of people who came much later than other groups has been recorded in the list while many important activists have been neglected since the days of the Samata Party.

Is the high class of Europe willing to do business with Britain?
In April the Business for Britain was launched and it was promised to bring business together and determine what changes we want to see in connection with the U.K.'s Employment EU.
For him, we organized the largest and most detailed surveys of Britain's professional leaders, asking them what their views on Britain's business with E.U.
U-Gow for the idea of 1000 business leaders, who are representatives of Britain's business size, territories and places.
The findings of this survey can be surprising to many people.
We found that a large part of the businesses now wants to export out of Europe, and focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while the EU member countries are being speedless.
They want the government to privatize new commercial relations with countries like China, India, and Brazil, not to interfere with the long-term and ill-fated process of the reform of EU.
When asked about specific policy areas such as one-right regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that control of these qualifications should come back to Westminster.
The general discontent could be seen very easily by taking the single market, businessmen say that the price of the regulation of Brussels, is far more than the benefits of becoming part of the commercial sector of Europe - even the vast businessmen who were traditionally parties to the European companies, 40 percent of this was agreed on.
In the end and most obviously, our survey of professional leaders found that, a large part clearly wants Britain, to move forward on the course of trade-based alliance and change rather than politics with the E.U.
This conclusion, which was seen in the levels of major business groups, showed that businessmen are prompting to a "article change", which would provide the U.K. with its lost power to return.
It has a very high price - the issue of making a treaty change for Britain and a better deal in not-for-consegregate, changed 16 percent in favor of being stuck in the E.U.
The Prime Minister should not be in any doubt: it is a survey condition that Britain's businessmen support their plan to talk on the terms of Britain's membership in the E.U.
It also showed that businessmen, expecting the current power balance to make a meaningful change to the U.K. side.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and very quickly it is becoming essential, as the eurozone is moving forward in the direction of the transitional, the transitional economy, and the capital union.
Prior priority must, as the findings of our survey show that for businessio means a new focus on business and the basic change in the regulation of brascelets.

Kenya's press cry on disputed media law
The newspaper challenged the legislature as unconstitutional, saying "It's a scary place, and it's valid to ask: What is to stop the freedom of the judiciary by the parliament in the coming yesterday?"
The Provisional Director of the Capital Group - which is Kenya's most prominent independent radio station and news website CapitalFam.,'s managing director Cyrus Kamau said that "the law is cruel and very sentient, we reject it."
He said that the new media tribunal "always will remain biased, because it is the only member of the government" and said that the ban on subject matter and advertising, damaging Kenya's location in the global economy.

This legislature, in September, is being passed on as a means to strengthen national security after it was attacked by an Islamic gunman at the Westgate Shopping Mall.

The Court has blocked action on the New York Police Department's suspension and play policy
On Thursday, a federal appeals court required a judge's order for the New York Police Department's suspension and play program blocked the changes and removed the case from the case.
U.S. Circuit Court Courtpiel 2 And judge Shira Schunderer has said that the judge's decision resulted in an appeal by the city of Uttar Pradesh.
In the judge city it had ruled in August of a violation of the constitution out of its program of preventing people and questioning.
The city's police department also includes the decision to assign a oversight to assist in its policy and training program changes associated with it, its findings and its treatment order.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments on Tuesday on request travel.
The Court of Appeal has said that because he agreed the requirement for a judge to avoid the presence of bias in part of a series of media testimony and by the public he should be removed from the wrong-doing code for the U.S. judges so the judge's case should be removed from the case, to be publicly answered to criticize the court of statements.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the rights of the people's citizens by mistaking black and Hispanic men with its suspension and play program.
He has appointed an outside monitor to oversee major change including economic reforms in policies, training and supervision, and he is most closed where some have ordered a pilot for body-paed testing in the area.
In August, New York City whose cases dismissed after a police halt agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of those people.
An oral argument on the city's appeal is scheduled for some time after March 14, 2014.

A supporter of changes to the NYPD's suspension and play program has said that inappropriate behavior will end a more reliable and effective police force and that other police may influence the use of the policy.
Protesters say changes will reduce police engagement, but will solve a problem with a police force under pressure after hundreds of thousands of officials during the past decade.
The judge has noted that the suspension and playout did not hold the end, which is constitutional, but had improved the implementation of the NYPD's stop.
After the general election, the new government continued to stop selling kerosines, no shops in half a dozen states would be mined.
States in which the sale of kerosine is to stop includes Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh.
In addition to these, there is also preparation to stop the sale of kerosin in some states in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and the East.
According to sources from the Ministry of Petroleum, it will be decided to stop selling kerosine at PDS shops in two grounds.
The first base is then being quickly made of power connections in rural areas.
The second base is the LPG connection.
That is, the sale of PDS kerosine is being stopped in place of which most rural families have been given kitchen gas connections.
The Ministry of Petroleum has made punitive preparations about this.
Since October, 2013, sales of PDS kerosin have already ceased in Delhi.
According to sources, it is under this policy that Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh have been considerably reduced to Kerosin quotas.
The five-dollar quota was reduced from 2.72 million kilo litres to one million kilo litres.
In the allocation of the eruption, 70 percent of Haryana's Kerosin quota was reduced to about 40 percent.
Despite this cut, there has not been news of Kerosin's keros from these states.
The ministry is assuming that it is clear that the kerosine is being used for evaporation.
There is a difference of $37 at this time in the price of PDS Kerosin and Diesel.
This promotes those who do so.
In the states where the PDS's sales will be stopped, oil companies will sell kerosine at the open market at the whole price.
At this time, oil companies are losing more than $39 per litre on kerosine.
In 2013-14, the burden of kerosine subsidy is estimated to last about $31 thousand million.

Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York comedy celebration: The New Yorker
People can argue about that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in the United States: About a hundred years ago the songwriter Frank Fe, who acted as a master of the festival at the Palace in Broadway, started to direct the people to dance in the manner of conversation.
Fe's research has expanded over the years, most recently, at the New York Comet Fosstal.
This festival, composed and run by the founding of the Standardup Institute of Cardlines, this festival this year its 10th anniversary, including over sixty shows in the small club and larger theatre.
Hersh says, "Most of the airlines appeared in the airlines, and became huge success, to the level where they became too big to be played at the club."
We created this celebration as a way to continue to act with them.
This year's program includes the presence of, the presence of the Vanda Psyx, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mahar, as well as the annual music and comedy benefits for military servicemen in the Madison Squoyer Garden, "Stand Up Heroes" which included Bruce Springstein, John Stuvert, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.
As well as the expanding of the festival, the world of comedy has been extended.
Many comedians who have participated in this year's celebration have come from non-Permanent mediums, such as come to the upcoming shows on small networks such as Comedy Sentrell, F.X. and Spike.
Nick Kroll, dip-catable sitcom (F.X.'s respectively Ronchy Fantasy-football theme "Di League") reached the lead, and is now their own comedy Central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been the cast membrane of "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", even though they are best known for their viral video series "Marsal the Shell Wid Shuge".
Along with Crowls and Slate, other young comedians with different voices (the differently frustrated voice Anthony Jesselnik, felony, centered on ethnicity, Kmade Bell) are the products of the decentralized world of the American comedy.
Among the most prominent attractions of the festival, a witness: Speaking to Larry David of David of David:
Steinberg had begun working as a standup comedian, but they have become nomadic television and film directors, as well as unauthorized comedy historians.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show called "Sit Down Comedy Wid David Steinberg" on TV Land.
This encounter will take place in the center of Manhattan, at the Town Hall.
Steinberg said, "The city is definitely in the comedy D.N.A. of all the works of Larry."
They were telling me that, when he was here, they sometimes went to the street between two buildings, and they thought in themselves that if I were to lose my money, I used to be here.
Go ahead of soil, rivers, and forest to provide free medical service
Dr. Georges Well, arriving free health services in rural areas of Cameroon
Well and their crew see hundreds of diseases on almost every weekend
There is not much medical in West African countries; there is just a physician for 5,000 people
Give your vote here or via mobile
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 chiefs of C.N.N. in 2013.
You can vote for them or in the other top 10 to make C.N. the leader of the year.
The winning person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his sick father come to his senses and unconscious, going to the hospital, who were not properly accomplished to help them.
Jamel Well, in 1981, was injured in a car accident near the capital of Cameroone.
In the beginning, only their hands were broken, but an infection that spread to their brains, and he created the bloodbaud, which affected the rest of their lives.
Georges Well says, "There was no neurosurgeon in Cameroon."
If we had money, we'd take our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Well continued to take his father and round out highly crowded clinics and hospitals and continued to receive whatever treatment he could receive.
Well said, "It's not easy."
You get out of the house at 5 a.m. than the hope that you'll be the first person to get to the hospital, but that's not what it doesn't.
There's a lot of sick there.
Some people can join in the mouth of waiting and dying.
The situation did not change much since Well's father's death in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one physician for every 5,000 person in Cameroon.
If compared, there is a physician for every 413 individuals in the United States.
And even if there are doctors there, many of Cameroon's residents can't afford him.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and about two thirds of the practice that is in health service in the country is private sector.
Well says, "His only problem is poverty."
And because they are poor, they can't enjoy their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his father and his countrymen, Well decided to settle something.
Dr. Georges and his crew of volunteers have conducted 700 free surgery last year.
They also became doctors themselves, and began working as a vassal surgeon at the Center Hospital in Jinde.
And they started the non-profit organization Essowym, which goes to rural areas on the weekend to provide free medical service.
Since 2008, he and his ownsaves have assisted about 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday they and about 30 people sit in the van, bind medical supplies to the roof and go to rural areas where people need medicine.
Sometimes the species doesn't even happen to them.
They have to move the vehicle more than once from rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they really have the honor of the chiefs: the feast, the singing and the best housing that can be offered by the community.
These villages have the reason for really celebrating free medical service, and Well - with their great smiles and endless energy - including happiness.
The next morning their crew begins meeting hundreds of patients.
Well said, "We're meeting 500 people on each trip."
They come from about 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
All of these weekend clinics provide a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, diabetes, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may find a gift, donated glass or free birth certificate -- this document needs to be in school but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening, the group performs simple surgery with local cognition.
Operations are generally performed at school houses, town halls or at home; after the process, the disease goes to a place that is moving, and makes room for the next person.
The group's orbits publishes in the operating room and the sanitizing instruments, and the Wells and their partners on Sundays, and they get up early in the morning.
It is waist-breaking speed, but village musicians generally help keep the crew inspired.
Well said, "They keep playing drums all night to keep us alive and continue our work."
On Sunday their crew returns back to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group - including Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - have 700 free of surgery last year, and they know that their help can change the world they help to those who help.
One person stated that he would be able to go back to work because he was receiving free Hernia surgery.
The person said, "This will change the future of me and my family."
In addition to running weekend clinics and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Well also works at the private medical clinic around Undea at night.
He stated that it is their second job that comprises 60% of their non-profit work; the rest of the share is met by private donations.
In Philadelia, the second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelia and in Well's group, Katie O'Mally, said, "I don't know when they sleep."
They are always in either hospital, or are attempting to earn funds for their organization, so that they will continue to run these campaigns.
Students of medicine and nursing such as O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe to join the campaign of Well have this experimental opportunity, which they can never get in their country.
O'Mally said, "In the kind of medicine we help Dr. Well in catching tools or cleansing blood spots, we are able to get experimental experience."
You'll never have the opportunity to do that as a second-year medical student in the United States.
Teenage students generally drill from themselves to get to Cameroon, and they often come with the medical supplies of donations.
But after they have arrived, they will come and go, and the cost of instructions take up well.
O'Mali says, "There's no doubt they're hero."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon is never to end.
For Well, almost the same job is not difficult.
Help other people live happy lives, fulfill the promise made to their father, these are the things that give them a lot of joy.
Well says, "I'm so happy when I do this."
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll be watching what I'm doing.
I'm doing it to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February
The Vatican has announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will create the Catholic Church's new cardinal for the first time in his term on February 22.
The Cardinals, Catholic Church, have the highest rank priests, their position only below the Pope, and that is the people choose the Pope, so Francis will necessitate the first group of their persons, who will eventually choose their successors.
There are now a total of 201 Cardinals.
By the way, after arriving at the age of 80, the cardinal would not be allowed to attend the Pope's election - it comes to a group of 120 "Cardinal voters".
In a speech announcing the news, Vatican's spokesman, Father Fedrico Lombardi, said that before the new cardinals was pronounced, all existing cardinals will be held, which the Pope-stalgament calls.
Lombardi said, "Pop Francis has already decided to state his decision to organize the post-presidentship of February, in order to make it easier to plan other meetings with cardinals from different countries in the world."
Jack Vallero of Catholic Vysage said that by February the number of cardinal voters was likely to decline.
He said that the popes in general, the number of cardinal electors is less than 120, as many cardinals, and declare the name of the Cardinals over 80 years of age as their wishes.
Valero said that, next year's pop-to-pealing would be important, as it would be the first pop-content after Francis was elected in March of this year.
There is currently a kind of prejudice towards Europe and especially Italy.
He said "It would be interesting to see if the new popes, even from the rest of the world, to establish a balance purn.
Forty percent in South America are Roman Catholics, but their number is very low in the Cardinals.
The Cardinals parish by Francis - which is a group of eight cardinals from around the world whose work must be sought ways to improve the church, will also be the first to be selected after being formed.
Its first popes would decide all things on their own.
Valero said, "Now Francis has chosen these eight Cardinals to assist him."
He said that it's such a "probably" to ask for advice from Francis Cardinals.
But we haven't been in this situation before - it's absolutely new.
Valero said that the Pope generally gives the position of cardinal to the bishop of large places, but Francis "are going to be fully surprised - so we don't know whose name they will declare."

A government discussion letter was issued today, former Labor M.P. Maxine McQ, condemning the government's wordedum about foreign workers, said today that it could anger Australia's neighbouring countries.
He told the Americas India Institute today that "the foreigners are arriving at the end of the queue' and that the "the Australian people's how jobs before" are strongly repeated at a time while the Union has had a safe labor market demand."
Historically, its motive was that white workers should have been given protection - and if some in the area saw the sound of that historical testimony, I wouldn't be surprised.
