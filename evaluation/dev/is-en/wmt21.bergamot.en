Only to have a while with the children in the garden is something that never forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance, and of course, the precious time they received with their parents.
Run a boat after tenth class
I don't think we are not a number of sailors working in the national theaters, says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who pursue coastal fishing in the summer, while at the University of Iceland during the winter.
Coastal fishing is a very pleasant summer vacation when you are studying.
If you are well fish, you can earn good income, and I'm wonderful to let a student's loan be allowed.
The year, I also work well into the winter, says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25 - year - old psychologist, who is engaged in coastal fishing in summer, as in the past summer.
Axel was a new blow to the point of view when a journalist approached him late in the beginning of the week.
I took commands for boats less than 12 feet [12 m] long, and I bought my boat in the summer after I finished high school.
I have been fishing on my boat all summer since then.
I bought the ship used by my acquaintance, Hartmann Jónsson, and I had his name name.
When I bought the boat and stopped to go to the sea, he was very pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat, says Axel, and adds that he bought the boat every three million.
• I signed a contract with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, while the other half at the end of the summer when I had catched.
So at the end of this first summer my boat, I had the boatless debt.
How, though, could a boy have one and a half million to pay out a boat when he had just finished high school?
• I had laid down and collect money, I had been working with Dad to the sea when I was a boy, all summers were catching with him and got my share.
I also put my four - price in my boat fund.
Axel was born in Icefirth, from which all of his mother's family is, but he has lived in Cologne since his death.
• I can catch here in the western part because I have a legal home with my grandmother in Icefirth.
I learned in this area from the west of rows with Dad.
I went between the distances, as I feel, for this fishing area covers all the Westfirths.
Although I feel best to be on the west, I have also given the Snowfellness and the rest of the world.
I have also given to the south, but I've just finished gray - leaving, says Axel, who always robs one of the chimneys in the morning and sometimes says that he talks to the habit of sleeping and singing for the sky, in the one - in the corner of the peninsula.
The URL is good at sea, so I can phone, listen to a stack television series and music.
I don't feel that there's a matter on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid getting into trouble, but surely there has been some time to do with weather, but never there is a great danger, saying Axel, who is lucky with the fact that he is never a sea.
He tells tells the length of the day's work, depending on how the fish walks each time.
• In the coastal fishing, I am never more than 14 hours of fishing in one time, but I have also been fishing in other systems, such as the rental quota, but I have been in a continuous one and a half hours in feeding at sea.
The plan for coastal fishing is said to be a fishing vessel of 770 pounds [770 kg] a day, which he finds in hammers.
• Other restrictions are that I must not catch Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I may only catch twelve days a month, the four months spent on coastal fishing, in May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their fishing days after the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary press is to row rather than have 48 days over the summer and can choose for their head.
So the regional division could also be used for me because of the seabed and sea space that are well located at the fishing grounds, says Axel, which reduces the most extensive salted seas on its coastal fishing, as well as only necropsoms and other floats with.
Axel works during the winter season with the University of California at the University of Nuremberg.
• I don't think we are many sailors who work in the local theater, saying that Axel proudly says that he was only going to work temporarily in the theater.
• I was trapped because I feel that this is a lucrative job.
I hope that the psychology study will be useful to me at the future stage of the school, saying Axel, who is also well educated in business science.
Error recording prevented Homepathy
In the case of a person who lives in the country, a crime in which a person resides in the country was not called back to sampling.

One of the most positive ones arrived in the country on 15 July, two days after the rules of so - called home portals came into force.
Those who lived in Iceland are screened on arrival in the country and returned to the country for four to five days later.
It was later revealed that the old system had followed the old system.
The sampling at the border was negative and was not called back in screening for the virus.
In an interview with a news agency, Kamilla Rut Sigfudóttir, a medical specialist, says a conversation with a news agency that this is the result of error in the electronic record sheet.
Tool people in English are not required to introduce a code number, as is the case in the Icelandic version.
It was primarily intended for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person concerned has not received an automatic invitation to take the sampling.
However, Kamilla says that many people have followed the rules on ignorance, although they have filled the file in English, and in some cases employers have also been alert to send them back to sampling after they arrived in the country.
This will be considered during the week on how to make it easier for people to draw attention to this.
Man is in isolation, and six have been placed in quarantine.
They all go to sampling, but two were beginning to show symptoms.
The three infections are now in operation with the three infected people yesterday, which is largely completed because of two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the sequencing of Icelandic genetic analysis has shown that there is a variety of the coronary virus that have not been found in the past.
In the second case, the band has been focused on Israel, although it is known that the virus that moved to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says that it should be before tomorrow as to where the other virus was coming.
There are currently 15 in isolation according to COVID website.
135 are in quarantine.

In total, 34 are quarantine over the new infections that were diagnosed yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of time that is infecting sport events, and it has raised questions as to whether to maintain such events.
John K. Joan, the Secretary of State for Defence, the Secretary of State for Defence, says it well, as long as people follow the standards and rules.
• We are constantly inculcating to all those who live here that there is a need for individual infections.
We also need to inculcate injurious people who are struggling to see that there are certain rules that need to be followed.
It can be held by Johann.
He says that infection can be prevented by the maintenance of individual infections.
In addition, rules and criteria are kept under review.
• What has to be done, and what the National Guard Department and the National Medical Office are constantly urgently appealing to people, is to consider this individual infection.
Both home and service companies.
People who wash their hands and use sprit.
It prevents infection from moving forward, saying Johann.
• To maintain the good road we were on our side, we need to inculcate in the best way we had so far.
40% of the victims of COVID-19 were illiterate 2
Devon Brumfield heard the phone about how difficult her father was to get the spirit.
Her father had diabetes, and she urged him to seek medical assistance.
The next day, he was dead.

Today, the COVID "K has been violated as powerful as a century, Reuters, by Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease and Research Policy at the University of Chicago.
Physiology is more common among black and southern American origins, which has also been drained from the crown virus.
One of the best defenses for those with diabetes 2 is to control the disease by exercise, healthy diet, and the help of health - care professionals.
However, the crust virus epidemic has made it difficult for many to keep rhutan.
Insulin prices have thus been consumed by some to continue attending work and the risk of being assigned to the virus.
Reuters points out that the U.S. authorities could be aware of the dangers they have indivisible to those who have diabetes 2 may be caused by the virus.

Similarly, new studies suggest that the corrononic virus may lead to the proliferation of diabetesfells.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the link between the crown virus and diabetes.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs, and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many who are diabetes.
In addition, a high level of glucose and lipid in sugar-sensitive fertilised ulcers can produce a true called Ucyan storm storm, as it is called when the immune system fails too hard and attacks the body.
Damaged epithelial cells can also lead to inflammation that can cause a deadly blood clot.
This is a single large pole, says Dela Cruz.
• This is related to all interrelationships.
The news has been corrected.
Urea was offered champagne, and then they left the room.
The couple, Asrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason, were involved in the unusual boss of artist Ragnar Kjartansson to engage in sex in front of a camera for the work of the artist.
• We loved each other, so it was not complicated.
He never forgets when he met his wife and grandparents, Asrúna Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.
• I was very fascinated by her.
It was only natural emission, but it also seemed to me to be quite unpredictable.
And he still seems to be.
Assuring, he also remembers the first meeting regularly.
• I'm always hearing this story.
Just about the weekend, she says that she also was attracted to her first speaker.
• I felt and feel so much screaming around Atli, where I am elephant.
There's a lot to do, and I'm glad of it.

They offered, and met the three-year-found in Snaps, and gave themselves to pass wine, and each of them left the right.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans to appear at Palais de Tokyo in Paris during the autumn.
• He had a multilingual fantastic work called Scenes of culture west.
He described it in a simple way.
Assuring said that he had portrayed the work as a banal and dekaur from the everyday life of the West.
• He had a look of all the sensitivities he was going to shoot, and last he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating.
Senan, whom Ragnar asked to participate was to show a young middle class pair to love a minimal room.
This is the beginning and end of the season, and is told by Atli.
The couple did not know much of Ragnar, although they knew of him and of them, they knew of us and felt fit in this regard.
They said that they did not want to advertise people.
They may feel that they would not get the right people but those who would sexually find themselves out of thwarting for others.
They agreed to think about the matter, but it did not take a long time.
• When we relaxed from Snaps, we said: ' Are we not just to do so?
It was just that way.
I trusted Robert as an artist and his all team, saying Asrún and Atli.

• We had not decided anything about how we should be.
We received some small counsel, but we tried to forget the time and place.
Being unwittingly about what we were doing and for whom we were doing.
It was not played, we just loved each other, so it was not complicated, saying Asrún.
But was this romantic?
• O've, this was a little romantic, and Atli says, and Asrún agrees.
A URI was offered a champagne before leaving the room.
It was small like vacation in a fine hotel in Paris.
The crowd were endlessly aware of the performance of the pair in the work that moved them to the audience.
• When Tomi saw this, he wept, he thought it so beautifully, and Atli told Atli.
• This is as much about the love as the one that is near and the automation, saying that I am a member of the board of directors.
The couple's parents have seen the work, and Atli told him that his mother heard the voice of the son of Reykjavik Art Museum, and then realizes that he was part of the work.
Then she turns back, and goes to the purse in this matter, and Atli says.
Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We had not told anyone that, but my father just sends a message to me and says: Gaman says to encounter the little family in Palais de Tokyo, recalls Ásrún up.
And if the work progresses have deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atla?

Telephone for five years from 2009 onwards
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. Ambassador in Iceland, is in the spotlight of the media after CBS announced in the morning that he wanted the armed guard because he feared his life.
However, it has not been a challenge for the president of the United States to appoint an ambassador to the United States.
Since Carol Van Voorst resigned from the U.S. Ambassador at the end of April 2009, he has been an ambassador for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned from office in a strange situation, but Kast light reported that she should have received the Fouls.
On the same way, she received a phone call from the President of Iceland that she would not be honoured.
After her resignation from Iceland, she taught international relations with the Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor, Van Voorst, arrived in his career.
Somehow it is due to Robert S. Connan had been appointed as ambassador, but then left it.
At the end of his career, Loius Ariega had served in the Foreign Service for decades.
He retired in August 2013 and took office as ambassador to Guatemala.
Then he took another ambassador for an unmanned period.
Robert Barber was approved by the U.S. Congress in January 2015 and was later active shortly thereafter, but no ambassador had been present in the spot for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed, not a diplomat, but had served as a lawyer and a short-lived Barack Obama's electorate.
He retired from office on January 20, 2017, when Donald Trump took office as President of the United States, as well as the traditional set-up ambassador.
Trump's government was unusual for both ambassadors and high officials in the DCC.
Two years later, after two years, Jeffrey Ross Gunter announced his meeting to ask him the news and confirm it to Iceland as ambassador to Iceland.
During his testimony to the congress, he said that he had never arrived in Iceland, but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who is dead, had been broken by Dutch rock.
Gunter is a politically appointed physician, formerly a pureologist in California, and has been prominent in the Jewish group of Jews, the Republican Jewish Jewish Coalition.
Sheldon Adelson founded them, but Adelson is an enthusiastic supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter was active in Iceland in May 2019, but no ambassador had been in the country since the early 2017s, for two years and four months, which is the longest-lived one in the country.
This is due both to how long Trump's government was to appoint people in a key position, as well as in recent years, the U.S. Congress has been accustomed to a great deal of success, including the confirmation of an ambassador's office.
Since 2009, it has been a freeor in Iceland for more than five years.
However, this has not prevented the construction of the Embassy, which recently opened the headquarters of Engteig.
The construction is estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion, but severe safety walls surround the building, and a projected glass is in all windows.
However, it does not seem sufficient to fill the current security official, as he is said to fear his life and has requested the weaponry to have the guard.
Former IBV became a narrator in Iceland - There was a mistake to come to Iceland.
Tonny Mawejje, a former player of IBV, said he had been victim of rasism when he was in Iceland, and that he regrets going to the country.
This is illustrated in an interview with Tonny, which appeared on the soganese apple Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda FC Police team, who played in Uganda's top division.
At the time of his death, he was interviewed with the Daily Monitor, who was involved in his career in Iceland, but he played with IBV, Val, and Thrace in Iceland.
• When I arrived in Iceland, I did not play in the middle as I used to play.
In addition to the team's team's team, he was also with the tortoise the island number I wanted, so I did not get anything from what I wanted, saying Tonny, but he played on the right side of the season with IBV.
As a result of his life in Iceland, he is a rashism.
He says that this is a problem that many black players experience when playing in Europe.
• This happened once to me, but since I did not understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I heard about the matter, and then I asked my friend what the matter was about.
He told me that after I confideated, my adversary had made a rhythm resignation.
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland to Norway, where he joined the Hauge Strait.
There he says that he had made the mistake he sees most.
Tonny had not been able to get to the club at the beginning of the season, but he wanted to play more to get to the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on the loan, but then he went to join Val.
It was a mistake to return to Iceland for loans.
I think that if I had been longer in Norway, I would have had the opportunity I would have received, saying Tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he would probably be able to go further.
He wanted the loan to Iceland to have made the dreams of getting into a large army in Europe.
Meetings in the neck of a woman
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 50 -8 smuggle black worms in the necklace of a woman who searched for it.
Doctor was able to drag the worms out of the force.
A study revealed that it was a parasite.
SNN explains this.
The woman had previously eaten sashimi, which are thin pieces of meat.
The woman quickly improved after the worms were removed, but parasites such as these are often eaten raw meat or fish.
After the extinction of the population in the West, the number of parasites has increased, according to CNN.
Fear that another wave is beginning in Europe
Spain is now focusing on concerns about the other wave of the coronary virus in Europe, but the government has taken action to re-fect the spread of the corona virus epidemic.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been held for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelóna, where the number of infections is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action as a result of the increase in vectors in Spain, but in the United Kingdom all have to go to quarantine from Spain, such as Norway, and France has been warned of travel to Spain.
The number of outbreaks is also increasing again in France and Germany, where governments try to balance the spread of the virus and restore the economy.
However, the situation in Europe is good in other parts of the world, but the incidence of infections worldwide is about 300 thousand per day, but it is most common in America and South Asia.
According to John Hopkins University, the number of people in the virus is confirmed to be 644 thousand people.
Finally, cucumbers The Taiver Becomes Enjoyable
In front of the Toll House in Reykjavík, there is a large and deep hole.
Above the other, there are men with orange helmets.
There is also a large grave.
And more smaller trucks.
The street is closed for traffic.
However, the sidewalk is able to stop many of us, and they now look at works of art from millions of Mexicans and philosophies, as they have never seen it before.
Perhaps they have never seen it before.
At any rate, this does not respect it.
The work has been done so far, especially in front of it, which was always under siege.
There, the people laid, locked the car in a snare and then jumped to care for their errands in the city centre.
The current and multi-channel general area and the smoothness of the city's citizens is a guide to the restoration of the current roadway.
The aim is to allow the mosaic work of the Habiteron of Toll House to enjoy a better view.
The project will be open and where the area is well suited to the sun, it is considered suitable as a residence zone for road users.
The art will be illuminated and the chemical now receives more enjoying its material than before in the 142 square metre surface.
In the area there are also small swarms of fog sprays, some types of water ballads that provide games and provide certain occultities.
In this way, the Reformation is described by the Renaissance City of Reykjavík, which is currently underway.
The constructions of water, heating and electricity supply will be renewed.
Many of them have been born for years, but the waste water layers and cold water layers have since 1925, and have served in the local towns and businesses in the middle of the town.
Once the street will be reopened, carlings can travel backwards.
However, it will become a single hole, and at the same time becomes more calm and more accessible for pedestrians.
According to a report on the Toll House of the Customs Office, the house was in operation in 1971, and its architect was Selenisson.
Because the repair of the building was built, there were 250 square metres glass-free wall surfaces to the street.
The building committee and architect agreed that such a surface would adversely affect the overall strategy, if no specific arrangements were made to adorn the appearance of the house.
The parties agreed to expect that they have a permanent work of art.
At the time, a number of rumours of the rumours of the rumours of the rumours of the rumours of the rumours of
She worked extensively on mosaics in Germany and elsewhere.
It was decided first to contact it before deciding whether to compete for the project.
It has been suggested that the work had to be done at the port, and that the port had been the life of Reykjavík since its construction.
When the artist was discussed, she had to trax the subject of such work.
In agreement, it was agreed that it would be able to obtain drawings and other assistance before leaving the country, as she would work on the proposals abroad.
At the time she decided to return home, she made some suggestions for discussion.
It was agreed without delay to ask her to carry out the work.
At the same time, it was announced that the company would be able to re-enter the United States, and the United States Department of the Interior, and the United States, and the United States, and the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, and the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States,
The company was founded and renovated to the public for the construction of the building, which was later renovated by the owners of the band.
All the work was particularly successful, both by the construction of Helgadóttir and Oidtmann brothers, in the preparation.
It has since been insolently exposed to ice cream.
It took place for two years to perform the work, which was completed and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the completion of the Tollhús Work, at the age of 47.
Causes of other institutions to land
Asmundur Einar Ddason, the Minister of Social Affairs announces that more public institutions will be exported to the country in the near future.
This was said by the Minister of Defence at Bylgina at noon.
Recently, it was announced that the fire field of housing and civil engineering in the north will be moved northward to Sheepcrok in autumn.
Six fire experts are working at the Agency, but none of them intend to accompany the North Agency, and the National Federation of Fire Brigades and ambulance workers have criticized the transport operations.
• I think we should take further steps in this regard.
I'm preparing for further steps in this regard.
A further transport, said Asmundur.
He said that the vast majority of the nation want to see the greater distribution of government agencies throughout the country.
• I think it would be necessary to make further political decisions about the transfer of public service to land, as I was doing with the Hushai and the Construction Institute, saying Asmundur, who also took examples of other institutions that have been exported to the country and were of great importance to local communities, such as the transfer of the Food Agency to Selfoss, the Land Measurements to Akraness and unemployment insurance on Skagastrand.

Do not receive a fine of 27 million dollars per cent of the BTricoin crop
The taxation committee has rejected the requirement of a tax investigator who demands a fine for the lack of his capital income resulting from the sale of Bitcoin's electronics.
The Committee concludes that a tax researcher had not provided clear reasons for why it was necessary to fine the man.
According to the Committee's decision, the tax investigator considered the person to be able to pay a physical interest in the tax returns for the 2016 and 2017.
He would have despised his finance income that arose as a result of sales of 27 million, either deliberately or by a grand negligence.
The faithful should be for his ways.
In a letter to the committee, the man rejected it.
He was killed in 2016 as a result of the sale of electric gold for 27 million.
It would have been acquired by a turbulent period between 2009 and 2010, when it had been easy and undoored in a regular home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the electric cigarette, taxation for such sales was quite unclear and unforeseeable.
It would have been expected that citizens should be aware of such tax returns.
He would not have expected to avoid paying taxes on the harvest and would have explained his property as a deposit on foreign exchange account.
He had been involved with both skilled and taxpayers about how this was done, but without success.
He believed that he had not been born nor raised in Iceland, and that he had lived for a few years when he began digging for Bitcoin.
So he would have been in a worse position than others to introduce complex rules that the taxation authorities had not developed a clear view.
Thus, the man felt that his tax for these two years of income would be re-established and pressures, but otherwise he would not be punished.
He was a member of the Icelandic government, and had paid taxes in the country since 2012.
He would never have expected to unap off his duties.
The requirement for a fine would be out of all time and would be detained in debt.
The question of this man understands what a footman is.
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been very close to the teeth, but it is also fascinated by the progress of his career with Breiðablik in Pepsi Max.
They are in the fire line during the evening when they receive an ice line at Station 2 Sport.
This is due to the fact that the game was not played in the game, and does not meet the game with a new pup, such as in the summer games.
He had written Ubla bla, blair, blair, blair, and appeared on the game at HK on Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
• I don't know exactly who he was answering with the payment, but the talk about karakter was doing better.
He did not hide.
He wanted the ball every time, and if someone was going to equal this game, I thought he would do it or make it, and Guðmundur Benediktsson said to the Pepsi Max for the studio, when it came to be a clerk.
• I should be here for the people.
• It is sometimes difficult to discern the position in which he is.
He is looking out on the left side of the game, but he has a very free rust in the team, and said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Thorkel Máni Pétursson tells Brynjf a serious entertainer and rejoices to get a small man in the department: "There is no one that it is a karakter.
It's funny deeper, and I love it with your hair, and to be always ready to meet and answer in interviews.
It is incredibly busy with him, who tells me that this man understands what a footman is.
• I'm a entertainer.
I'm going to be here for the people and to enjoy it.
The people are reading the interviews at Brynjf, and people are paying in and observing what is next to his hair.
This man is just a genius, and Morni said.
A player of the team said that he wants to leave the club - and I have been in contact with several teams in the B-Federa division.
Tobias Thomsen, Player of the Pepsi Max, seems to be on the move.
According to the Danish medium Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
The case also included the problem.
Tobias wants to reach the beginning of the period in the country, but he has to resign his contract with KR, where the Danish department begins before that date.
The Society knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me a great understanding, U.S. told Tobias in a conversation with Bold.
• I have been in contact with several teams in the B division, and it will probably change before the end of the Icelandic period.
There are not many teams in Denmark who can pay up my contract with KR.
He is said to have been a member of the group, and that he would probably have to take a downward of the company's debts.
The U.S. Supreme Court has been able to achieve a higher level of economic impact than in Iceland.
The heartttle bjartmar has recovered wheels for millions - The responses are now answered after the discussion of DV
For more than a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had a special interest in most others.
He raises up and saves lost and stolen bicycles, electric bicycles, and spines.
The name is derived from the name of the motorcycle, which has been used as a result.
In time, there was a great ecstasy when a person published a record of his relationship with Bjartmar.
In the United States, it was reported that the city's population was located on the east side of the story, and that the film was released on the same site, and that the film was not the same as the Bjartmar.
It was not possible to read from the original electronic writer's writings, but that Bjartmar has thieveted him.
It has now been changed to Facebook and the headline of the original DV updated by the original DV.
It is not clear what happened in the East.
Bjartmar said that he had received information from an electric victim that it was truly an electric torgile.
This information was obtained by the owner from others, but the information was falsely stated.
• I saw the garage, and I looked at the stern, with information that it was an electric spider that had been missed for a very long time and was looking for.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him prepare to drive to the stern, I decided to talk to the man.
The owner was confident in his case, and I decided to have a conversation with the husband.
In general, I go very much finely, but before I was able to finish what I had said, the man had taken away from me.
Biart says that the man in the electric field has as invited him to show him the intellite for the wheel and has called the police.
• Yea, floatt, "Bjartmar," said Bjartmar, just get it on clean.
As a result, the owner of the electric cigarette proved the ownership of his electric shoe and unwrought.
Later, the rights of the electric industry recorded on Facebook, as reported in the previous report.
During this year, Bjartmar has pursued this practice, saying that he can count the times he landed on the side of another finger.
• I have had peaceful relations with the most difficult men in Reykjavík, saying Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycles are often the smallest brothers and sisters of society, addicts, mentally ill people, and other people on the street.
Unhappily, the feminine master is a hardworking man, and some way must be financed, unfortunately, theft of such liquidity is easy to achieve that goal, says Bjartmar.
• My relationship with these people is, in effect, so good that I have many good people with me.
For example, people have been treated and then turned to me and help me what I'm doing, he says.
In general, Bjartmar's communication with bicycles are polite.
Some know of him and what he is doing and offer peacefully to show him the rings, the position number of the wheel, and so forth.
A carnivorous thievery is a big problem that has not been discussed.
In addition, Bjartmar says that the police are even more interested in talking to him with stolen bicycles.
It is not clear from the previous news movement DV, saying that he does not be one of the self - appointed police in a personal search for justice.
However, asked if he is not at the height of his actions, and whether this is not the first and foremost role of police, Bjartmar says that it is so true.
The truth is that the law does not do so, but the fact is that the law is simply not to be done.
For example, I have watched policemen drive away from a large pile of stolen wheels.
It is said to be unfounded in these matters.
• When the law is not doing anything in this, and it's just before your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this issue, why not ask Bjartmar.
He said that he had been so successful in having on the stool wheels, that at times he encounters on his skirts on the street that they had just the wheels they had once recovered.
The time that Bjartmar has called for police assistance, it has been suggested that it simply does not exist.
• This is not just working with the police, and it isn't I to blame, and it's not the owners of the bicycles to blame, Bjartmar, and it is thought that the victims of bicycles stealing have to suffer the emptiness of the police in this area.
The performance of Bjartmar is not shared.
In many places, stories of people thank Bjartmar for having reached their possessions back.
Biartmar has long lost the number on a number of bicycles he has returned, but the amount of money is running on millions, if not millions.
The road there electric motors, electric wheels, and electric shafts heavy, but the electric bicycle may cost up to half a million.
It is a day at a high school, and every weekend he works on a partnership.
So his bicycle search is unpaid who is working for his free time.
Pension funds and long shadows
In 2019, he was a member of the Icelandic National Gallery.
It was later revealed that the castle was destroyed by fire from 19th century. a century, but in 1919 a pension fund was established, which eventually became a pension fund for all civil servants.
The basis for the current pension funds of general employees was then laid down by a plenary collective bargaining agreement in 1969, which provided for a credited employment pension fund and a valid fund collection from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were enacted on the basis of these agreements, and the pension scheme continued to grow thereafter.
The Pension System of Workers was not the only radical change that contributed to the labor movement by its social struggle.
Unemployment insurance had been similarly acquired in history novels in 1955, as well as the organization gradually obtained its standards of sickness and sickness fund, substantial holiday rights, reduced working time, housing improvements, and other matters that are widely exchanged.
All these rights were highly and severely struggled, but proved to be a more conservative, much more and more permanent benefit than the increase in the number of the people in the pay layer, which disappeared as hard as the hurricane of inflation that characterized the period after war and until 1990, as many remember.
The sponsor of the membership of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although it was eventually agreed that the funds would be owned by a fund company, the union movement agreed that their governments should be appointed representatives of employers and fund members to the same extent.
In the following years after the establishment of the funds, the majority of the members of the fund's management were often criticized for discussing employees' organisations, but it was never achieved, so we still have an unnatural arrangement that the representatives of fund members do not have a majority in the management of the funds.
In Article 36 of Law No. 129/1997 on the compulsory insurance of pension rights and activities of pension funds deal with the investment policy of the funds.
It states in point 1 that the pension fund shall have the best interests of members.
Also, paragraph 5 states: "A pension fund shall set ethical criteria for investment.
In the shareholders policy of the Pension Fund for Traders, the following provisions are, inter alia, following the aforementioned legal provisions:
The Pension Fund is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on responsible investments, as well as many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the west and in Europe.
The rules discuss how environmental and societal priorities as well as the good governance of enterprises can contribute to improving the investment performance of portfolios.
Thus, the interests of investors and society's goals are in a broader context.
LV considers it important that companies, in particular those listed on a stock market, have a public policy: to exercise good governance remuneration of societal responsibility and the environment.
The pension fund, which has the largest funds in the country, has established a policy of responsible investment, which provides a similar provision.
This is all the way to the introduction to the most recent fashions of the Icelandic language, the "Southern."
Since the word is used, it is not hoped that it has been fully defined, but I now feel that the following definition is "may" when a caste manager in a trade union says that he intends to send the representatives of the company to a pension fund or to instructions on how to take sides in a particular case.
If they do not comply with the recommendation, they will be removed from the Administrative Board in the first position.
If the head does not deal with this in the media and does not speak of dismissal, it is not a turbulence, since, of course, communication between people in the world, as elsewhere is a matter of communication.
I make the reader to think about who he feels more frightening.
There are two people who have tried to shape this definition when it is written, on Saturday, July 25, 2020.
He is a journalist and a member of the board of directors of the board of directors and editor-in-chief.
The case was followed by Bogi Nils Bogason, the director of Icelandair had stated that the company's agreements with airwifers and air servers (as they up), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, the chairman of the Versaille Society of Versailles, the company's representative in the management of the Pension Funds of Traders did not support the possible acquisition of shares in the company, or may have been compromised.
A few years later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, and then Ragnar Þór made the same way with his recommendations, which, of course, aimed at Boga's decision.
However, they saw Horður and Asgeir's reason to talk about the matter in the Friday newspaper, with a large number of statements on ascertain control, criminal, and a strong need for changes in law.
Surely you had little to think about a heavy belwind, although blessed the practice, and it was also accelerated quickly.
Since the matter is important, let us consider the matter itself at last.
I set out above the details of the pension funds that are involved in this matter.
They include the need for members of the fund and have ethical criteria for investment, and these issues are elaborated in the statutes of both the law and the Pension Fund of Traders as I mentioned.
However, Pension funds do not have to look only for short-term profitability in their investments.
This would be a very dangerous policy, and there is no need to look for for centuries as examples of such things in the past, where large loans from banks and funds have gone to immoral adventures and environmental threats, with disastrous consequences.
The editor-in-chief of Icelandair was clearly high when he thought to wipe out a group of employees, thus greatly reducing the favor of the society in Iceland and weakening its position on investors.
Happily, he saw and withdrew it.
The time will show whether it is sufficient for the investment of the pension fund in the company to be considered liable to be liable to the members at the time of the settlement.
The author is a former professor of physics and scientific history.
One of the Infected Permited Absentery
One of the three reported Covid-19 in the country came from the Baltic State on 15 July of the past, about a half weeks ago.
He is not a foreigner who is still in existence in the field, and is not given clear instructions to adhere to the so - called infuse of the arrival of the country and to take a different sampling few days after the arrival of the arrival.
He received negative screening at the border.
He is a member of the Icelandic community, and is actually going to do so, says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, a medical specialist in the field of disease, and a local medical doctor during his summer vacation, in a conversation with the newspaper today.
• He used the English registration form, and it is not mandatory to record the identity number, and if the code number is not recorded, you are not automatically announced in the second specimen.
She says that man could use the English registration form because he actually resides abroad, but because of his network in the country that Icelander should have used it.
However, he did not realize this.
• When the code number is not recorded, you need to seek himself to appear in the second sampling.
Neither he nor his employer seems to have realized that it was the right way, says Kamilla.
It is clear that we need to strengthen the information on this while we find some way to make an automatic public service system, although Icelanders do not register their identity numbers.
Or they do somehow more predict who are participants in the Icelandic community in the registration system, and it explains.
Fortunately, however, the country has been a part of the country, although it is defined as a member of the Icelandic community, a member of the Icelandic community.
Only six have been sent in quarantine after he was diagnosed yesterday, and all of these were all in a conversation with him.
They will be sampled, but two of them have begun to show Covid-19 infections.
The man received negative sampling at the border on 15 July.
Kamilla is likely to have recently infected the virus that she could not yet be detected when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out that man has been infected here in Iceland, but not to carry the virus into the country.
It cannot be said that this is no doubt imported infection because it is long since he came to the country that he could have been appointed here like those two who have caused small shorts in connection with the sports events.
It says, though, that it is very unlikely because of the man's ability to renounce.
It is very unlikely, in fact, says Kamilla, but it is not possible to exclude it until the Icelandic genetic analysis has been distinguished from the virus in man.
• If we get a virus depth that has not been seen in the past, it is virtually certain that he has brought it to the country.
Peppers and bombs were applied to countermeasuring agents
There was a conflict between the police and the Protestants in Seattle, the night.
Police used police to hit piping and unnamed hand bombs, while Protestants broke their windows and set fire.
In the United States, there were over 45 policemen, and 21 police officers were injured.
The protests in Seattle were opposed to the protesters in Portland Oregon, and the protests in Seattle were held in Portland Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, there was one protester shot to death.
As stated on the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a building site and broke a window in the city's courthouse.
As a result, the police announced that the protests were overturned, and there were conflicts between Protestants and police groups.
In Colorado, Colorado, was Elijah McClain, 23 years old Black man, who was murdered by police in August of the last year, commemorated by Protestants.
A car crashed through a group of Protestants in the city, but there was no damage.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of black soldiers met together and demanded justice for Breonnu Taylor, at the age of 26 - year - old black woman who was murdered by police in his home in March of the past.
The group carried firearms and joined the congresses in closed intersections, where police related to the group from a group protesters who opposed the protesters and also carried a firearm.
At that time, 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where Protestants remembered James Scurlock, a 22 - year - old black man who was assassinated by a white barbaranda in May.
Solskjær: Not the game that defines our period
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, manager of Manchester United, does not want to minimize the importance of Leicester's play today in the finals of the English Premier League.
If the game collapses, and Chelsea do not lose against Wolves, but Solskjær and his men are ranked 5th place and loses his rank.
However, they still hope to get to the UEFA Champions League by working the European Division next month.
• We have not come to an end.
If we reach Leicester, I think people will say that we have not now had a bad period, Uz, said Solskjær.
• Whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey, for we still have a relatively substantial land with the two teams above us, Uzbekistan told Solskjær.
Clearly, the nerves become at present. At 15 a day, Solskjær tried to make a difference, as if it were a game.
• If you want to belong to Manchester United, you must get the habit of being under pressing in the last game of the period.
This is not new, and the company is based.
We have made a wonderful opportunity to end the period well, and now it is our taking advantage of it, saying Solskjær.
This is not the most important game for the period, but it is only the next game.
You can ask anyone in the soccer team, the next game is always the most important.
The view does not define our period, we have already defined many hours defining this period.
I think we are well - known and I think we are well - off in a better form and much stronger than during the last season, Uzbeocci said Solskjær.
65,000 Infects in the Sun's Circle
65.490 new infections of coronasivir were detected in the United States yesterday according to John Hopkins University.
In all, 4.178.02 infection has been confirmed to the west ocean from the start of the epidemic in that country.

Fear the Second Climate of the Troubles
The government of Spain is now trying to keep the increasing circulation in Spain in Spain.
The Spanish health authorities reported more than 920 new cases of COVID'19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There have been no more information about 24 hours since the beginning of May, and the reports have been reported at the same time as Spain begins to remove one of the most severe exits in Europe.
The bakery rate led to the fact that the British authorities now charge passengers who come from Spain to attend their homes.
To the past, Spain was on the British list of safe kingdoms.
The situation is the worst in Catalonia, northeastern Spain, where governments have taken more restrictions to try to reconcile the growth.
In the capital of Barcelona, entertainment clubs will be closed for the next two weeks, and their houses will be closed at midnight.
It is now in force for over 2,000 inhabitants in the county of Segria in western Katalonia.
It is thought that Britain's decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy that relies heavily on the arrival of foreign travellers and is not successful after the epidemic.
Tui, the largest travel agency in the United Kingdom, resigned all flights planned to Spain and the Canary Islands.
In many parts of the world, government is said to prepare for the second wave of the epidemic, but there seems to be little interest in taking back to a large number of re-introductions in a large number of ways.
For example, Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has taken very badly treated it, and it has been very bad about by nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Jean Castex, Prime Minister of France, has then said that the U.S. film does not survive, economic or socially, if the abolition of the national post was reinstated.
Many people hope to have local means to accommodate the residents of individual towns, cities, or areas, to hold back the virus in the next round if possible.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three national
Three domestically infected national infections yesterday, plus two more border barriers.
Five people with a positive Covid-19 infection in Iceland were reported.

It has been sent to isolation, and sixteen in close association with him in a quarantine field.
He was a member of the board of directors of the University of Reykjavík, and is also a member of the association of sports clubs in Reykjavík, and is only a part of the sports team.
Others sent out in quarantine relate to man in another way.
The origin of this infection is unconscious, and the point of infection is carried out by the National Police Infections.
The ReyCUP International Assembly has followed the guidelines and rules of the PEMS and civil protection that are still in force and that appropriate measures have been taken.
However, pictures of the convention yesterday showed that in a very close relationship, they could be seen to welcome his good work in the field.
Just before 11 a.m., the following announcement on his Facebook page is published.

Patrekfjords tells the area of a book about shopkeepers - Directing visitors to another
The building is completed by the Royal Air Force, which is located on the west side of the building.
When guests are pointing out to look at other accommodation options.
It is named after the West Coast, the West Bank, the Tálknafjord, Melanes on Redasandi, Hótel Flalund and Hótel Breiðavík as a different choice in the position.
It is believed that this is the first time in the history of the United States, and that it is the first time in the history of the United States.
She has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the town.
An attack in the tent area can be judged for good condition in this year, if the weather does not set a bill, but DV said earlier that of a poisonous power.
However, the worst weather on the south can be expected, and hope for the Patreksfirthers.
B.b.is first told that all other accommodations in the town were already full-time.
A full-dwelling building drops down to the best place in the city
The Romanian workers live free of Dunhaga 1820.
While the owner seeks a building license for improvements, the subject of the project has been successful in the system during the third year.
One of the oldest, most important, and most expensive towns in the city of Reykjavík is a three-storey building.
The ground floor of the building is about 600 square feet [600 sq m].
The back of the house is the door of two staircases, each of which contains four long-lived apartments.
They are between 93 and 130 square feet, most of which over 100.
The house has a considerable history.
It was built in 1959, and has hosted the video rentals, the Socostofu, the Dairy Campaign, the Dairy Trade Hall, the camp, the sale of fish, and the last university.
The house, has been worded, and has been remembered for its beauty.
The building is now under severe damage, as shown in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18.
The company's name is derived from the company's company's name, which is derived from the name of the company's other members of the board of directors and the other members of the board of directors.
He was a member of the board of directors, and was a member of the board of directors.
In the United States, the company has a large number of choirs.
The company is a member of the Board of Trustees and her children.
He is also the third-place finisher in D18.
She and her husband, August Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once drove Stálskip to the Stálskip.
In the summer of 2009, the building was purchased, and it has not been in use since then.
For example, in recent years, the condition of the house deteriorated constantly.
Facebook call people in the neighborhood says that the house was very lifeless in recent years.
It may be that owners have been able to get back for several years after changing the house and the property.
Other neighbors say the house for long.
• It is long time to do something general about this spot, and it is boring that it has diminished.
He also says that he is a fragrant to the owners of the house for not being driven to finish it, find some common surface with the neighbourhood of the house, and canceled this primordial cardboard.
This is just in agreement with the community around it, so that it can be escaping and completing it.
The study of the enactuable theory is the organisational process of the field that has been in operation at least since 2017.
It was built in 18 and 20 after the construction of a new building on the current building and behind the house, a new building, and a building on a single floor, as well as a cellar.
The construction permit granted for that project was appealed to the Executive Committee on Environment and Resources, and the Committee canceled it as the project did not support the division structure and proximity representation was not adequate.
The city of Reykjavík began operating with zoning and ended with an advertisement in the Official Journal of the following year.
It was also appealed and the Committee was repealed in March 2020.
At this time, nearly three years had passed since the initial application for building permits and the owners of the house at the start of the house.
At the time, the house had become drowned, and neighbors had been tired.
When DV asked the neighbor of the house to the situation and the reaction of neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some understood the intentions of the house, others did not.
Others directly strayed their anger to the city, others did not.
Others were just angry, but nothing is true of it.
Still others said a freshly shortened apple, but neighbors had a new unusable parking position Dunhaga in 1820.
One complainant in the case said that he was long-term in the administration:
• Whatever we need to pass through the process in three stages, is incredibly unbelievable.
It is as though the city of Reykjavík could not read.
Today the house is empty, abandoned, and is neglected.
A few years later, the city's administrative system, and the most important of the people in the area is the owner and many years of work.
When a journalist carried a garden at Dunhaga 18 spotted the door and trash.
Playstation computer and recent television were on the other side of the earth's other scrapers of the Icelandic people.
It was opened to the University of California, where there were a number of high schools in the United States, and there was a lot of debate over whether or not the school's office is a part of the school's history.
Clearly, someone has made a firm hold of himself at one corner, but no visible.
Some of the philosophies and glaciers, and some pillars of geology sites, which would probably become a book, are confronted with it.
The floors of the building were also open and life on both sides.
A journalist was so successful that the people of one of them were collide.
There were the Romanians to boil the potato dishes in the evening and offered a journalist in.
The club's headquarters are used for the Ztroforce.
They have been there for some time, and the power of DV said that the company has not paid for the building except for heat and electricity.
Because of the condition of the house, it is not easy to collect rents.
It is clear that there have been a number of foreign workers in the past year.
The work of the Covid-19 has not been part of the Covid-19 situation, as a reduction in tourism was reduced in the building sector, and the two bridges were the most effective in using temporary agency services.
Nevertheless, in Dunhaga, 18 people seemed to have enough to do and maintain the work defects, and the co-resversity were exhausted after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the miserable condition of the house, the apartment seemed to be well maintained by the boys.
When a journalist named the boys Romanian bednights, he suddenly became sarcasm clear: On the best place in Reykjavík, a 1,500 square square square square [1,500 sq m] of property.
Owners want to change the house for the better and neighbours want to improve the situation, but they share the definition of recovery.
In the United States, the city's planning area is at the starting points, the victim of appeals, and the opportunity of appeal in the planning process and the suspended case resolution of the Environment and Resources Committee.
In the house, so Romanian workers, perhaps those who are going to improve the situation, may be the ones who stop breaking up.
It was originally published in the newspaper DV on July 17.

The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, will grant 10 million pounds in a campaign against overweight, which will include a ban on instant adjectations, following a serious illness, partly due to his weight.

Women to Better to lead the Changes

There are women, U.S. told Helga.
In Iceland, Uzbekistan is famous for his women's position.
Meetings and how to change.
Since we are only getting involved in these changes.
It was said that it is a turbulent influence on the island as well as in the best parts of the world, in both gender equality and human rights.
• We are not as ready to consider what needs to be done.
As the Germans are keenly aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
It's a cave.
We must know where we are coming and know the story and listen.
List of voices of edgepoint groups.
We do not have the same rules here, and said Helga.
She said that she was a good woman in Iceland, but she added that, like many other parts of the building, the islanders were of immense value.
She said that the political issue was about its own interests, control, and power that were the forces that were inconvenienced in all societies.
It is now a list of people who have been involved in this group, and who have only been involved in the development of the United States, and that the United States has been in a state of emergency, and that it would not be possible to find out if they were able to do so.
• It is the feminine value that we are thinking about it.
From human rights and conservation, cooperation, and that all of us actually sit at the same level, saying that the above value was the basic values of the new Constitution.
• We are a very rich country of natural resources, and it is absurd that there are people living in poverty.
It is absurd, and we can change differently, and said Helga.
• It is absurd that women's work is always lower.
It is absurd that airwidth and nurses need to be in a collective struggle just to reach a decent wage.
It can be signed by the signatory list of the new constitutions here through Iceland's electronics.

Tocks in quarantine and some of them show the symptoms of the disease caused by the corononic virus
Five people have been aware of the national Korean virus in the last three days, most of the infected ones are unrelated.
Tens have come in quarantine because of this, and some of them have begun to show the symptoms of the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the coronary virus nationally yesterday and two to border tournaments.
According to a geographer, a growing number of domestic infections do not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading widely in the community.
• It has been ranked from the previous domestic infection, and it is a virus that has not been seen here in the past, so we have no special reason to think that it has been hidden in society for some time.
This is probably something that has just started to the country, but, of course, we need to be very careful today, and Kamilla Sigríð Josephsdóttir said, a specialist in the area of a geographer.
Most of them have been infected with individuals who came from abroad.
Further sampling takes place in the next, but some in the community who were in contact with the infected people have begun to show the characteristics of the coronary virus.
• It is now not in the process of influenza, reminding us of other respiratory infections, so we can be somewhat liberal by doing these tests on individuals who, during the influenza era, had found a reason to do something else, saying Kamilla.
The infection is largely completed, but it is not precluded that more people have to go to quarantine.
After attending sports events, two of the infected were diagnosed.

The Secretary of Civil Protection Department reports as much as possible as long as people adhere to criteria and rules.

• If it does not go more to isolation from these individuals after being encircling at these sports events, we can claim that our anti-competitions has worked.
But it is not revealed, Uz said Kamilla.
The civil protection crisis is under constant review.
• We need to be ready to intervene with further counsel or restriction if it seems necessary, saying Kamilla.
A few weeks are about to be extended to a thousand people.
This new situation could affect relaxation.

Not revoked until after voting
It is not clear whether the air raids of Icelandair, which will take effect by the next month, will be withdrawn.
An electronic vote for the Icelandic Airfreoan Federation on behalf of Iceland's airfrurship in Icelandair ends on the night of the following day.
The company's editor-in-chief, Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, says that Icelandair will not make a decision on the facts until the decision of the vote is in place.
• This is cleverly hanged together, and Godlaug Liney tells Liney.
• There have been no redundancies, this must be done in such a way that the machinery can be used.
Of course, people are eager to know if they will be with work after the month's end.
It is signed for a week's contract, one night of July 19.
It is expected to remain valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on a contract previously cancelled by air carriers.
On 17 July, the government and the Security Council of Iceland agreed to sign a total of private work stations in Icelandair, the members agreed to vote.
This was not the case, but it was decided that the airfield would be relocated to the Air Force, and that all its air carriers were relocated to the United States, and that it would not be possible for the company to continue its operations.
The team's pilots were able to take up the task of a temporary visitor.
The question of how she believes that the vote will go, Godlaug Liney, makes it difficult to say about it.
It is believed that the company was in a state of emergency, and that all of the airline's pilots were forced to retire from the company, and that the airfields were relocated to the United States.
It is now revealed whether it affects it.
At the end of April, Icelandair aired at the end of April, with a total of 900 percent, about 95% of them.
Their period of notice is different, with the shortest working life he has three months and ends in the July month.
It has about 90% of the island's air carriers.
What will the contract not be accepted?
• We wish to continue discussing our associates.
With this agreement, we are meeting the demands of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the aircraft is too long.
A referendum on a collective bargaining agreement ends, and Icelandair introduces the settlement of the second quarter of the following year.
A new contract was held at 12 p.m. on the morning.
Icelandair's resolution for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but the preliminary results of the project indicate that the company's revenues have decreased by 85 percent from the same period in the previous year.
An electronic vote for the Icelandic Airfrholder Association and the Association of Icelandair's Association began on Wednesday, July 22, and ended on Monday, July 27, 12 o'clock.
Those who are entitled to the agreement are Icelandair's employees who pay social fees to the Airfr Island Society.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new collective bargaining agreement on Sunday, but Friday, Icelandair had terminated the negotiations with the Society after a first round of the FA Cup in the first July.
In the following year, Icelandair had told all the pilots and pilots of the company on Friday, but they were withdrawn after the signing of a new collective bargaining agreement.
According to a new collective agreement, airfrurs must fly five hours a month for the same basic wage.
The Convention is valid until 2025, which has been integrated into the provisions of pilots and airwife on how long you can fly on one watch.
The agreement was announced to members of the FFÍ at a meeting at the Hilton Nordic hotel on the last Monday and described many airwifers that were discussed by the news agency in a state of dissatisfaction for the purpose of the agreement.
Most, however, seemed to agree that the contract would have to be accepted to keep FFI alive.
Icelandair's resolution for the second quarter will be introduced tomorrow, but the ECIT of the company, the result of its financial resources and taxes, is the result of a preliminary business resolution of 100 to 110 million dollars, or about 15 billion dollars.
Icelandair sent a provisional calculation of the last Wednesday, where it said that the company's revenues amounted to about 60 million dollars in the quarter, or about 8.3 billion dollars.
The amount of money and its equivalent was 154 million dollars at the end of the quarter, around 21 billion dollars.
Icelandair also aims to offer the company's capital in August.
Icelandair was intended to complete contracts with fifteen creditors, the government and the Boeing an aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before the end of the month.
New Variant rather than a new type of virus
A new virus means that this has been a person who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been done here in the country, says Már Kristjánsson, a chief medical doctor in the National Hospital's Episcian Diseases, reports that a new type of virus has been detected in this country.
Three domestically infected nationalized regions yesterday and two at the border.
One who was diagnosed had participated in the Rey Cup football club, but the origin of the infection and infectivity was over.
There was also a person who came to the country on 15 July, and there are two members of the union with him to show the symptoms of COVID'19.
In addition, it was reported in the U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. virus List of species of virus that has not yet been detected here.
Infectious oppression has been completed in connection with that infection.
It may be noted that there is no new virus, but it is the same that it has spread worldwide, namely the new coronary virus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more appropriate to refer to a new variant of that virus than to a new type of virus.
The question of what it means and whether it could say something that another wave of epidemic has begun, Már says that as is a case, and it could be so far from it.
• However, if there are cases in which there are no foreign relations and have the same genotype as this particular variety, then the conclusion [about the second wave] could be drawn, but it is premature to explain, Már.
Happiness in the hot pot
Is the secret of the happiness of Iceland in the hot pots?
The BBC's program's program's program's program's program's program designed to provide a similarity in the form of a popular television series.
The Icelandic bathing is a special world, and it is claimed that no one in the world is as many bathrooms per population.
The natural land area is its foundation, but also the tradition of swimming here.
Children's trade was legal in 1940, but older citizens are no less active in exploiting the hot water for health improvement.
It is described as a fixed part of the general welfare of the land.
All in the pot are equal, regardless of their class and position.
On the cell phone, people talk on personal spots through home and space, or the deadly power of the water: the minding and ejected batteries of the soul and body.
Brats to attend a hundred days in the election
Hundreds of days are held until the United States goes for elections and elects its president for four years.
Donald Trump seeks feedback, but he has the busiest to attend.
Joe Biden, the prospective candidate of the Democratic Party, has a great advantage at Trump nationally, taking into account polls.
According to a new survey of the newspaper, the estimated number of Americans feel that the nation is in a wrong way.
Trump's response to the pandemic of the new coronary virus is also very unpopular, and more Americans believe that the president has been in poor economic matters.
More specifically, only two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right course.
32 percent claim to support Trump's response to the epidemic, and 48 percent say he has kept the economic situation well.
In March, it was a proportion of 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average of FiveThirtyEight, Biden, 49.9 percent is followed by Trump 41.9 percent.
Trump has tried to draw attention from his career as a member of the Biden, promotes so - called cultural disputes and proclaim policies that are intended to be governed by law and order.
However, Biden's offer is eager to keep up with Trump, and it is considered to be very likely to win if Trump is actually concerned with how Trump has been working in the last four years.
Trump's dissatisfaction with Trump also seems to have come down to the Republican Party's parliament, and fears the Republicans that the Republicans could even reach a majority of the U.S. Senate, which has so far been very high.
Politico reported that the days are continued to be a candidate, and that is now the Republican Party would have their greatest success for decades.
The party was particularly successful in the 2016 general election, and it is now apparent that this trend will continue.
In recent years Trump has tried to incite the population to join him, including that the President of the United States will be destroyed by racism and racism.
In addition, Trump has abolished a regulation since Barack Obama's time in the White House, which was intended to increase the diversity of suburban areas.
He then encouraged the U.S. assassination by former Deputy Governors of New York, where she claimed that Biden would destroy the U.S. and Trump underwent.
• Biden will destroy your situation and the U.S. dreams.
I will keep it, and even do it even better!
The United States population is an increasing number of voters.
According to NPR, about half of all voters are in the United States.
From George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has won the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Nemama in 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority of the votes cast from this group, but lost to Barack Obama.
Surveys have shown that despite Trump's ability to secure the majority of the population in the 2016 suburbs, his followers have been greatly reduced.
Although there are different differences between the survey, Biden has been measured with about fifteen percentages of the prerequisites at Trump in the outskirts.

In addition, the Japanese government has increased the cost of delay.
Everyone still keeps the head.
When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan would be the site of the Olympic Games, the testimony of the Japanese representatives was genuine.
They ran and hurled to the exchange, and Tokyo had applied to host the game in 2016 but was accustomed to a lower level for Rio de France.

Yet, no one wants to think about it.
The Olympic Games are not a normal sporting competition.
There is nothing to save, the vision should always be wonderful, and efforts to pull their last games.
The city's capital is based on the evaluation of the city's promotions.
The more grandparents of the race is, the more likely to be ignored.
It was estimated that 150 million dollars will be allowed to host the 2016 Summer Olympics, or more than 20 billion dollars.
At the time of the election, 75 million dollars were about ten billion dollars, the show was relegated to the show.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo was awarded the game for a year, the Japanese authorities had already spent 30 billion dollars on the project.
However, this amount is only a drop in the sea compared to the cost of building Olympics, stadiums, and generally to strengthen the country's infrastructure to cope with such conventions, prepare it, and keep the games themselves.
The Japanese organizers have said that the Japanese Olympic Games, which should have been in progress during those days, but have been postponed for a year because of the Korean virus, would cost 12.6 billion dollars.
A report by a public observer in Japan, which was published at the end of the last year, although it was almost almost impossible to do so.
It is likely that the cost of delaying the Games cannot be fully evaluated, but it has been estimated that it may cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost of the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could run between 15 and 30 billion dollars.
It is so high that all the tax revenues of the Icelandic government were only about half the Olympic Games, based on the lowest possible cost.
The Olympic Games are a result of the size that they often have become the subject of economists who try to review the benefits and benefits of the Games.
In the most support, many seem to have concluded that the effect of the Olympic Games is less positive for the economy of those who keep them.
There is a significant increase in the number of short-term jobs, but in the longer term, cities tend to live with debt-building and threatening low-intensity costs of small used works.
In the 2016 games, the film's large-scale debts are heavily paid to the Games, and has been in trouble with the maintenance of all the major sports facilities built for the game.
The film was released in London in 2012, but it has been found that only 10 percent of those who received the job in the Olympic Games in the city were previously unemployed.
This means that it was not a new job except for a small part.
In general, cities have not been particularly successful in keeping the Olympic Games because of the decenter costs of the actors built for the Games.
However, there is a significant increase in the number of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities following the games, which are highly uncertain about the games of the game in 2021.
It is also unclear whether it is possible to accept all the number of viewers who are usually attending the games.
The main issue, however, is the honor that the cities will have to be superior, but it is difficult to value money.
In spite of the tremendous cost, it can also be said that the joy that the games bring is not the kind that it can be placed on a price label.
But while the vision is often awesome and no savings, this, of course, is not just a matter of money.
It is the sports heroes who are in the foreground.
For some of the achievements, it is surprising that it is only welcome to postpone the games.
The Australian fifth-old winner and gold medalist in his article on the page Games of the Olympic Games, Chloe Eposito, is a kazopla and had been far from old age in the summer, but it is expected to have come to a contest for the game in 2021.
So it is among the athletes who are only quite happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who wanted to quit the game for a year, they would have been held at the right time, the delay in the game in some cases means that they would leave the contest before the games are taking place.
Trust his body simply not to pass through a year more severe exercises.
Few athletes were as sensitive in the hearts of the audience at the 2016 Summer Olympics and Simone Biles.
She brought four gold round about her neck and one bronze.
In the past, Biles has been interviewed in several interviews in the United States for the last time to discuss the Olympic Games.
She does not have a chance to play 2021, but she is not necessarily sure she will be able to stay at the top of the game in the following year, and that she will be 24 years old.
Although this is generally not considered to be high, it is higher for a female actress in the first row.
This is a sensitive issue, says Biles, but smiles in another interview published on the Instagram page of the Olympic Committee asked whether it will reach the same length at the 2021 games, and she did in Rio on 2016.
• I just don't know if I'm still going to be on the top for a year in addition to exercise, says Biles.
She has previously said that her body does not tolerate the stress that comes from high learning.
However, she prefers a career for the 2021 Olympic Games.
Biles admits that it was an unpleasant feeling that it was necessary to stop suddenly to elevate the outbreak of the highest and the filing room was closed.
There were no exceptions to Biles rather than others while all the sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold could not buy any access beyond the others, and she needed to find ways to stay in a form like others.
True, the basic form is much better than for most people.
• We have a rigid plan now.
It was hard to start training first after the gymnasium opened.
We started slowly, but we are completely crept, and I will increase the exercises as well as the year passes.
Of course, we do not know exactly how these games will be or whether they will be held, but we practiced viewing them, cannot help.
I have put too much effort to leave the sport now, and Biles recalls Biles.
Like others, she doubts, or perhaps more conscious that this situation may arise that the games will not be held at all in 2021.
But to predict that is hopeless.
No one can know how the situation in the epidemic of the coronation virus will be in July 2021, and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympic Games, viewing it will be held a year.
Perhaps the Olympic fire will be the light at the end of the Covidgang.
Allowances for the epidemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding because of the Korean virus.
She was married to former Bachelorette, now a runner Wells Adams runner.
• I think it is other important things to think about akkurat now, and the actress said to the actress in a conversation with People.
• We may have married some time and have the dream wedding and have all our loves that are dear to us.
But we decided to postpone and focus on what is important now, and it is helping to share information about the importance of being masked and stay at home.
I look more to the world than the wedding day.
There are many things in progress, and we should focus our attention on what is happening in the world.
