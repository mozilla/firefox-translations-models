And just, this is a story about how we know what we know.
It's a story about this woman, Natalia Rebkesinski.
It is a scientist in ancient fossils, which means that they are competent to exhume very old dead beings.
Natalia Rykxinsky: Yes, there are those who call me "doctor of dead things".
Qalif Nasser: I think it is particularly interesting due to the drilling spaces to search these things, towards the upper Arctic in distant Canadian tundry.
One day of the summer of 2006, she was at a drill site called "Galm Oriented", which is located below 10 degrees of latitude away from the pulling North Pole.
Natalya: Indeed, it will not seem, it will not seem, because you spend the entire day, a bunker bearing your back, the location system, and a book that captures anything that may seem to be excavated.
Latif Nasser: At somewhere, I noticed something.
Natalya: Thing of a rusion, rather than by the color of the rusty, how much my hand is how much.
She was lying on the surface.
Latif Nasser: I initially thought it was just a fragment of wood, because such things were found in that place before – vegetation parts of prehistoric eras.
But that night, on the way back to the camp.
Natalia: ... He directed the lens of hand, carefully checked her and realized that he did not carry traces of the trees.
Maybe one thing has been carefully preserved, but really similar...........
Bone.
Latif Nasser: Over the next four years, I went back to the site, eventually collecting 30 fragments from the same bones, most of them really small.
Natalia: Not a big group. She can afford her little Zeblok's sap.
Nasser Lattif: I tried to collect it together like the pole of the punctions.
But it was a challenge.
Natalia: Shmed to several small pieces of size, trying to use sand and paste, but doesn't look good.
Eventendly, we used a 3D light scanner.
I'm plish: Oh! Natalia: FYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Lat Taif Nasser: It turned out to be doing it presumably the easier way.
Natalia: It is a kind of magic when it is appropriate for each other.
To I'dn't know that you do it as properly, you'd to have you collected it correctly?
Is there a possibility of bringing them together in another way, for example, and getting Barretet?
Natalia: No. We're we got that.
Latif Nasser: What I get, it was discovered, the leg bone bone, and specifically, belonging to the mammalian species with a shade, something like a cow or a estrangement.
But it couldn't be one of them.
He was very big.
Natalia: The size of this was massive, huge, animal large animal.
To Zif Nasser: What Zoological can be?
She introduced one of the fragments to some of her colleagues in Colorado, and had an idea of her.
Natalia: As a sawman, we made a loophole, and he issued an interesting smell.
Latif Nasser: His smell resembles the encroammer.
Natalia was a smell known by Natalia by she's climbs at the anatomy laboratory: collagen.
Choling collagen is what gives the structure of our bones.
Ties, after many years, they collapse.
But in this case, the Arctic was like a natural refrigerator and preserved it.
But a year or two, Natalia was present at a conference in Bristol, and met with her colleague, Mikback, was an explanation for a new process called the "collagen shatter".
It was found that different classes have a slightly different collagen structures, if acquired the formula of collogenesis from unknown bones, you can compare with known varieties, and who knows you may get match.
So I sent him one of them, Fedix.
Natalya: Yeah, you want to follow that. It're really important.
. Latif Nasser: He treated her, comparing her with 37 known species in our age of mammal.
He received a match.
The 3.5 million-year-old bone found by Natalia of the upper Arctic region was found to be back.
Blood.
Not nalet: and you, what? What? Iss amaz - if true –.
Latif Nasser: They examined all the fragments, and obtained the same result.
However, based on the size of the bones discovered, this means that these totals 30 percent of the grief found in the modern era.
This total will be about 9 feet long, and weighing about half a ton of.
Yeah,
Natalia found a giant came from the Arctic.
Now, when the word “austers” is heard, one of these may be the sentences of two years from the Middle East and Central Asia.
But the chances of the picture painted in you are one of these, the only lumps, the fundamentalist hippocampus of the desert – in hot sandy spaces such as the Middle East and the desert, on the backsst of great ancient water storage of long Saharans, have two feet long and two ground feet to help them climb the dunes.
How does one of them finished here in the upper Arctic?
Well, scientists have long known, as it has been, even before Natalia discovered, that camels are in fact of American origin.
They first appeared here.
For nearly 40 out of 45 million beauty years that were present in parts, they can only be found in North America, about 20 different, and perhaps more.
Natalia: If you put it in a group, will it look different?
I'm nasture, you will have different sizes.
Some will have a very long neck, even in fact they look like a butterfly.
Latif Nasser: Some nose, such as crocodiles.
Natalia: Prittle, has already been small in size, almost like rabbits.
Ist-Nasser: What? Jamal with the size of rape?
Natalia: Ancient of her.
So they may not be able to identify them.
Latif Nasser: Illah, I want the faeler-giring animal.
Natalia: I know, are it won't be wonderful?
Latif Nasser: Since about three or seven million years ago, a group of beautys moved towards South America, where it became Lama and poncin, another crossed the Brangia Bridge to Asia and Africa.
Then the end of the last ice age, came as camel up in North America.
Scientists knew all that was already all, but it is still difficult to explain how one of Natalia found one in the north.
Low temperature, pole is the opposite of the desert.
Let� now be fair, three.5 million years ago, the average temperature was 22 degrees Celsius, he was heter than it is now.
It would have been northern forests, more like Yukon or Siberia today.
However, like, the winter will be six months where the owl freezes.
It may hit snows.
The night spanning 24 consecutive hours.
Like, how... How?
How can one of the stars of the desert survive and live in such polar conditions?
Natalia and her colleagues believed they had the answer.
It's something great.
Whether the advantages we imagine make sentences adapt to places like the desert, have in fact evolved to help him cope with the winter?
What if it was supposed to have not been the feet of the sand, but the snow, like shoots to ski?
If the hump – and it was surprising to me, didn't contain water, but contains – existing camels to help face the six months of winter. When is a scant?
Later, after a long time crossing the bridge, did it adjust the winters to cope with the hot desert environment?
For example, stamp may be of camel in hot climates because all fat is in one place, such as a lippo for fat, which means that does not require all this part in the rest of the body.
It helps smooth the heat dissipate.
This is a crazy idea, which seems to be evidence that the ideal character of the desert can be an ancient proof of the Arctic.
I'll have the right person to tell you this story.
Others said they are a way to learn from evolutionary biology or a future key to climate change.
But I love this for entirely different reasons.
For me, this story center around us, how to see the world and how it changes.
I received training as a rescindch.
In fact, many scholars are also historians.
They made the past logical.
You tell us the history of the universe and the planet we live in.
As a historian, with an idea in your mind about how the story ends.
Natalia: Created stories and commit to them, such as camels in the desert, isn't it?
This is a great story! She fits perfectly for it.
He obviously lived there forever.
Nasser: But at what moment, some evidence can be discovered.
Some small things can be learned to make you all else you think you know.
For example, in this case, one scientist found one piety of what she believed wood, and because of it became completely new theory and the appearance of this creator looked entirely on.
For me, this is completely heartened by the way he think about the sentences.
It has been transformed from a stowaways only suitable for a single specific environment, to be travellers in the world that happened to be in the desert, which can end almost anywhere.
I give you, "Azuri".
"Azure", welcome, how do you be?
Well, here, I got one of hers to you.
Azure enjoys a break from his normal disturbance in the music hall of Radio City.
It's not just a joke.
However, “Azuri” exists among us as a living reminder that the story of our world is vibrant.
It requires readiness to adjust, and habit is usually imagined.
Isn't it, "Laherie"?
We are just a small piece of seeing the world in a new way.
Thank you very much.
Today's computers are so staggering that we are failing to see how bad it is.
I would like to tell you today about this problem, and how we can fix it with the science of nerves.
I would first like to return to a cold night in the 2011 neighbourhood that had a profound impact on me.
I was sitting in a local bar outside the University of Colomipa. Computer science and neuroscience, I was with one of the students in an interesting conversation about the ability of the images to be one day to replace computers.
As we would go to the most asterious part of the talk, he was, of course, evicted.
He drazzed and looked at him and started printing.
He began by forcing his eyes to look at me, saying, "You complete my focus."
But of course, his eyes were tied to the utopach, and the moment died.
On the other side of the bar I noticed another student with his phone. This time he was with a group.
The images browsing on Instagram, and those children were solery.
This confusion is between my sense of esand and their happiness about the same technology. He made me thinking.
Whenever he didn't go, the harder the negative factor in the equation was not digital information, but simply the place of the screen that separated me and how they were collecting those boys.
As you see, they have been as societal around something, just like our ancestors who developed their social entrepreneurs tell stories about the camp.
This is exactly the role of the tools, I think.
Its role is to extend the capabilities of our bodies.
I think the computers today are doing the opposite.
Whether you send an email to your wife, you make musical musician or friendly, you're almost all of this.
You are bend downwards over those rangs, lists and more rectangles.
And the danger I'd think that's the wrong way, I think we can use a closer machine to nature.
We must use machines to bring our work back to reality.
We must use machines that use neuroscience principles to feed our senses than reduce them.
The conditions have you like to have such a machine with me.
Meat 2.
Let's show it.
I see the public directly before me, and I see my own.
In three, two, one, one, we will see a spectral image, a very realistic, picture that appears before me, before the me of the views of these who we are now wearing.
This can be anything to tampering for him or we learn from, and I can use my hands and move them easily.
I think the iron man will be proud.
We'll go back in moments.
Now, if you are like like, and your mind must be left out of the possibilities of what this technology will allow us to do, to look for some of them.
My mother is an architecture engineer, if it is normal that the first thing to imagine it was to extend construction in a three-dimensional space rather than using these two-dimensional schemes.
It's the fee at the moment and chooses a decorra internally.
All of this was shot across the Go Pro camera through our own glasses.
This second use has a privateity, it is a professor's glass brain representation project, thanks to the University of California in San Francisco.
As a pupil in neurology, I always dream of being able to learn and keep all this complex brain structure with a real machine, able to touch with various brains.
What you see as an enhanced reality is called enhanced reality, but for me, it is more complex - the story of how to extend our abilities by means of digital devices instead of playing the opposite.
Now....
I think that in the next few years humanity has continued through a transformation.
We will begin to develop a whole layer of digital information on the ground.
Imagize for what this might mean for the nonaise, to the painters, to the inner surgical surgical designers and perhaps all those present today.
And I think we need to do it as a society. It is trying and making an effort to imagine how to create this new reality in a way that provides human experience, rather than making our reality as a game or the wreckage of digital information.
That's my passionate.
I want to share with you a small line.
Five years later, -- this is not the smallest devices -- almost five years later, all will appear as blasphemy on our eyes showing spectral images.
Just as we don't care about any breath for what kind of equipment – we buy it because of the operational system -- as a nerve agent, have long dreamed to work a mind-player system.
And it's important to do it in the right way, because perhaps we lived within these things at least throughout our lives by the Wondows's graphical front.
And I don't know about you, but living within the Windows system frighter me.
To isolate months of infinity, we use neuroscience to guide our design principles rather than leaving a group of designers around them in the meeting room.
The principle to which we all aspire is called a "less resistive nervous path."
At every turn, the mentally employing system with our minds for the first time hugged the hulls of our brains.
In other words, we are trying to make an easy-to-use computer.
We are building a system that you have always done how to use it.
These are the first three design principles that we are using in this new user experiment.
The first and most important principle is that of running.
Traditional file systems are complex and abstract. Your brain requires a greater effort to decipher her.
It acts against the less resistant nervous path.
In the strengthened reality, of course, you can, of course, put the spectral image of your e-mail on this side of the office, and your locality has evolved in a way that allows them to be found.
You can lay the Tesla ponds you want to buy -- or whatever they asked my team to put me before the offer.
And great, your brain knows how to get it back.
The second principle we call it "touch for vision".
What do children do when they see something that they interest?
They try to get him to.
This is exactly how the natural machine must function.
It has been shown that the visual system gets a basic boost of a sense of deep tolerance – that it is a sense of inpatience of internal organs.
So, then, how far, touch on our work, we will not only be able to control it better, but also to understand it deeper.
The idea of “touching vision” has come.
But it's not enough to try things ourselves.
We are social communes.
What leads me to the third principle, the camp's stack of our first story.
Our own mirror nerve cell suggests that we can better communicate with each other and work if we can see and hands in some way the three-dimensional manner.
If you look at the video and my view, you're telling, you're waiting to be treated dead-mounted devices with the same spectral image, and connected about it, rather than distracting them with external devices.
Let's try this again with the brain of neurology consideration.
So, then, our preferred operating system, the mentally employing system.
I will now take a step forward and take this glasses and leave them here next to the Bureau.
I'm here lecture with you at the moment, we are in contact.
Dos my topical memolates and can take them and bring them towards my grammeah, reminding me that I am a cheat system.
The sense of a deep sense of learning I work, and I can blow up these glasses to millions of pieces and sunset that now swept a handworll.
But the vision of one-size-fits-all things is not enough, after my partner will make a three-dimensional call --?
How's the case?
I can see my front threefold.
He's very realistic.
Thank you.
This will replace the phones according to the cell of the mirror nerves in the not-far future.
How do they be?
We're very about live.
:: Gun-tooquired the spectral brain that we saw in the video earlier.
This will not only change the telemetry, but also the way we cooperate.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
: Well and capacity.
This is the message discovered at that bar in 2011. The future of computers does not exist in one of these screens.
It's here, within all of us.
If there is one idea that I want to ask you, it is that the natural machine is not a fiction of the future, but is here in 2016.
This is why all 100 people in Meta, including the management team, executives, designers and engineers – and before the TED2017 conference, we will throw our computer screens and replace them with a truly natural machine.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, I appreciate that.
Thank you all.
I've shared one thing. For little explanatory presentations on the strengthened reality over the past year, it has been made almost.
There is a record among the technology experts. Its subject matter is we really see something real on the screen?
There is a question of vision, by how we see technology a broader view than it can see over the glass.
What we saw was true?
: Certainly.
Not only that, we have taken additional precautions to film it across lenses with a olella asgopro in the various shots we have seen.
We want to emulate the real-life experience we see across glasses, without any trick.
(): Thank you for seeing us that. I appreciate that, thank very much.
I're from the most liberal, tolerant, advanced, advanced in the United States, Seattle, Washington.
She grew up in a great family of Seattle.
My mom was an artist, my father was a university professor. I am really grateful to them for my upbringing, because I have always felt full comfort in my lifetime planning as fit.
In fact, it took another path that my parents planned.
By reaching the age of 19, the university left -- its legacy, expelled, said, what you wanted.
He then took a path as a professional playing the French trumpet that was my dream.
She played theatrical music throughout America and Europe, and she roamed a few years with the great jazz guitarist Charlie Bird.
At the end of the 1920s, I insisted on a member of the Slavera Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
It's the greatest of her life.
And to learn Valddaye never complained.
I'll support me during my path.
Their dream wasn't.
And they used to tell their neighbors and friends, "O our son, in a break for a decade."
f. However, there was a difficult conversation about my lifestyle I would like to tell you.
On 27, I was home to Barcelona, and I visited my father on Christmas, I was picking nyde with my mother and alone with a cuisine.
It was quiet, very quiet.
There's some speeches.
I said, “Why My mom who is going to go in your mind?”
“I really and your father really worn about you.”
I did, “What?” I mean, what are it, now?
I replied: I want you to be quite frank with me: were you vote for the two republics?
And we're well, the truth is, I wasn't political, just a French-onthrealist.
But I was busy with discoveries, and they had revealed that, and the reason for that some confusion.
As you see you have been ardent to capitalism, I want to tell you that wasn't that.
That seems to be a constant concern that they have ratified it or not, in poverty.
You also see, when I was small, and raised in Seattle, I remember the first time, when I saw real poverty.
We were a family of an under-a-middle-class, but of course it is not really poor.
That's never close.
I first saw poverty, and poverty, when I was six or seven of my age, the early 1970s.
Like many of you, it was a non-regular example.
She was a photograph of the national journal's geographically of a child who was in Omari in East Africa, and there was a flim on his face and a philanket.
He was not spared from his inevitable, I was aware of that but I couldn't have done something.
Some remember that image, not exactly that image, but what a picture like it.
I presented the West with the sharp poverty around the world.
Well, that vision later, until she ranked, went to school out of school and returned her and begun to form my family.
What happened to that child?
or to people like him around the world?
The study began, although I wasn't if I were not in school, I was looking for the answer: What happened to the poorest people in the world?
Is their condition worse? Did you improve?
I found the answer, I changed my life, and I want to share this with you.
Most Americans believe that poverty has worsened since we were children, since they saw that vision.
If I asked you, “Are poverty around the world has worse or worse?” will respond 70% of people that hunger has worsened since early 1970.
But that's the truth.
This is the discovery that changed my mind.
From 1970 to 1970-present, the proportion of the world's population living in hunger levels, living on one day, is, of course, adjusted for inflation, which has fallen by 80 percent.
There has been a decline of 80%s to the worst poverty in the world since I was a child.
I didn't even know that.
That's my miracle.
This is something we have to celebrate.
It is the greatest achievement against poverty in the history of humanity, and has happened in our lives.
When I knew that, I wondered what would we have done? How had it been possible?
If you don't know why? You'll be able to do it again.
If you want to do it again and get 2 billion people out of poverty, that we have been talking about since I was a child, at least two billion of those brothers, and our sisters, who were driven out of poverty.
I want a billion more so I wanted to know why.
She started looking for answer.
It was not a political answer, because I didn't care.
I know, I still do not care.
I wanted the best answer by left economists, right and center.
We're we.
These are the reasons.
These are 5 out of two billion of our brothers and sisters from poverty since I was a child.
First: Globalization.
Second: Free trade.
Third: Property Rights.
Fourth: Rule of law.
Fifth: Creation of projects.
This was because of the world's pervasive free economy after 1970.
And now, I'm not naive.
Do�ch be seen that free institutions are not ideal, know that free institutions are not all we need to build a better world.
But that's great.
Impede from politics.
That's what I learned. That's what I discovered.
Capitalism is not just accumulating.
For their best, ambitious, as many people speak over this platform, which comes from dreams and is integral to the system of free economy.
We have to share it with more people.
Now, I want to share with you a second discovery linked to the first discovery and which I believe will contribute to development not only around the world, but here at home.
The best saying is to summarize the ideas I have just said about people emerging from poverty: “Free markets have created more wealth than any system of history.
Billions have been dragged out of poverty."
Who said that?
It looks like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
That's wrong.
President Barack Obama is the one who said.
Why do you know that about a heart?
Because he told me.
Hands.
I said: Halilwea.
But more than that, I said, "What you're from an opportunity"
Do you know what I thought about?
This was during an event we were doing on this topic at Georgetown University in May 2015.
I think, that is the solution to the big problem that America is facing today. What?
These ideas, liberals and conservatives, to help those who need us most.
Currently, I will not have to tell anyone in this room that we are in crisis, in America and many countries around the world are related to political polarization.
It has risen to critical crisis levels.
That's not easy, nor is it true.
There was an article in the past year on the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and is one of the most prestigious newspapers published in the West.
An article was published in 2014 on the asymmetries of political action.
This is what psychologists call the phenomenon that your faith is based on love but your opponent is based on hatred.
This is common in the global conflict.
This is expected to be seen between the Palestinian and the Israelis, for example.
What found in this article book was in America today, most Republicans and Democrats suffer inconsistent political action.
Today, the majority of people politically active in our country believe they are moving with love, while the other defended hatred.
Think about this. Think about this.
Most people say, “As you know, my doctrine is based on compassion, I want to help people, but others have pointed me and they are.
You cannot develop as a society when they suffer from this kind of asymmetry.
That's impossible.
How do we find a solution to that?
Well, first, let's be frank: there are differences.
Let's not say the differences. This will be a kind of naive.
There are many good research on this.
One of the old TTED lecturer is my friend Jonathan Height.
He is a doctor in psychology at New York University.
It conducts studies on the faith, values and ethics of several people to discover how they differ.
For example, conservatives and liberals have proved to be of different importance in what they think are important.
For example, John Heideet has established that liberals care 59 percent more than on economic freedom.
Conservatives care about 28 per cent more than their poverty.
Divercial differences does not it?
We will never agree. A wrong.
This is the diversity in which our power lies.
Recondler you will remember what hasn’t get out of poverty.
This obsession with poverty, linked to the increasingly globalized economic freedom.
We need each other, or in other words, if we want to help people and lift two billion more from poverty.
No other method exists.
I'd get.
How do we do it?
It'd be a thing, isn't it?
We need creative thinking.
Many of him is on this podium.
Create yes. Of course. Discelling.
We need to invest overseas in a sustainable, moral and responsible manner. Yeah.
But do you know what really we need?
We need a new day with a flexed ideology.
We should be less predictable.
Isn't it?
Do you feel your faith are beginning to become predictable?
Someone words?
Do you always feel listen to people who agree with you?
Why is this dangerous?
Because when we talk in this country about the economies, on the conservatives, you always talk about taxes, laws and big government.
On the left, liberals, you speak of economics, always centred on income inequality.
These things are important now, very important to me. And very important to you.
But when it comes to saving people who star starves and they need us, that’s what they want, they will distract from them.
We need both the Union and agree on the best of the ways to alleviate poverty by making the best means at our disposal, which can be achieved when the conservatives recognize their prey of poverty, and the Liberalians need conservatives and their fake free business.
This is diversity where the future strength lies for this country, if we choose it.
So how do we do it, how do we do it together?
He has acquired some working rules, not just to you, but also to me.
First. Remember, not good enough to tolerate those who disagree with you.
This is not good enough.
I must remember that we need different people with us, because there are people who need all of us still waiting for these means.
Now, what do you do? How will you do?
Where'd where to get out of this? It starts from here.
You know, we all know in this room now bonuses.
We're bowing with people who hear us.
We're blessings of well-being. We're bond by leadership.
When others, with this kind of unexpected ideology, can listen to people.
Perhaps progress can be made towards that point.
That's the number one. Numbered two.
Number two: I ask you and ask myself to be that person who goes beyond the barriers, the mysterious person, who is difficult to classify.
If you are a conservative person, he was the conservative person who always seeks poverty and moral duty to be an anti-poverty fighter.
If I was liberal, he was a liberal, who spoke always about the beauty of free markets to address our problems when they used responsibly.
If we do, we will have two things.
First, we should start working on the next two billion, and we have to find a solution that we have seen too much in the past and need to see more in the future. That's what it's going to.
Secondly, we may be able to change the terrible ideological war that we suffer in this country and turn it into competition in terms of solidarity and mutual respect.
And then, perhaps, maybe, may only, we mean that our greatest differences are not really so much difference.
Thank you.
When I was at college. My specialty in government work meant that I had many papers,
Now, when a dinner student writes a paper, his agenda looks like this.
As you're you.. Work at the start is slow, but you are done during the first week to make you see heavy days look like a gentleman.
And I hope I do this in the same format.
That's the plan.
I will write the table to start working, then come to write. And it ends that's how!
This happens in every paper I wrote.
I've asked to make the following 90 pages of graduation, a paper we are supposed to work on it throughout the year!
And to this paper such a paper, an usual schedule was not an option..
Because the project was too large.
Planning for the project began, and I decided that the table should resemble something like such..
That's how the year will go.
I will start with easy and light work, then make little more effort in mid-year, and at the end of the year I will work to the best of my effort. It will be very easy as the rise of the peace, the degree.
How hard is the climb of the degree is difficult?
Not big, right?
But I had something to sati.
In the first months,
It came and went on to say how quickly, and I couldn't do anything.
I decided to change my plan.
Then......... But in fact, mid-year went on to get fast, and I didn't write one word. Now is here!
The two months have shrunk for one month. And then for two weeks.
And one day she wok up, leaving only three days to deliver! And I haven't written words so far now, doing the only thing I can do, writing 90 pages percent in 72 hours, and have spent two days without sleep. Humans must not ensure two days without sleep, rushing to university, with slow movement handed over the exact date!
I thought I've done everything.
A week later, mystic contact, was a connection from the university.
W asked, "Are you'd Tim Orbern?"
Rebowed: "Yes."
“We must discuss with you about your thesis.”
I said: “Out of good.”
They said. "It's the best thesis we have in our lifes.”
This did not happen in fact.
It was bad thesis to far the limits.
I just wanted to enjoy the moment when you thought: "This man is staggering!
No, not, it was so bad.
And however, today I'm a writer and a blog in the Internet.
I write in a blog "Right, but why?"
Two years ago I decided to be a latent than the procrastin and postponing.
My actions have always breathed from overturning the unsuccessors, why my work has been postponed, I wanted to explain to them and the world, what's going on in the heads of those who are and postpone their work, and why we are so.
I had the theory that the minds of the prisoners were a different reality from the other people.
And to test this, I found a laboratory that allowed me to use a magnetic resonateer to film a graphic and clones of another man, so he postpone his work to compare them,
I brought the pictures with me to tell you today.
I now want you to take a closer look to notice if there is disagreement.
I know that not all of you are experts, and that it's not clear, but just look, good?
Here is a hype of a hybulist, which does not out,
And now.
Here is a cereal image.
There's a difference.
Both the minds contain but the mentality of the so-called also contains
Now, what does that mean to be my superior?
It means that everything is fine until that happens.
Man: "This is the perfect time to accomplish the work' monkey: "No!" If he will do something useful and a product. But the monkey doesn’t like it the plan, taking the wheel monkey and saying: Why don’t read the full Wikipedia page on the Nancy scandal and Tonya’s you just remember this happened!
Then.. We will then go to the refrigerator to see if anything changes in it for 10 minutes.
Next, we will enter the YouTube spiral that begins with the videos of Richard Weinman speaks of the magnet and ends after a very long period with interviews with Umm Justin Beper.
The monkey: "All this will take time, and there is no space for anything today.
"Le't!"
Now, what's going on here!
This monkey doesn't look like a leader behind the turbulence.
He lives altogether at the moment.
He has no memory for the past and nothing less well known about the future. He cares only about two things: "Facirrible and Fun".
In the animal world, this is done perfectly.
If you're a dog, and I’ve done only the easy and fun, you're successful by all measures!
For monkeys, humans are only another type of animal.
They eat, sleep and breed.. This will be normal in primitive times.
But, if not observed, we are not in those times.
We are in a developed and civilizational time and monkey doesn't know what that is meant.
That is why we are at our head, who gives us the capabilities that no other animal can do;
We can imagine the future.
We can see the full picture.
And we can make long-term plans.
All this decision is taken into account,
We want to do just what seems right and logical to do now.
Sometimes the act of something seems logical and fun at the same time, as being present or going to sleep, or enjoying a league.
That's why there is an overlap between logic and the fun.
Sometimes they agree,
In other times, it seems more logical to work hard and unbelonging for great benefit.
And here the conflict takes place.
For the matricious, this conflict always ends in the same way, making it spending most of its time in the Orange, a zone that is completely fluid and separate from the circle of logic.
I call it.
Now, a place you know you are well-sembly.
A place where leivation activities occur at a time of no real leisure time.
The fun that he has invisible is not real, because he is not worth the final and the atmosphere around you full of guilt, unfamous, unfamous, anxiety and hatred of all the feelings of beautiful prisoners.
When the monkey is behind the wheel is: how to pass the same well-off to the blue area, a region where less things are made is much easier.
Soel, it turned out that his work was postponed by a king of a guard, someone always watching him and viewed him into darkness and darkness. Someone called
Now is the lime of most of the times. But he is a sudden wake-upight, when any very deadline is close to being dangerous or there is a risk of embarking in front of people or loss of job, or any frightening consequence.
And most important is the only thing that fofed the monkey.
Now, this monster has become a life-shelled last time, because TED officials have reached me six months ago and invited me to talk to him.
And of I said: Yeah, my dream was always that
I am taking the TED Conference in the past.
In the midst of all this enthusiasm, the decision-makers were thinking something else.
He said, “Do we're clear about what we agreed to just now?
Are we know what happens in one day in the future?
We have to sit and process the speech.
The monkey said: I said, I agree with you in complete but think you think we will open maps of Google, and the picture is on the bottom of India and explore it for two-and-half hours until we reach India, in order to educate ourselves about this country.”
That is what we have done today.
It turned 6 months into 4, then then to and then one month. The TED Conference decided to make the Speakers's Declaration at the Conference,
When she opened the site, I found a face-check picture in my face.
And they've been gribbed?
He started losing his mind. In a few seconds, the system turned into mess.
The monkey – remembered, the monkey frightenness of pan monster - and rising in a date to the tree!
Finally, he was able to receive the rudder and started work on the lecture.
Now now all kinds of crazy behaviors are crazed at swirists, such as how I can spend two weeks of behavior in one word in mysis, and then – words come constantly in two days to write 8 pages!
This whole case with three personalities, this is the El Masuper system.
Not beautiful, but in the end, it works.
This was what I decided to write on the Code two years earlier.
And when you wrote, I was astonished to the responses,
Thousands of letters and prayers, of all kinds of people, from around the world, work all kinds of jobs.
They included nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and much of his doctoral students,
And they all say, saying the same thing: “I have the same problem.”
What's astonished me was the contrast between the abbreviated speech I wrote and the weight of these messages,
These people were very disappointed by what he did to procrastinate in their lives, what he did for them.
And when I thought it said, I said to myself: If the procrastiny system worked, what happened?
Why are these people badly frustrated?
It turned out to be two types of procrastin,
Everything I talked about today, all the examples, all of them have a deadline.
Where there are deadlines, the effect of the postponement is contained and compressed in the short term to interfere.
But there is another type of postponement, one that happens in circumstances that have no deadline.
For example, if you want to start a free business, something in art, or a pioneering work. These works have no deadlines at first, because nothing happened from the original. If you got and start working hard to get some activity to do the others.
There is also a lot of important work outside your scope and does not have deadlines. Like a visit to your own health, work to develop your relationships, or to sever your relationships.
Now, if the sole superior method of finishing these difficult things is through, there is a problem, there is a problem, in all the tasks that do not have the deadlines of the monster will not appear.
He has no time to wake up. So, the effect of the postponement will not be contained and therefore, these works will continue and extend for forever.
This is the long-term type of procrastination that is not seen and is not spoken of much about it like the first type: fun, short-range and final dates.
People typically suffer from type II with quiet and privacy.
This procrastination may be a great source of grief and long-term regrets.
I think: These people are seeing me, and that’s in such a bad case.
Not because they aim at a particular project,
Rather, because of that long delay, it made them like spectators, sometimes on their own lives.
Their frustration does not come from the lack of realization of their dreams, but because they could not seek them from the first.
While letters Etany read Atani a kind of inspiration: I don't think there is no outstrip his work,
This is true, I think you all are yourself, you'.
And of course, they may not be anarchist.. Like some of us. Some of you may have a good relationship with dates and commitment. But remember: Known Crystal theks when there is no deadline.
Now, I want to see something finally.
I call this:
Every square is a week in life of 90 years.
There do not seem to be many of them. In particular, we used many of them in the past.
I think we all need to take a deep look at this table.
We must think of what we really postpone, because each of us has something to postpone in his life.
We must remain careful not to have an immediate pleasure monkey.
This is a job for all of us.
Because there is not much of the box in the table, this is a job you have to start from today.
Ammusite, perhaps not "day" but..
As you know,
At the same time......
Thank you.
We were there, we were living and overcrowded bodies in the Texas church last night.
Sachones in such room, but with discrete, but with discrete, turtle-fed wooden seats with red, and Coral from behind me and a baptized wall modled.
Such a stone, but
With the same strong feeling of shinning, the same deep hope of salvation, the same race in the heart of the hands and the same people who do not hesitate in the back.
This was 31 December of 1999, the second night of the arrival of Christ, and the end of the world as I know it.
In that year she was 12 years old and she was not held accountable.
Once she stopped the complaint about how he was unfair, Christ would return again once he became responsible for everything he had done, she decided that I would be better to replace my own with the end of speed.
That is why I was going to church as much as I can.
She listened to the kin to the same lucticed lucticed to the nozzar one might listen to the noise, trying to make sure that the God did not tell me to me tell me and I decided to back early.
If he did so, I had prepared an alternative plan, reading the “Daybacknds” series, which was the last of the fashion at the time.
I found out of them that if I did not include the ecstasy at the middle of the night, I had another attempt.
All he did was to avoid the monster by taking me by his sign, fighting the demons, guilt, and the enemy of Christ himself.
That will be difficult – but I know I can do it.
Now the time for planning has come to an end.
It was 11:50 p.m.
We have 10 minutes, and we have called a piece of seats and even altar because he wanted to pray when midnight's prayer is coming.
This is why each faction took its place.
Coural stayed in his platform, the sun and their wives -- or the buffiles – or the buffiles, and I love you'h to invite them -- occupied the first place in front of the altar.
As you see, in America, I see, that the second came to a centre with a VIP department.
Behind the fully old bones were older adults -- these men and women whose young men and women burned down their young appearance under the incine dishot in the Texas, and their skin were stretched – because of burning – in the noble brown, just like the east of Texas, whose hopes and dreams were broken by what life might leave beyond even a successor.
Yes, for me these men and women were the stars of the show.
They waited their entire life for that moment, just as their ancestors of the Middle Ages came to the end of the world, and just as my grandmother waited on the eighth Andere on Channel every 4 p.m.
Its way to the altar has also stranded directly behind it, because I knew certainly that my grandmother would go to the facade.
I thought that if I hold on to her hand during this prayer, I might go with her in the right direction.
That is why I kept and closed my eyes to listen, to wait for me.
The voice of the pray became higher.
The appeal of prayer appeal continues to rise further.
Argan continued to add funeral hymn.
The freer came to add race.
I have adhered more firmly, so that I am not the person who left in the in the in the eye.
I was severely blind so that I did not see the wagee separated from the two.
Then the sounded on us: "Amen".
It's gone.
I looked back to the watch.
It was the time after midnight.
I looked at the older believers who were no loyal to them, who were very proud to seem to show any malend-out of disappointment, who were sorely believed and for so long to start in doubt now.
But I was up to them.
They were deceived, deceived, mislead them, and he was mixed with them all the time.
I've prayed them, moving away from every temptation as I can.
My head was wax not once, but twice in the baptism blessing that pushed the plant.
I've safe.
And what?
The house arrived in time to open television and watch Peter Jingings announce the beginning of the new millennium as it followed around the world.
I have been found to be merging anyway that it will be strange that Christ has returned time again and again according to different time zones.
That made me even more afraid, really tort.
That night, I didn't stop believing.
But I safed up with something new: it could not be thought of.
It is possible that the answers that had been wrong, that the same questions were wrong.
Now, old, as there was a mountain of certainty, there was a spring of doubting towards his base, a promising spring to the rivers.
I can trace all drama in my life since night in the church when my speech didn't come out; it became clear that it was something that I believed surely, if not a lie, it is not the truth.
Although most of you have prepared the new millennium in a very different way, I am sure you are here because some of you have done the same thing we have done since the beginning of this new century, having left my father and refused to come.
I banded my hand, looking for something I believe.
When the Yale University arrived at the age of 18, it remained confident that my trip from Oak Yeltzas was an opportunity to leave behind all the challenges it had known, the dreams of shattered, the defeated bodies that I saw.
But when I found myself in one of the winter holidays in my city qamed earth on a hand, and my own is constrained behind my back and a roose gun directed vertically, they understood that you can’t save me.
I had the withtress when I attended as an intern at Lehn Brothers in 2008.
I've heard of hope -- I even called the house to tell my family that we wouldn't get back poor.
But I saw the collapse of this temple of money in front of my eyes, they understood that even the best job it could not save me.
I had a long-held vote of “Ellans” calling for “Illenne, but in these elections there will be a change in America.”
But since Congress had stopped the state and the state had collapsed and changed as a harsh joke, it understood that even the second political camel could not save me.
I came wholeheartedly put in front of the altar of the American dream, and was chest.
But again and again, midnight, and I Fatah Isai to find that all those gods have died.
From that cemetery, the search began again, not because I was brave, but because I understood to either believe or die.
This is why I went into the pilgrid but elsewhere than Mecca, Harvard Business School, this time it realizes that I will not be able to accept the salvation allegedly presented.
No, I knew there'd more work.
Work began work from a dark spot at a crowded party, late in the early beginning of the dark winter of Cambridge when I asked me and three mock questions that young people were looking for something real for a long time: what had we go on a car trip?
We didn't know where to go or how to get there, but we knew we had to do that.
Because as Jacques Kirock wrote throughout our lives we have been “to sit at night and disappear,” and to tell what people all over the country are doing.
For this, although there are other voices, she said that the stakes were too great, and unnefixed success, we went any way.
In the summer of 2013, we cut up at 88,000 miles by America, between cow pastures in Montana, Detroit ruins, and New Orleins clie, where we found and worked with men who were young entrepreneurs where the bottom of the poem.
As we are trained in the Military Academy of Capitalism, we were surprised by that revolutionary idea.
This idea spread spread, becoming a non-profit organization called "MEA via America", made me standing here on this platform.
We have spread because we have found great tall as we find our generation in order to find a goal and meaning.
It has spread because we found an endless number of entrepreneurs in the dark corners and incursers of America who created jobs, changing life and need little help.
But to be honest, he spread because I fought to spread.
There have no limits at which he can stand for abrto with this Bible, and making more people believe that we can stir up the wounds of a shattering one social enterprise every time.
But it was that missionary trip that led me to the very different Gospel and that I came to share with you today.
It began the case almost a year of the Natural History Museum in New York, at the Harvard College business debate.
Under a full-fledged tactic version of the whale, sat with our time giants as they were celebrating their college and good work.
There was a sense of pride where capital and assets under management were over half a trillion dollars.
We have reviewed everything we have done, and it was good.
But, two days later, it happened that I had to travel north of Harlem, where I found myself sitting on an urban farm that was once a iddle land, listening to a man called "Tuni" who spoke to me about children who come there every day.
All live below the poverty line.
Many of them carry all their belongings in a bag that they have avoided losing home to the homeless.
Some came to Tony’s program, called "The Developing Larrome", to get their only meap.
Tony told me that he had started a "developing" of his retirement money, after serving as a taxi driver for 20 years.
He told me that he did not give himself a salary, because, despite his success, the program still had a lack of resources.
He told me that he might take any help he could get.
As such assistance, I was there.
But once she left Tony, she felt incineration and tear salt that fell from my eyes.
I felt the burden of inspiration because I could s in one room, with a few hundred people with half a trillion dollars, two days later, in another, 50 dunes, where no man paid to provide her only me me today.
It was not the glare inequality that made me ibek, the idea of hunger, and displaced children, not anger towards one percent or a companion to about 99.
No, I was confused because I finally realized that I was a crocopic laundry of a state that needed the process of planting a kidney.
I realized that my story of acting on all those waiting to solve their own problems even if they don't have what they help them are: the organization�� for all that has not reached all the structural and systemic aid that has previously arrived at Harlem, Apachea or 9th below; I'm right-listing about all those that seem illiterate, are not so poited.
The shame of this is as a shame that sat in front of the television, see Peter Jinnings announce the beginning of the new millennium again, and again.
I was deceptive, a misguided.
But this time, I was the pseudo-successful.
As you see, it has come a long way from that altar on the night I thought the world would end, from a world in which people spoke an ambiguous language and see suffering as a divine law and adopted that it was a fact that was inconceivable.
Yes, he improved much by having got back to the position from which she started.
It is simply not true that we live in the era of atheism – we don't believe today as ever.
Some of us may be thought of the bottle of "Brinje Brown" or "Tony Robbins"
We may be insured in New Yorkers as a book Bharvard Beisens Riview.
Let’s perhaps feel deeper faith when we worship here in the TED Church, but we want hard to believe, we need to believe.
We speak the language of influential, influential leaders that promise to solve all our problems.
We see suffering as a inevitable law of capitalism that is an inferior to us, we accept the text of technological progress as a non-majority fact.
Rarely rarely realize the human price we pay when we fail to question one step, because we fear that it will undermine that as a whole.
But if you are mokings because of the unreasonable things we have to accept, it must then be the time of accountability.
So I don't have the turboprop or renewals or "TBL".
Today I do not have the Bigs of faith to share it.
In fact, what I have and I offer is the leg of the doubt.
You do not ask doubt to stop believing, but asks you to make a new thing: it can be inconceivable.
It is possible that the answers we have wrong that the same questions can be wrong.
Yes, the Gospel of Questions means that on this stage, in this room, are wrong.
Because he raises the question of why?
And with all the power at hand, why are human beings still severely suffering?
This suspicion led me to participate, and we placed our organization "MBAs across America" outside of the work.
We have separated the staff of the staff, closed our doors and we will share our model free of charge with anyone who believes he can do this work without waiting for our consent.
This suspicion forced me to give up a feud of the role of some, because our time is too short and too far to wait for her to come back, when the truth is that it will be no wonders here.
This suspicion, it feeds and gives me, it saves me and gives me hope that when we are flooded with our problems, and they seem to lead us to your deceased, when our treatment does not offer our pain to our blind, faith will not be - our humble will be - it will be my humble to shed some light on the darkness of our lives and our world and allow us to raise our voice to insize.
Or, simply click or simply say, "threwe must be there's another way."
Thank you.
A food crisis.
A news that appears in the news every day.
But what is it?
Food in some regions of the world is or may be too many.
In other areas, genetically modified food saves the world.
The modified food may be the problem?
The proliferation of waste at sea creates poor oceanes and toxic oceans, and weakens nutrition.
And it's ever last.
In my view, the current climate of this debate is infalliblely unconstructed.
How can we get this to something we can understand?
How is this apple food crisis?
You all have taken on last week’s apple.
How many do you think of this apple from the moment it is to hit?
Two weeks?
Two months?
11 months of the average age of the apple in the favorite states opera in the states opinite.
And I don't expect the average to be very different in Europe or anywhere else in the world.
Stop them down, webb them in cold tanks and then fill the reservoir with gas. In fact, there are documented evidence of cases in which workers tried to enter these environments to review an amusement space, and died, from inside user of the apple process that causes human poisoning.
How have none of you taught this before?
Why didn't I know that before.
Ninety 90 percent of the quality of that apple -- all antioxidants -- are commuted at the time we get it.
It becomes a mere sugar ball.
How do we have little information of this degree and how can we get up?
I think we're missing.
I know programs -- I know computers, and I arrived on the Internet when I was small.
I've done very strange work – on this program.
But I meet people, and I can express myself.
How do you express in your own food?
If we have a feuds, we can ask: what if?
As for me, I asked: What if the climate is democratic?
This is a climate map of the world.
Most productive areas are green, less productive in red.
They exchange and change, and farmers from California now become Mexican farmers.
China takes land from the Braille to plant a better food, and we're abiding for climate.
What if each country had a productive climate?
What will this change in our way of life?
What will this change the quality of life and food?
The problem of the previous generation was, we needed more food and we needed to be cheap.
He's abody for your world's farm.
We have built a giant model for a farm.
All of these effects - are cartage, craters, trains and wheels.
It is a miracle that we feed 7 billion people even though few of us are involved in food production.
What to Lo..
We built a digital farm?
World Digital Farm.
What if you can take this apple, numbering them in some way, sends them through particles into the air, and regrouping them at the other end?
What if?
I'm go with a steak from these words, I'd inspire me to do what I do.
The first: "Japanese agriculture does not have young people, no water, no land, no future." This fell to the day I visited menamisariky in southern Fukuushima, after the disaster.
The children went toward Sanday and Tokyo. The land is contaminated, importing 70 percent of their food.
But this is not unique to Japan.
Two percent of America’s population is involved in agriculture.
What good answer can come from two percent of the population of any country?
When we veto wen around the world, 50 percent of Africa's under the age of 18
80 percent of you don't want to become farmers.
Agriculture is difficult.
The life of a small, disparidholder.
They go to the city.
In India: Farmers' families are unable to access basic services the number of warring farmers this year and the previous year more than 10.
It's not comforting to talk about this.
Where do they go?
To the city.
No young people, and everyone goes there.
How do we build this program that inspires young people?
He's ay for the new tractor.
That's a grouping.
In previous years, she went to Beath, Byund, Home Dibot and Elite began toher arrogant.
It built frivolous things and made plants dancing, pitpit insulation and killing them all – much.
In the end, he made them got.
It was built one of the most intuitive relations it had acquired in my life, because I was learning the language of the botanus.
I wanted to make her bigger.
They say, "That's, a boy!
This is an unwanted old electronic room.
What can you do?""
My team, and I have built a farm inside the media laboratory, is unknown across history of anything about biology, but everything from hypothetical life.
Within 60 square feet we produced enough food to feed 300 people once a month – not much of the food.
There is a lot of exciting technology there.
But the most striking thing?
Beautiful white roots, deep green colors and a monthly harvest.
Is this new cafeteria?
Is this new retail experience?
Is this new grocery store?
I can say one thing certain: this is the first time someone in the media laboratory has ousted anything.
We get power with bags; nothing is wrong with this.
But what happens when you have a processor based on images, a biter, bits and think, "Hosts are thought. Do you know something about -- I can accomplish this, want to be tried."
In this process we will get the plants and we will take some of them to the lab, because when they grow and raise them, they don't, they are kindly valuable to you.
I have this strange tongue, because I'd afradul to allow anyone to get anything before I eat it first, because I want it to be good.
So every day you can know the citavy the citager to one even the one.
I say, “No, 6.1 - no, no, cannot eat this day.”
The dear thing was so all the day.
It was too sweeping because the plant was sticky and created a chemical reaction in the plant to protect itself: "Let's death!"
And the plant that won't die, taste sweet for me.
Technology has retreated back in the psychology of plant organisms.
We thought that other people need to do this.
We want to see what people can make, imagine a lab we can shope anywhere.
And then we made it.
So in the medical laboratory interface comes my laboratory, which has 30 sensors per plant.
If you are know about genome or genetics, this is the phenomenon, the right thing?
The phenomenon.
When you say, “I like the strawter from Mexico,” actually loved straws from the climate that produced the phrase that you like.
So, if you hollow a climate -- that is, too, carbon dioxide, and oxygen creates a prescription -- which you program the ferry for this plant, the size of the plant, the size of the plant, its shape, its color, and its touch.
We need data. So we put a set of sensations there to show us what happens.
If you think you’ve been thinking of your vegets, looking at her and you’re so bad because you say, “Why do you die?
Farmers developed the most beautiful eyes to the tam when they became in the last 60 and 70 years of age.
You can tell you when you see the plant die due to a nitrogen deficiency, calcium deficiency or need more humidity.
These beautiful eyes are not transmitted to heirs.
These eyes are in the virtual absence of farms.
We extend these points of the statements over time.
Link these data points to single plants
These are procrollical in that day laboratories, via the Internet Protocol address.
We Bokley We have the title of the Internet Protocol.
If this is not an insomable, you can pressure one and get a personal file for the plant.
This teaches you the evolution of downloadable plants, but not as they think, is not only when he is ready.
When do you get getting getting the food that needs?
When does he achieve the taste I want?
Are you getting too much water?
Do you get a lot of sun?
Warnings.
He can speak with me, he's a speaker, we have a language.
I think this is the first user of Facebook plants, and it?
This plant information is given and this plant will begin with the addition of friends to God.
I mean that -- will add friends from other plants that use lower nitrogen or a more phosphorylation, lower potassium.
We'll learn about complications we still guess some of them now.
It may not agree to our friendship �re no, and may agree to demand our friendship, and this depends on our actions.
Well, this is my lab.
It is little better organized and my experience comes from the design of data centers in hospitals to everything, so I know little about creating the environment on which it is dominant.
Therefore, within this environment, we are testing for all kinds of things.
This process, water farming, was developed from Mir space to reduce the amount of water into space.
This process works on the basis of the full supply of the plant: water, minerals and oxygen.
The roots are not so complicated, so once they give them it, you got that like this surprising expression.
This suggests that the plant has two hearts.
Because it has two hearts, it grows four or five times faster.
It's a whole world.
We went far on the path of technology and a seed for a negative world and will continue to do so, but we will have a new instrument, which is also an integrated world.
Well we plant all kinds of things.
These tomatoes have not been commercialized 150 years ago.
Do you know we have stores for rare and old seeds?
Seed banks or banks.
I am assimilated.
She has live assets that you have never done all.
I'm the only one in this room that eats of this kind of tomato.
The problem is that it was as a paste amatoes that we don't know how to cook, so we eat the pasta tomatoes and wasn't so much.
We've done a lot in the use of protein. We wanted all the kinds of things.
We've lived even humans. We may be like you to do that, but we don't do it.
But what we have been confirmed is that, the tool was too large and too expensive.
I had begun distributing it around the world worth about $100.
To find someone carrying $100,000 in his back pocket is not easy, so we wanted another small job.
This project was actually one of my students – a mechanical engineer named Camille.
And we've done Kamel, I, and my team, you all traveled during the summer how we make it cheaper, and how to do it, how we can make it up for others.
Then we distributed it in schools between the seventh and eleventh grades.
If you really want to go, I try to teach a child something.
And so this is how I went to that school and said, "Times 65%."
One of the seventh class students, "What is the moisture?"
I said, "H, it's water that is in the air."
He said, "There’s no water is in the air, you't stupid.
I said, “Well, don't trust me.
In fact -- don't trust me, right?
Give him on 100.
What happened?
He started with condensing, a fog and then started dribards.
"Oh said. The moisture is rain.
Why didn't I simply say that?""
We have equipped to continue this very like the game.
They have an environment of three dimensions, they can get into it from anywhere in the world on their smartphones or their own small computer.
They have different parts of natural means, and sensitivities.
They choose the prescriptions created by other children anywhere in the world.
Choose and occupy the recipe and make it.
And as they grow they make changes?
They say, for example, "Why The Plan Need to CO2.
Isn't bad?”
If we increased gas.
If we cut it, the plant is growing well.
Toget the plant, have created a new numeric recipe.
It is an interactive design and development and process of exploration.
And then you can keep that, and all the data on the new plant they developed or the new digital recipe or what they did -- were it doing -- were it better or worse?
Imagine this as a small focus of operations.
We'll learn too much.
This is one of the computers of food, as we call it, in a school three weeks later.
These are three weeks of growth.
But more importantly, it is the first time that this boy has thought to become a farm -- or he will want to be farmers.
This opened all this for the year.
On the Internet, he counted to your first food computer.
That's going difficult -- that I told you.
We're at first, but everything there.
It's important for me to get easy.
We will continue to try to make him easier.
These are farmers, electromanganiser, mechanical engineer, environmental engineer, computer scientist, botanical, economic planner.
They work on a single basis what they are working.
But we're a little more.
This is the origins that have just begun.
It can be a warehouse anywhere.
That's his choice.
Within this warehouse we will build something such as this.
And they're now.
Looking it well.
They're actually there.
One of them is pouring vegetables, and another is raising an Aybla vaccine.
From a remarkable thing, these vegetters and the winner of the senior defense research agency are one of our reasons for advancing Ebola.
Plants produce a protectant protein for Aibola's disease.
Like pharmacists and food specialists, we have been down to the lethargy.
But these two things are nowhereflome, and here he has shown me with my field.
Everything is different.
We have reached the pestly of “everfall of good” and are like those who say “these black boxes -” and “Wan and you buy me.
"Ale, count, and the whole – I have very valuable intellectual property rights.
Buyers of my box, not his box,"
The truth is that we are at first, at a time when society is moving as well.
When we ask for cheap more food, we don't ask for better-friendly food.
When McDonald announces what is found in chickenballs, he stranged food in all times -- they establish their marketing plan on it -- everything changes.
Now we are entering the world.
Private food computers and catering centers are engaged on an open phenomenon.
They thought about an open genetic map, but we will develop small creatures, such as the Wikipedia, which can beheaded, occupied and developed.
What is this resemble in the world?
You remember that the world is associated with thread?
We started we find the beaacon.
We started sending food information, instead of sending food.
That's not from my imaginary, that is what we actually publish.
Food and catopered computers for food, and canomy data centers, connect people together to share information.
The future of food is not combat as the bad.
We know what is bad about this.
The future of food is about tipping the next billion of farmers and strengthening them with a rule to ask and answer the question, “Want?”
Thank you.
There are times when I really feel as European shy.
Last year, more than 1 million people reached Europe in need of help, and our response was frank, compliccerant.
There are many contrasts,
We are deeply saddened by the tragic death of the two-year-old Kurdish boy, and since then, the more than 200 children later in the Mediterranean.
We have international treaties that recognize that refugees are a shared responsibility, but we have accepted that the small Lebanon hosts more Syrians than a whole.
We regret the presence of smugglers for humans, but have made us the only viable route to seek asylum in Europe.
We have a shortage of employment, but we exclude those people whose economic and demographic needs meet come to Europe.
We are a faint with the liberal values we have in opposition to fanatical Islam, but we have repressive policies that hinder children, divide children and detain refugees' property.
What do we do?
How has the situation got this point by adopting this inhumane policy to confront this humanitarian crisis?
I don’t think it's because people don't care, or at least I don't want to believe it.
But I think that is because our politicians lack vision, a vision of how an international refugee system was built more than 50 years ago by the changing and globalized world.
So what I therefore want to do is a step backwards and ask two substantive questions, we all need to ask the questions,
The first question, why does the current system do not work?
Second, what can we do to reform this system?
The modern refugee system was created in the aftermath of the Second World War by these men.
Its primary objective is to ensure that when a state fails, or worse, by turning against its people, people find a place to go, to live in dignity so that they can return to their homeland.
It was precisely created for situations such as the one we see in Syria today.
Through an international convention signed by 147 Governments, the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, UNHCR, which specified that States must treat likewise on their territory fleeing conflict and persecution.
But today, this regime has failed.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In practice, however, our migration policies are on shouting the road to safety.
In theory, the probe has the right to be integrated into society, or to be returned to the country from which he came,
But their fate remains compassionate indefinitely.
In theory, the issue of refugees is a shared global responsibility.
In practice, however, geographic means that countries near postulated refugees take the world’s overwhelming majority of refugees.
This system has not been broken because its rules are wrong.
We have not been adequately applied in this changing world, and that is why we need to be reconsidered.
So I would therefore like to explain a little bit about how the current system works.
How does the refugee system work effectively?
But it is not above-bottom in the institutional perspective, rather than the point of view of refugees.
So Imagine the Syrian woman,
Let's call her a prince,
I princess for me represent many of the people I met in the region.
Amir, representing about 25 percent of the world’s refugees, a woman with children, who cannot return home because they come from the city you, Homs, a city, which was once beautifully and now infuriate.
And so a princedom cannot go there.
Nor does it have no hope of resettlement in a third country, as it is available only to less than 1 percent of the world’s shareholding.
Therefore, the Prince and family face an almost impossible option.
They have three basic options.
The first option is that a prince can take her family home to the camp,
And where you can get help, but there are very few expectations for a princess and family.
Camps are bleak, and arid, often in the desert.
In the Zaatari camp in Jordan, you can hear the sound of shells at night across the border in Syria.
There is restricted economic activity.
Education is often poor quality.
About 80 percent of the refugees living in camps must remain for at least five years.
It is a miserable life, and perhaps, this is, in fact, that only nine percent of Syrians have taken this option.
Instead, the Princess can go to urban areas, such as Amman or Beirut.
This option took it taken by about 75 percent of Syrian refugees.
But there is also great difficulty,
Refugees in these urban areas often do not have the right to work,
They usually cannot access help,
So when a princess and family used their basic savings, they are likely to face in urban poverty.
So there is a third alternative to them, which is why we have more refugees.
As a princess can seek some hope for her family risking their life on a dangerous journey to another, which we are witnessing in Europe today.
Around the world, we are faced mostly as refugees with no other choice between the three options: camping, urban poverty or a dangerous journey.
For refugees, this option is the global refugee system today.
But I think he's a wrong choice.
We can reconsider this choice.
The reason for the curtailment of these options is because we believe that those are the only options for refugees, and there are no other options.
Poles have frond the case as a result of which is zero, so that if we benefit from the refugees, we will impose costs on the citizens.
We tend to assume that refugees are an inevitable cost or burden on society.
But this is not necessarily and they can contribute to the whole.
What I would like to put forward is that we can expand those options so that everyone benefits: host countries and communities, our communities and the refugees themselves.
I would therefore like to suggest four ways in which we can change our thinking on the issue of refugees.
All of these four of these four methods have common Qasim: it is the same to deliver globalization, mobility and markets, and to update the way we think about the refugee issue.
The first first way I would like to think is the idea of enabling environments, which begin from the basic recognition that refugees are like human beings, but only in exceptional circumstances.
Together with my colleagues in Oxford, she launched a research project in Uganda on the economic life of refugees.
Uganda has chosen not because it is representative of all host countries.
Not it. It is even exceptional.
Unlike most of the host countries around the world, Uganda has done is to give economic opportunities to refugees.
They gave them the right to work and freedom of movement,
The consequences are extraordinary for both refugees and host communities.
In the capital, Kampala, we found that 21 percent of the refugees own businesses that employs other people, and 40 percent of these employees are citizens of the host country.
In other words, refugees create jobs for citizens in the host country.
Even in camps, we found exceptional examples of prosperous and vibrant pioneering companies.
For example, in a settlement called Nakaival, we found examples of Congolese refugees running digital music companies.
We found Rwandans running the businesses available to young computer games from recycled television and games,
Unlike the restrictions imposed on them elsewhere, refugees are innovating, and the man you see before you is a Congolese named Dimo-Kay.
Demo-Kay arrived at this settlement with very little, but he wanted to be a way out.
He started a local radio station, with a group of friends and colleagues, hired a video camera, now a filmmaker,
He provided two documentaries with our team, and managed to set up a very little business.
It is the kind of examples that should guide our response to refugees.
Instead of seeing refugees as they are bound to rely on humanitarian assistance, we need opportunities for them to seek human prosperity.
Yes, clothing, blankets, shelter, and food are all important in the emergency phase, but we must also look further.
We need to provide access to communication, electricity, education, and the right to work, access to capital and banking services.
All of the ways we take to reach the global economy can and must apply to refugees.
The second idea that I want to talk about is the economic regions.
Unfortunately, not all host countries in the world have done the same ways as you have,
Most host countries do not open their economies to refugees in the same way.
But there are still alternative realistic options that we can use.
Last April, I travelled to Jordan with my colleague, with my development economist Paul Collier, and I risked to us while we were with the international community and the government to offer employment opportunities through the Jordanian national development strategy.
The idea is an economic zone, through which we can strongly integrate refugees into work alongside the recruitment of Jordanian hosts.
Only 15 minutes after only 15 minutes of the Zatri camp, there is home to 83,000 refugees, the current economic zone called King Hussein bin Talal for Development.
The government spent more than 100 million dollars to deliver it to the electricity and road network, but it lacks two things: access to work and internal investment.
Why would refugees be able to work there. Instead of being striving with camps, they would be able to support their families and develop skills through vocational training before they returned to Syria?
We are aware that Jordan can take advantage of this, and which requires a qualitative shift and jump from a middle-to-state to a manufacturer.
It can benefit refugees, but it can also contribute to the reconstruction of Syria after the end of the conflict by recognizing that we need to embrace refugees as the best desfficit for the eventual reconstruction of Syria.
We published the idea in the Journal of Foreign Affairs.
King Abdullah taken this idea,
He announced in London at the Syria conference two weeks ago, and will begin to apply it next summer.
The third idea I want to place in your hands is a homogeneous preference between countries and refugees to reach happy results as you see here in the characters of Angela Merkel and Syrian refugees.
We rarely do is to ask refugees what they want, and to say, but what he is interested to do it and make everyone better off.
Econop Alein Roth developed the idea of homogeneous markets, in ways that the order of preference is a final homogeneity.
Fellows of Will Jones and Alex Telitum invented ways to apply that idea to refugees by asking refugees about their preferred places but also to categorize the types of refugees who wish to host them on language standards or to be allowed to engage.
Now now, and of course, of course, they needed to build quotas such as diversity and vulnerability, but the means to increase integration.
For example, students' involvement in kidney patients were successfully used, and behind algorithm-based algorithms were behind the algorithms.
Why aren't the idea of giving refugees big to be given more options?
It can also be used at the national level. One of the great challenges we face is to persuade local communities to accept refugees,
Currently, in my own country, for example, we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to cities, and this is far from meaning.
Market coherence therefore provides a potential means of achieving such preferences together and listening to the needs and demands of the hiring population itself.
The fourth idea I want to put in your hands is humanitarian visas.
Many of the tragedies and chaos that we saw in Europe could have been completely avoided.
It proceeds from the fundamental contradiction of asylum policy in Europe: in order to obtain asylum in Europe, you are going spontaneously through those fraught with those fraught with.
But why should such dangerous journeys be necessary as economic operators as economic operators and the capabilities of modern embassies?
It is never unnecessary flights, and last year, it led to the deaths of more than 3,000 people on Europe's borders and within European territory.
If refugees are simply allowed to travel directly and seek refuge in Europe, we will avoid this, one way to do so through something so called the humanitarian visa, which allows people to obtain a visit in a concert or a country where they simply pay for their journey through the jurors or to Europe.
About 1000 euros are the cost of smuggling part of Turkey into the Greek islands.
It costs 200 euros to travel economic flying from Bodrum to Frankfurt.
If we allow refugees to do this will be a big positive.
It will save lives, cut the road on the entire smuggling market and remove the chaos we see in the front line of Europe in areas such as the Greek islands.
It is politics that prevents doing so instead of rationally,
This idea has been applied,
Brazil relied on a pilot way as more than 2,000 Syrians were able to obtain humanitarian visas, and when they entered a description of a refugee.
Every Syrian with that project has refugee status and has been recognized as a real refugee.
Another historical precedent is.
Between 1922 and 1942, passports were used as travel documents to allow the transfer of 45,000 Armenians, Chechen Turks and travel through Europe and a refugee elsewhere in Europe.
The International Refugee Office was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for this workable strategy.
Therefore, all four ideas I have given to you are a way of expanding the scope of the princess' options,
They are ways in which we can get great options for refugees away from the three basic options I have explained to you even get better left.
In conclusion, we really need a new vision, seeing the expansion of refugee choices but that they shouldn't be a burden.
There is nothing inevitable about the cost of refugees.
Yes, it is a humanitarian and responsible issue, but they have humanities and talents, and they have the ability to contribute. If we let them it.
In the new world, migration is not on its way to disappear.
What we saw in Europe will be with us for many years.
People will continue to travel, and they will continue to be displaced from their homelands, so we need to find a realistic and rational way to manage this. It is not based on the old logic of humanitarian assistance, nor on the logic of charity, but is based on the building of opportunities offered by movement and globalized markets,
I assure you that we must wake up from our anonymity and urge politicians to wake up to this challenge.
Thank you very much.
When I was a little baby, I'd dream of the ocean.
That wild place, colorful and life, was home to those fictional alien beings.
The dominant large sharks of the food chain and saw the thorn steel turtles around coral reefs.
As a marine biologist who became a photographer, most of my career spent searching magical places like those I dreamed of when I was young.
As you see, I started to discover seamounts at a relatively young age.
But the first time she changed in the depths of the water, I was 10 years old.
I still remember very well when I was swimming to get that old cannon shaked to be hoard coral reefs.
When she finally came to reach him, I looked up waiting to fish from everywhere with all the colors of the rainbow.
It was the day it took place in love with the ocean.
Thomas Bishak is a photographer of a watographic photographer to keep this planet at 40, given the opportunity to discover some of the spectacular sea views of the magazine National Geographicc and a founder of our merce.
I have filmed everything of a huge shark to those who fit my hands.
The stereosmobies of humble grain of humpted hale species, which was floated with the cold seal in Canada, was swollen the rainforest of the great bear.”
I was familiar with the ritual of marrow of the sea green turtles in the Strait of Mozambique.
Everyone on this planet is affected by the ocean and affects it.
The ancient and clean seas that dreamed of them as a child are very difficult to find.
The sea has become more and threatening pressure.
As human beings, we are still preserved by the corpion crept on the ground, having seen and depicted many of these direct effects.
For a long time, I thought to disprotified the Republics of their disassociation through some disturbing images.
Although this approach has advantages, I'd first come back.
I believe that the best way to change is to sell love.
I believe that I am thinking I play the role of a “communication” and as a photographer, I have a rare opportunity to detect entire animals and ecosystems that lie under the ocean.
You can't fall in love of something and become a hero if you don't know that he's there.
Disclicted this . The power of photography for the cafe.
I have visited hundreds of sea sites, but only a few sea scenes have attracted me and have had a profound effect.
The first time it tested that altitude was about 10 years ago, off the southern rugged and wild coasts of South Africa.
In June and July, huge swarms from the sardines to the north were travelling in mass exoduses of what we called “sardine flight.”
Those fish have good cause of escape.
They are hunted by predators and aborigar.
Flolin cocked the Dolphin in a joint manner and could disperse a squad of sardines to create small and tempted groups of fish.
It pulls the fish to the ocean surface and then wears the dinner to the dinner of the celebration.
He is believed to be the shark behind this.
Now, most people believe that both shark and dloadine are fatal enemies, but during the “sardine break,” they actually coexist.
In fact, dolphins are helping sharks to feed effectively.
Without the help of dolphins, dining balls are more widespread and sharks end up eating the so-called sardless click, or a waterful mouth.
Currently, after facing dramatic moments with sharks during the "Sardine escape" it knew it didn't like a prey.
However, Illustine as any other guest during this very loud valley.
From the coast of Africa, the West Flain is to travel to the East, where the vast Indian Ocean to the Maldives, is an archipelago of atolls.
During the stormy southwest of the stormy, the sea demons are traveling through the archipelago to a small spot in Atul Talobe called Hairobi.
Large groups of crustaceans, most of which doll of eyebrow spectre, are the primary lure of sea demons.
When the amount of the vegetation becomes little, sea demons feed alone and falsify many times around themselves, such as a small pile chatter.
Where, when the amount of alveolery plants rises, the sea demons are rife to be a long food chain if the first fish can eat, by course it will be acquired by the pro-stitial fish.
The lower the amounts of algae in the bay, the closer the sea devils and the unique behavior of its kind called cyclone feeding.
As it is tightly hovering, this group of sea demons creates a type of hurricane, absorbing algae and providing them to its mouths.
The diving experiment in the hundreds of sea demons is indeed unique and unforgettable experience.
When Hanafaro first photographed, this area was not protected and threatened by development.
Working with non-governmental organizations such as Manta Trust, my picture has inevitably helped to become a protected area of Hanfaro.
Currently, fishermen from neighboring islands, once thicked sea demons to make traditional drums of skin these fish.
Today, it is one of the most exciting conservatives and earns the Maldivian economy due to sea demonsms of over $8 million each year.
They have always looked back time in an era when maps were mostly empty or read, "There is a dragon"
Today, his nearest place is remote islands in the western Indian Ocean.
Far away from sea ayron lanes and fishing fleets, diving into these waters is a memory of the feelings what our oceans once were.
A few people have heard of Pasas da India, a small spot of a coral in Mozambique.
It is a coral reef representing a protective external barrier and inner lake is the nursery for Galapagos shark.
That sharks were shy until today.
I had a sense that they would be more bold and rising at night.
I've never faced many sharks on coral shackles.
Images of such moments and their engagement with everyone -- I remember what I chose this path.
At some point this year, I was on a mission to National Geographic in the state of Baja California.
On some mid-down to the Pacific side of the Pacific Ocean, San Ignacio Lagogon, a place of grey whale.
For 100 years, the coast has witnessed a massacre, with more than 20,000 grey whales being killed, leaving only a few hundred survivors.
Today today the descends of the same whale that got that leads their young children to the roof to play and even to interact with us.
These species have really seen a significant return.
Now, on the other side of the peninsula, Capo Plume, is a quiet hunting island.
Decades of indiscriminate fishing have collapsed.
In 1995, local fishermen persuaded the authorities to declare their waters as a naval protector.
But what happened after that was no less than a miracle.
In 2005, after only one decade of protection, scientists measured the extent of fish recovery.
But you're not hearing the word from me, let me.
Only one of the same, drows me deep, one of the places is the most places for the fish it has encountered any time.
We all have the ability to create a kind of hope.
Through my photograph, I want to spread a message: it is not too late to protect our oceans.
I want to focus especially on the resilience of nature by facing 7.3 billion people.
I hope that I will look more and more to do such images, creating images that show our respectful coexistence with the ocean.
I hope you will become an event on a daily basis for me.
For prosperity and survival in my career, you really have to be a hopeful optimist.
To always serve the premissibility that the magnificent image that will change only very close, behind the next, within the next lake or perhaps in the next lake.
When she moved to live in Harare in 1985, social justice was the basis of Zimbabwe's national health policy.
The new government was emitted after a long war of independence and immediately declared a socialist programme: both health care and primary education were essentially free.
There has been a significant spread of rural health centres where nearly 80% of the population has access to those services in less than two hours on foot, a huge achievement.
In 1980, the Independence Year, about 25% of children were vaccinated in Zimbabwe.
By 1990, after just a decade, this ratio was 80%.
It was very proud to be part of this transformation, this revolution.
That sense of extermination and friendship was evident.
Working alongside Zimbabwean smart scientists, doctors, and activists -- I felt a feminism not only to the African independence movement, but also to the public health movement in progress.
But there have been enormous challenges.
Zimbabwe announced the first case of AIDS in 1985, the year it was introduced.
I cared for a number of people living with AIDS in early 1980s, when you trained at Harlem Hospital, but we have no idea what is in Africa.
The infection rate rose to about 2% in the early days when I was there.
This could rise for one of four adults 17 years after leaving Harare.
By mid-1990, I learned about hundreds of people in a very small year who had been infected with HIV.
I saw many colleagues and friends dying, students and hospital patients dying, dying.
As a response to these cases, I founded a hospital with my colleagues.
Many interventions have been to explain the use of condoms.
We have conducted interventions in places of education and work.
We've done research. We have provided guidance to injured men's partners on how to protect themselves.
We worked hard at the time I thought I was doing my best.
I was given an excellent treatment, such as what it was.
But I wasn't talking about structural change.
Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan spoke of his personal failure that led to the genocide in Rwanda.
In 1994, he was the head of the United Nations Peacekeeping Department.
In the commemoration of 10 years of genocide, he said: “I thought I did my best, but I realized after the genocide that there were many things that could or should have done to take the alarm of the alarm and concerted efforts to provide support."
The AIDS epidemic has imbued the health of the unprepared society, and today the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that it has killed nearly 39 million people due to this disease, not the only one that is saddlessly overly unfroyated with things playing more things earlier.
But while I was living in Zimbabwe, I did not see myself as a proponent or politician.
I was there to improve my technical, and my research skills on epidemiology.
In my mind, my career lies in patient care and research to better understand patterns of transmission among the population, and I have hoped to slow the virus.
I was aware that the socially marginalized segments of the population were at the most risk of contracting AIDS and death.
For sugar cane plantations, which are more like a feudal system than any modern institution, 60% of pregnant women have been infected with HIV.
She has worked to make it clear that the injury is not related to moral decay, but to the culture of male superiority, the employment of migrants forced into that and colonization.
As health professionals, we have been very limited: we have called people to change their individual behaviors, condom use and reduce the number of partners.
Infectivity rates have risen, and when treatment is available in the west, treatment, which remains our strongest weapon against HIV virus, treatment was not available to the public sector in Africa.
I did not mention the lack of equal access to these life-saving medicines or the implicit economic and political systems that caused infection rates in many inhabitants.
By reminding me of myself, I wanted myself to be a guest in this country. To have to say the alarm can cause my package, prevent me from doing good work, caring for patients, and carrying out the research I most need.
So I did not talk about the Government's early position on AIDS.
I didn't say my concerns were expressed with a sufficiently high voice.
Some doctors and health professionals will believe that I did nothing wrong.
We agreed with mypatology, the Subtaker and its derivers, centred about the sanctity of the relationship between the doctor and the patient.
I have done everything I can for every patient.
But I knew, however, that epidemics were emerging throughout the fragments of our society, which reflect not only biology, but more importantly, patterns of marginalization, race, gender, social and other discrimination.
This is true for AIDS.
This was recently true in the case of Ebola.
Medical anthropologists such as Paul Farmer, whose studies on AIDS in Haiti have been described by this structural violence: structurally, because abuses are inherent in economic and political regulation in our social world, often invisible ways for those with privileges and power, and that violence – a reflection – is a type of violence.
We do little things of disease if we fail to regulate these cases of social inequality.
The alarm berthing is the first stage to spread the right to public health, and is how to combine support efforts to break this condition and achieve some sort of change.
So these days, I will no longer remain calm.
I'll talk about many things, even if listeners don't comfort, even if I, I, no longer.
Many of my words will be related to racial and racial differences in institutions, things that are supposed to never exist in this country, which is not supposed to exist in the field of medicine or public health.
But they exist, and we pay them to finish our lives prematurely.
For this reason, the gravell on the impact of racism on health in the United States of America, the ongoing interpersonal and intra-peer and black-wirmind people, should be grapped by our tragic heritage 250 years from the introduction of Crown and 60 years of egalitarian equality, blocking the danger for this fundamental and central to the proper functioning of the New York City.
In New York City, premature death -- the death before age 65 -- is 50% higher for blacks than white people.
A woman with black skin in 2012 he faced the risk of death being more than 10 times a birth compared to a white woman.
Although we have taken tremendous steps to reduce infant mortality, black people are almost two times more risk of death than white infants.
New York City is no exception.
These statistics are being matched by other statistics across the United States.
A recent analysis in the New York Times proved that 1.5 million people of black people are missing.
They had pointed out that more than one in six out of six men were black men, who were supposed to be between the ages of 25 and 45 had been lost from daily life, and had entered or died before being completed.
This is a great deal of inequality in everyday and inappropriate violence faced by black men, and the recent protests revolved around the slogan of the ?e.
But we must remember that permanent and varying ratios and the mixed medical conditions – heart, cancer, diabesiatic disease, and AIDS – can lead to death very slowly and many people with long-lived black people.
As the life movement – the bad. She has spread, I felt frustrated and anger because the medical community had opposed the use of the word "racism" in our research and studies.
You'd feel something thing as I speak the floor.
Our medical students protested the Dy-Enz method in their white dolls, but the medical community supported it negatively since the discrimination still affected the level of diseases and deaths.
I am concerned about the trend about micromedicology and personality, looking for biological or genetic objectives to develop better treatments, which may inadvertently cause us to avoid the overall picture of the subject, which is where the person lives, whoever works, loves, love, and most importantly, the health of the population, and for many of us, “poor health”.
As health specialists, in our daily work, both in hospital and when research, we are witnessing a large inequality: a person who is homeless to be able to follow medical advice because he has other priorities, young people who think suicide is being drastically cruel because our society has been so harsh, the single mother who must feel responsible for her son’s ill health.
Our role as health professionals is not only to treat our patients but also to steer the danger and call for change.
Whether credible or not, our community location gives our voices great credibility, and should not be lost.
I am feeling not to speak in Zimbabwe, and have made a pledge that I am as a health commissioner in New York City, I will use every opportunity to steer the danger and join forces to support health equity.
I will speak against racism and hope you join me, and I will investigate you when you speak of discrimination on the basis of sex or any other form of equality.
It is time for us to promote and speak out loudly about structural inequality.
We must not have all the answers to let change.
We just need courage.
The health of our patients, and all of us are true to it.
Well, by showing hands enough of you have removed someone's friendship on Facebook because he said something turp on politics or religion, child protection or food?
How many of you are trying to ignore at least one person because you simply don't want to talk to them.
As you know, we just had to follow Henry Higgins's advice in My Feri Lady: to hold on talking about weather and health.
But these days, with climate change and vaccine fighting, those topics -- are not safe either.
So this world in which we live, this world, where every conversation has the ability to turn into controversy, as politicians cannot speak to each other and where I even fond the issues from being killed against them emotionally, it is not normal.
PUB Research research has studied 10,000 adults, and found that at this moment, we are more polarized, more divided, than ever before in history.
It is unlikely that we have a compromise solution, which means that we do not listen to each other.
We make decisions about where we live, and who, and from those who will marry, will be our friends, depend on what we believe in advance.
Again, this means that we're not listening to each other.
The conversation requires the nuance between speech and listening, and somewhere along a road, this conversation we lose this balance.
Now, part of that comes back to technology.
Smart phones that either are in your or your power or nearby enough to be quickly reached.
According to Bio Restrech, about a third of Americans send more than 100 messages on the day.
Almost many of them, almost all, are more vulnerable to exchanging messages with their friends than face-to-face.
There is an excellent article in the Journal of Atlantic.
She has already written a secondary school teacher named Paul Barnwell.
He gave his children a communication project.
He would like to know how to talk about a particular topic without using observations.
"I realized.... "
I realized that being able to conversate may be one of the most expensive skills we have failed to teach.
Children spend hours every day engaging with ideas and each other through screens, but rarely have a chance to refine personal communication skills.
This question may seem funny, but we have to ask ourselves: is there any skill in the 21st century more important than being able to maintain a coherent and confident conversation?”
Now, I am talking directly to people: Nobel lauresters, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state and plumbians.
I'm talking to people love them. I talk to people who don't love them,
I talk to some people who deeply disagree with them at the personal level.
But I still have a great conversation with them.
So I would like to devote the next 10 minutes to teach you how you talk and how to listen.
Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this, things like looking at the eye of the person during the speech, thinking in the course of interesting topics, looking at the head and smism to show that you are talking to you, repeat what I have heard to or summarize.
I want you to forget all that.
Because it's folly!
There is no reason to learn how to show you to get to pay attention if you’re really a rating.
Now, I actually used the same skills in my professional interviews in normal life.
So, I will teach you how to meet people, and in reality you will help you learn how to bettercome.
He knows to have your conversation without going missing your time and without compromising, God, without harming anyone.
We all made important previous talks.
We're we took them before, and we know how to look like it.
The type of conversation to which he is discharged and feels inspiration, or that you have learned deeply or have been understood excellently.
There is no reason why you have not had most of your relationships as their predecessors.
So I have 10 basic rules that I will explain to you, but honestly, if you choose and applied, you will have a remarkable conversation.
Number 1: Do not perform multiple functions.
I don’t mean to leave your mobile phone, tablet, your car keys or anything else in your hands.
But what I mean, he's the present.
He's the moment.
I do not think of the debate that has had between you and your president.
You do not think of what you will address on dinner.
If you want to get out of the conversation, I’ll get out of conversation, but not half within the conversation and half of the outside it!
Tanya: Doesn't cling to your opinion.
If you would like to put your opinion without giving any opportunity to respond, discuss, or increase and develop, your idea wrote a blog.
Now, there is really good reason why critics don’t allow me to exist my program: because they really are.
If they were conservative, they would be willing to warn Obama and food stamps and abortions.
If they were liberal, they would hate big banks, oil companies and Dick Cheney.
We can predict it perfectly.
You don't want to be.
You need to have every conversation on the assumption that you have something you want to know.
As the famous treater physician Scott Pic also said, the correct self-restation requires proper self-restations.
This sometimes means that your personal opinion is abolished.
We felt that acceptance, the speaker would be less likely to open up with his greetings and within his mind to the listener.
Again, let’s think you want to know something.
As Bill Nay said, “Anyone will be corresponding to him know something you don't know you can. "
I'm so word: everyone is an expert something.
Third: Use open questions.
In this case, the reference is the press.
Starting your questions with what, when, where, why or how.
If you ask a complicated question, you will get an easy answer.
If I asked you, “Dis you were terrified?”
It will respond to the strongest word in the sentence, which is "star," and the answer will be "Yes," or "I don't."
"Dout I was angry?" "Yes, I was so angry."
Let them describe it's who knows.
Do you tried to ask them such as "how it were it"?
"How'''' happened?
And then they may have to think about a moment, and so they will get more funable answers.
Fourth: Be walk with the current.
This means that ideas will come to your mind and what you need to make these ideas out of your brain.
I have often heard interviews in which guests speak for several minutes and then come back and ask a question that he or she looks like not to have left or answered in advance.
This meant that the host had stopped listening for two minutes because he thought this question, and he was determined to say so.
We're doing the same.
As we sat with someone we are talking, and suddenly remembering that day when we met Hog-Jackenment at the cafe.
We stop listening.
Stoices and ideas will notify you,
You need to let these ideas go and come.
Fifth: If you don't know, say you don't know.
People on Radioo, especially on stations such as NPR, are much more aware of being registering, so they find more cautious about the things they call experts and those they call sure.
I do so with caution.
Talking must not be cheap.
Sixth, you don't compare your experience with their experiences.
If they talk about the loss of a family member, you don't talk about when you lost some of your family,
If they talk about some of the problems they face in work, you don’t talk about how much they hate you for your work.
The subject is not, and will not be, it will not.
Every experiment can be taken to the point of view.
More importantly, it's not about you.
You do not need to speak and try to show how many someone is staggering or how much I previously suffered.
One person asked Stephen Hawking once about his echelon, saying, “I have no idea. Because the people who boast about their rate of intelligent are the failings.”
Talks are not a promotion opportunity.
Seventh: Doesn't try to repeat yourself.
Because this is a kind of self-circidation and boredom, and we do it so much.
Especially especially in working talks or in talks with our children, we want to deliver a certain meaning, so we just repeatedly talk.
They don't do it.
Eighth: He gets away from herbs.
What I really mean, people don’t care about the years and names, the dates, all of these details and those to remember.
They don't care that and what they care about it, you are.
You care about what you like, and what things you have.
So, forget these details and leave them.
Ninth: This is not the last point but the most important point.
I listened.
I may not be able to tell you how many people they said you could be the most important skill they can develop.
Buddha, and I'm here I'm listening to you, if your open is, you won't learn.”
Calvin Couled, "One is the loss of his job due to his excessive hearing."
Why don't we hear some of us a shoot?
First, we prefer to speak.
When I'm talking under control.
You don't need to hear nothing interested in him.
And so I'm at the center of attention.
I can promote my own identity.
But there's another reason: that our attention is dispersion.
The person at averages speaks about 225 words per minute, but we can hear 500 words per minute.
So why our minds are busy and full of 275 words like those.
I also know that it requires energy and effort to pay attention to someone, and if you can't do it, you don't really talk.
You are two people who scream and barely speak of some sentences in the same place.
Let us make us listen to each other.
Stephen Kofi said it in a beautiful.
He said, “Mounn're don't listen to the intent to understand.
But he listens only to answer.”
Another rule is the 10th rule that is abbreviated.
[Good conversation such as short engrowing. It is short enough to bring consideration, and long enough to stray – my sister [thell it's all's basic concept: I’m caring for others.
As you know, he grew up with a very famous grandfather, and there were certain rituals in my house.
And it was people to come to talk to my grand and serious, and after going, my mody comes to us, tells us, and tell, "Do you know who was that?"
She was the prescription of Miss America.
He was the mayor of Scramento.
I won the Polyters Award. It is a famous Russian diaspid dance.”
So he raised the assumption that everyone has something hidden distinctive about them.
Frank, I think that this made me the best host.
He's that I am as much as possible trying to keep my imatool, my mind open, and I'd always ready to be astonishment, and never with disappointment.
You have to do the same.
They got talked to people, listen to them, and, more importantly, were ready to be surprised.
Thank you.
Heat.
I'm the name Matthew Williams. I'm a hero.
He sight with medals in three different sports and in the national games in Canada, she played international in basketball and proud to have represented Canada globally.
I train five days a week on basketball and rapid skiing, working with higher-level trainers and mentally scholars who are best in my sport.
All of this is during the special Olympics.
Does that change your idea about my work about me and my achievements?
The world isn't like me.
Not long ago, like my likes were ostrators and hiding out of sight.
Much of the changes have occurred since the start of the Special Olympics in 1968, but in many cases, people are considered to be invisible to others everywhere.
People use humiliating words for front front, and they think that doesn't matter.
The word "delayed" or "late" is used in a humiliating manner.
They do not care how painful and painful my credibility is.
I do you just want you to believe that my presence here is because I represent a humanitarian issue.
I here is because there is still a big problem with the way people with intellectual disabilities, or, more often, how they do not care at all.
Do you know that he did he have organized the world Games this year?
I was one of the more than 6,500 psychologists from 165 countries who competed in Los Angeles.
There were more than 62,000 spectrotors to the opening ceremony, and there was live coverage by TSNFN.
Do you know what happened?
What do you think of someone like me?
I am here today to see us in an equal way.
Special Olympics spoke a change in the subjectivity of athletes with intellectual disability and in the visions of followers.
For those who are not familiar with the matter, the Special Olympics are aimed at athletes with intellectual disabilities.
The special Olympics are considered to be separate from the Olympiad and the Olympic Games.
We offer high-quality mentally handwave programmes for persons with intellectual disabilities can make changes to their lives and ideas.
This activity changed my life and that of many.
It changed the way the world views those with intellectual disabilities.
She was born with epilepsy and mental disability.
With old age, Hookahlok played to the age of 12.
The old the more you, the more difficult it is to get to everyone, and I was angry and frustrated.
I didn't practice any sport for a period of time, and I felt that I had not been abandoned and I had grief.
There was a time when those with mental disabilities were hiding away from the eyes of the community.
He didn't think that he could participate in sports, let alone be a valuable member of the community.
In 1960, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at Toronto University, was studying the effects of the practice of regularly studying the fitness of children with intellectual disabilities.
Through careful scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers have come to the conclusion that lack of opportunity to participate in the suffering of fitness.
Much of much doubted how physically skilled and sportsophories benefited from physical fitness and opportunity for sports competitions.
But the pioneers such as Dr. Hayed Heydne and Mr. Younis Kennedy Shrive, the founder of the Special Olympics, and proved the special Olympic players to be more than four and a half times.
Before I had a special Olympics, I was tentum, because I was young, whistle and unsuckt than me and no many friends.
When you arrived there, everyone was encouraged, working to support you and left the door to be in nature without prejudging judgements.
I am now now a basketball player and skier who has fought several competitions at the regional and national levels, and this year was able to attend the Summer World Games in Los Angeles, where I was the first to join the basketball team and compete at the global game level.
I have one of more than four and five hundred athletes from around the world, and I have heard many similar stories.
Being athletes at the Special Olympics have to retrieve our own ghettos and dignity.
Special Olympics treat critical health needs.
Studies have shown that, on average, men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years younger than ordinary men, and that women with intellectual disabilities have a younger 20 years of no disability.
The special Olympics keep us healthy by being lively and participate in sport.
The trainers taught us the food and health rules.
Special Olympics also provide free health screening of athletes who have difficulty communicating with a direct doctor or receiving health care.
At the 2015 Summer World Games, I played with my Canadian team members against the Nigerian basketball team.
The day before the game, the Nigerian basketball team underwent a private health examination of the world games, with 7 out of 10 players getting free crooms and making it clear for the first time.
The change that had changed was staggering.
They were more enthusiastic, happier and trust, because their coachs were able to contact them with words.
Their emotions because they were able to hear the voice of basketball, the voice of the skirant, and the fans in the guilders – this seems like a Muslim and his own.
The special Olympics do not change only to athletes.
It also changes their lives out of the stadium.
This year, research has shown that nearly half of adults in the United States do not know even someone with mental disabilities, and that 44 percent of Americans who have no personal contact with intellectual disabilities are acceptable to the other and are positive.
These are then the humiliating and humiliating words that prove that those with intellectual disabilities are still invisible for many people.
People serve them as just words or a path to humiliation.
I mentioned in the form of tweeting more than nine million times last year, it was very painful for me and for four million and five hundred athletes around the world.
It is not considered a lot to be insulted, but it's.
As my athlete colleague and global envoy John Frankin Stephens wrote in an open letter to the political critics who used them as insult, "Non's day of the special Olympics.
Let’s see if you're going to leave and haven’t changed inside you."
This year, at the 2015 Summer World Games, people stopped long for months to attend weight-raising finals.
All stood standing only when my colleague Jackie Barrett, a large of Newfoundland, raised 655 pound, and 611 pound up in the status of the berpers. This records a new record at the Special Olympics.
Jackie is the record holder of all athletes in Newfoundland – not only at the Special Olympics, but in the whole of heavier-filtering athlete.
Jackie Najma was a rumor in Los Angeles, and was immuddated by his performance.
Fifty years ago, a few thought that those with intellectual disabilities could do anything like that.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous Los Angeles Memorial Record to view the opening ceremony of the world Games and encourage athletes from 165 countries around the world.
Farwards�off, we were encouraged and celebrating us.
Special Olympics athletes have learned self-confidence and pride.
The special Olympics presented a lesson to the world that people with special needs deserve respect and containment.
Now I have my dream and ambitions associated with this sport, good instructors, respect and dignity, good health, and as a career as a personal instructor.
No longer have those who hide and are underground, and I have the oldest talk in TED.
The world has become a different place thanks to the special Olympics, but the road is still long.
So at the next time someone with a mental disability, please be able to see his abilities.
As the next time someone else is using those descending words, please tell him of the pain behind her.
Please think about participating in the special Olympics.
I'm to talk quite a last idea.
Nelson Mandela said, "Let's acquiesce to make a difference in the world."
The Special Olympics are working to change the world by introducing changes in 4 million and five hundred athletes and giving us the way to be confident, let us know friends, let us make no prejudices, feel that feels and be heroes.
Thank you very much.
Previously, you could not have heard about Kenema, Sierra Leone or Ora, Nigeria.
But I know that they are the most unusual place on Earth.
In hospitals there, there is a community of nurses, doctors and scientists quietly fighting one of the most deadly dangers of humanity for years: the virus of Lhas.
The Llast virus looks like Ebola much likes.
Severe diets can often be fatal.
But these people put their lives at risk every day to protect people in their communities, thus protecting all of us.
But one of the most unusual things I learned about them on one of my first visits there several years ago they were starting every morning -- these challenges, no days left in front lines -- rich.
They're coming together, and they show their joy.
They show their lives.
Over the Sunnis, year after year when I visit and visit me, I come with them, singing, writing, and telling this, because this we�lrichly not here are to pursue everyone, we are linked to our common humanity.
This is certainly, as you can imagine, it is very important, and I am fundamental, something to start change.
This is nothing big in March 2014, when the Ebola epidemic was declared in Guinea.
This is the first epidemic in West Africa, along with the borders of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
This was frightening, frightening to all of us.
We were in fact suspected for some time that was not from a more than expected, and we said it could come someday for Kenema.
Thus, some members immediately came out of my team and joined D. Humar Khan and his team there, and we numbered a diagnosis to be able to obtain partial sensitivity to me in Ebola if he came across the border and within Sierra Leone.
We're already numbering these tests for the Lassa virus, we knew how to do it, the team was remarkable.
We only had to give them the tools and space to look for Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day came from.
On May 23, 2014, a woman entered the hospital's maternity ward, and the team tested the first confirmed case of Ebulola in Sierra Leone.
This was an extraordinary job done.
They were able to diagnose the condition immediately, treating the patient safely and starting a tracking contact to see what happened.
He stopped something.
But by that day, the epidemic had broken out for months?
Hundreds of cases, he has already overshadowed all previous epidemics.
I come to Sierra Leone not as an individual case, but as a big wave.
We should have worked with the global community, with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema. Let's start facing those cases, bringing the next week 31, 92, and then 147 – all coming to Kenema, one of the only places in Sierra Leone can cope with this.
We have worked around the clock trying to do our shortest, trying to help these people, trying to attract attention, but we have also done something else.
From the sample we took from the patient's blood to discover Epola, we can go out, clearly.
The other thing we can do, actually, that we stop quantum, put it into a box and then sends it across the ocean, and that is what we did.
He sent him to Boston, where my team works.
We have worked around the clock that we are divided on alternates day by day, and quickly we produced 99 genes for Ebola virus.
This is the scheme - viral genome is the scheme.
We all have one.
He says everything inside, and says too much information.
The result of such a work is simple and strong.
We can already take these 99 different viruses, watch and compare them, and we can see, in fact, a comparison of three genes that have happened this and spread this from Guinea, we can get on start in the news of months ago, once for humans, and then move from one man to another.
Now that's very important, this is very important when you're trying to know how to interfere, but what's important thing is tracking.
We can also see that the virus is in human transport, it is about tone.
Each of this is very important, due to diagnosis, vaccinations, and the treatments we use, all of which are stated on this gene sequence, in the first place -- that is what this leads it.
World health experts must respond, you must develop, to examine everything they are doing.
But the way science is, and the place where I was at the moment, I had the possibility of working in a lot of many months, analyzing the most of the information carefully, having done the paper, when you're sowing and, finally, when the paper is published, we can disclose the information.
That's how the situation is currently in place.
Well, this wouldn't have it to be useful at this point, right?
We had friends in the front line and for us that what we need is help, a lot of help.
And the first thing we have done is, once the sequence came out of machines, publishing it online.
We have published the whole world and said, "Hon.
She came with help.
Before we knew her, he was being contacted from around the world, cheering information abroad there and his publication.
Some of the world’s greatest HIV followers suddenly became part of our society.
We were working together on this virtual road, regular calls, and continue to try to track the virus accurate, to find ways to stop it.
There are many ways in which we can be like these communities.
Everyone, especially when the epidemic began to spread globally, it was coming abroad to learn, to join, to fight, to fight.
Everyone wants to play a role.
The amount of human abilities abroad there was wonderful, and the Internet all brought us all.
You can imagine this instead of being afraid of each other, that's all we said, "Let're doing this.
Let’s work together, let's make this happen.”
But the problem was that the information we all use, online search, is very limited to do what we need.
This has many opportunities lost when this happened.
So in the early part of the epidemic in Kenema, we had recorded 106 cases of patients, and again we did this publicly available to the world.
In our coefficient, we could show that you could take 106 records, which could train the computer to predict and predict an Ebola with an accuracy of almost 100%.
We can publish this, to make this available to healthcare workers in the field.
But 106 is not enough to make this strong, to be installed.
So we are waiting for more information to be issued.
That information has not yet come.
We're still waiting, we're too far, in the silo instead of working together.
We cannot accept this.
Curved? You, all of you, cannot accept this.
It's our lives on the line.
Actually, we have lost much of the soul of healthcare workers, including dear colleagues, five colleagues of Malous Foni, Alex Alex Boi, D. Homar Khan, Alice Kufama and Mohamed Vola.
These are only five of the many health care workers in Kenema and around it while we wait and all do we work, calmly and alone.
So, then, Ebola, like all dangers to humanity, is a premise of mistrust, confusion and division.
When we build barriers between us and fight us, the virus thrives.
But not the rest of the dangers to humanity, Ebola is the only one in which we are all similar.
We are all in that war together.
Ebola on the threshold of someone could soon be on our thresholds.
So this is at the same weaknesses, the same points of strength, the same fears, the hopes, I wish to work together joy.
An applicant who graduated I was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and discovered the word "Kinima," the hospital where he works and the city in which he works in Sierra Leone, named from Mindy's word meaning "Treater like a river, open to the general. "
This was very deep to us, because without knowing this, we always felt that he honor people in Kenema where we were working, we had to work with openness, we had to share and work together.
We should have done so.
We must all demand this and others – let’s be open to us when another pandemic occurs, to fight this war together.
Because this is not the first Epiola epidemic and will not be the last, and there are many other microbes abroad waiting, such as the virus of Lasa and others.
The time coming for this happens, it can happen in a city of 2 million, it can start there.
It can be something that moves through air.
It can only be deliberate.
I know that this is frightening that I understand this, but I know, and I know, and this experience, that technology we have the ability to succeed on this thing, let’s be the upper word on the virus.
But we can only do it together and do it.
That is l. D.Khan and all those who have sacrificed their lives in the initial ranks of the war always with us, let them always be at war.
Let's not make the world know the devastated one virus, but it has done billions of hearts and minds working in unity.
Thank you.
