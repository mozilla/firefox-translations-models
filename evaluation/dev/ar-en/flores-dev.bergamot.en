I less important as lens manufacturers achieved higher standards in the lens production process.
This allowed for melting lens and miniatures to produce quality images similar to those achieved by stivative lenses.
Another disadvantage of humming lens is that the maximum opening (i, speed) for the lens is usually lower.
This makes the use of cheap chaker lenses difficult in poor lighting conditions without flames.

Time surrounds us and affects everything we do, but it’s hard to understand.
Religious, Philosophy and Science scientists have studied the time for thousands of years.

Synthetic thinking patterns are problem-solving methods that combine different ideas or areas for finding a solution.
This mental focus on speed, logic and accuracy, and also on the identification of facts and the re-application of existing technologies and the collection of information.
