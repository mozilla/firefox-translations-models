Well, this is a story about how we know what we know.
It's a story about this woman, Natalia Ribksinski.
She is an expert in ancient archaeology, which means that she is an expert in the discovery of dead organisms that are very ancient.
Natalia Ribksinski: Yes, some people call me "Doctor of the Dead".
Latif Nasser: I think it's particularly interesting because of the excavation sites for these objects, towards the top of the Arctic Circle in the Canadian tundra.
On a summer day in 2006, she was at the site of a well called the "Camel Bed", which is located less than 10 degrees from the latitude away from the attractive North Pole.
Natalia: Really, it won't seem too exciting, because you spend your entire day walking around with your backpack, a locating system and notebook and picking up anything that might seem like a dig.
Latifar Nasser: And at one point, I noticed something.
Natalya: Something rusty, a kind of rusty color, the size of my palm.
The tar was found on the roof.
Latif Nasser: At first I thought it was just a piece of wood, because such things had been found in that place before--parts of prehistoric plants.
But that night, on the way back to camp...
Natalya:... I took out the lens, carefully examined it and realized that it had no trace of tree rings.
It may be something carefully preserved, but it really looks like...
The bones.
Latif Nasser: Over the next four years, I went to the site again and again, and eventually collected 30 pieces of the same bone, most of them really small.
Natalya: Not a big group, as the small ziplock bag can handle it.
Nassar Latif: And I tried to put them together like puzzle pieces of a slice of paper.
But it seems challenging.
Natalia: It was broken into several small pieces, tried using sand and paste, but it doesn't look good.
Eventually, we used a 3D scanner.
Lethif Nasser: Oh! Natalia: Right?
Latif Nasser: It turns out that doing this is basically the easiest way.
Natalya: It's kind of magic when it fits together.
Latifar: How sure were you that you were doing it right, that you were putting it together the right way?
Is it possible to combine them in another way and get a barrack, for example?
Natalya: No, no, we got this.
لطيفار ناصر: What I found, I discovered, was the leg bone, the leg bone, and more specifically, belonged to the breed of mammals with a backbone, something like a cow or sheep.
But it was not possible for him to be one of them.
Kanar was too big.
Natalia: The size of this thing, immensely, was a large animal.
Latif Nasser: What kind of animal could it be?
She presented one of the fragments to some of her colleagues in Colorado, and they had an idea.
Natalya: We took a fountain, cracked a hole in it, and it smelled interesting.
Latif Nasser: It smelled like burnt meat.
And the smell that Natalya recognized was the skull cutting in the anatomical lab: collagen.
Collagen is what gives structure to our bones.
And usually, after many years, collapses.
But in this case, the Arctic region was like a natural frost and preserved it.
But a year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol, meeting a colleague named Mike Buckley who was explaining a new process he called "collagen footprinting".
It turns out that different varieties have slightly different collagen structures, so if you get a collagen composition from unknown bones, you can compare it with known varieties, and who knows, you might get a matching.
So she sent one of them to him, FedEx.
Natalya: Yes, you want to follow that, it's kind of important.
.Latif Nasser: He treated them, and compared them to 37 known species of mammals in our time.
And get a match.
It turns out that the 3.5 million-year-old bone found by Natalia from the Upper Arctic region dates back to...
The phrase.
Natalya: And you come to me, what?
Latif Nasser: They examined all the fragments, and got the same result.
However, based on the size of the bones discovered, this means that these phrases are 30 percent larger than the modern-day beauty.
This camel will be about 9 feet long and weigh about half a ton.
Yes, yes, it is.
Natalia found a beautiful column from the Arctic.
Now, when you hear the word "camel", what may come to mind is one of these, the two-legged camels from the Middle East and Central Asia.
But chances are the picture you have in mind is one of these, the only known, the essence of the desert creature-- expanding in hot sandy places like the Middle East and the desert, on its back an old, large-scale water storage mound for long desert journeys, has two large, wide feet to help it climb the sand dunes.
So how did one end up here in the upper Arctic?
Well, scientists have long known, as it turns out, even before Natalia's discovery, that beauty is actually of American origin.
They first appeared here.
For about 40 of the 45 million years, beauty was present, found only in North America, about 20 different species, and perhaps more.
Natalya: If I put them in a group, would they look different?
Latifar Nasser: Yes, you will have different sizes.
Some of them will have a very long neck, so that they actually look like a giraffe.
Latif Nasir: Some have noses, like crocodiles.
Natalya: In the beginning, they were actually small in size, almost like rabbits.
Lateef Nazar: What, a beautiful girl the size of a rabbit?
Natalya: The old one.
So you may not be able to recognize her.
Latif Nasser: My God, I want the animal alifa جمل-رنب.
Natalya: I know, wouldn't that be great?
Latef Nasser: About three or seven million years ago, a group of beauties headed for South America, where they became llama and alpacas, and another group crossed the land bridge of the Beringia to Asia and Africa.
Then, before the end of the last ice age, the beauty of North America had died out.
Scientists already knew all this, but it is still difficult to explain how Natalia found one in the far north.
The low temperature, the polar opposite to the desert.
Let's face it, three and a half million years ago, the average temperature was 22 degrees Celsius, warmer than it is now.
If it were a northern forest, it would be more like Yukon or Siberia today.
But still, for example, the length of winter will be six months as the ponds freeze.
Snowstorms could strike.
The night is 24 hours long.
Like, how is that... how?
How did one of the desert stars survive and survive in such polar conditions?
Natalia and her colleagues thought they had the answer.
Which is kind of awesome.
What if the features we imagine that make camels fit in places like the desert, actually evolved to help them weather the winter?
What if the sandy, wide feet were not supposed to fit the snow, like ski shoes?
What if that snack - which was a surprise to me, it did not contain water, but fat - was there to help camels cope with the six winter months.
And then, later, after crossing the bridge for a long time, did you adjust the winter features to adapt to the hot desert environment?
For example, a fat burner may be beneficial for beauty in hot climates because all fat is in one place, such as a fat backpack, meaning it does not need all of this insulation throughout the rest of the body.
Therefore, it helps to dissipate heat more easily.
This is a crazy idea, it seems like proof that the ideal desert nature could be evidence of an ancient Arctic.
I'm not the right person to tell you this story.
Others said it was a way to be amazed by evolutionary biology or a future key to climate change.
But I like it for a whole different reason.
For me, this story revolves around us, about how we see the world and how we change it.
I trained as a historian.
I knew that, in fact, many historians were also scientists.
They made the past logical.
It tells us the history of the universe and the planet we live on.
And as a historian, you start with an idea in your mind about how the story ends.
Natalya: We create stories and stick to them, like the camels in the desert, right?
This is a great story! it fits perfectly.
It is clear that he lived there forever.
Nasser: But at any moment, some evidence can be discovered.
Learning some little things can force you to reformulate everything you thought you knew.
For example, in this case, one scientist found a piece of what I thought was wood, and because of this, science has become a completely new and completely unbiased theory of what this creature looks like.
And for me, that's completely upside down the way I think about sentences.
Turning from a ridiculous creature suitable only for one specific environment, to a traveler in the world who happens to be in the desert, he could end up almost anywhere.
I present to you the Azuri.
"Ar-Azuri", hello, how are you?
Well, here, I got one of these for you.
Azar enjoys the "Azur" with a break from his usual hustle and bustle in the Music Hall of Radio City.
It's not just a joke.
However, the "Azure" is among us as a living reminder that the story of our world is alive.
It requires the willingness to adjust, and the habit of imagination.
Isn't that right, "Azuri"?
And our eyes are only a fraction of the way we see the world in a new way.
Thank you very much.
Today's computers are so amazing that we fail to notice how bad they are.
Today I would like to talk to you about this problem and how we can fix it with neuroscience.
I would like to first take you back to a cold night in the neighborhood in 2011 that had a profound impact on Ali.
I was sitting in a local bar outside Columbia University. where I studied computer science and neuroscience, I was with a fellow student in the middle of an interesting conversation about the ability of imagery to replace computers one day.
And as we approached the most exciting part of the conversation, the lights were on, of course.
He drew it up and looked at it and began to print.
Then he started to force his eyes to look at me and he said, "I'll give you full focus".
But of course, his eyes were glued to the hatch, and the moment died.
On the other side of the bar, I noticed another student holding his phone, this time with a group.
He was browsing the pictures on Instagram, and those boys were laughing hysterically.
And this twinning between my own grief and their happiness about the same technology made me think.
And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that the negative factor in the equation was not the digital information, but simply the screen position that separated me from my friend and was gathering among those boys.
As you can see, they were all gathered around something, just like our ancestors who developed their social profession telling stories about campfires.
And that's exactly the point of the tool, I guess.
Its role lies in the extent of our bodies' capabilities.
And I think computers today are doing the opposite.
Whether you're emailing your wife, composing a musical piece, or comforting a friend, you do it all pretty much the same way.
You bend over those rectangles, pressing buttons, tabs, and more rectangles.
And I'm afraid that this is the wrong way, I think we can use a machine closer to nature.
We must use machines that bring our work back to the real world.
We must use tools that use the principles of neuroscience to extend our emotions rather than narrow them down.
I wish I had such a machine with me.
The tar is called the Meta 2.
Let's try it out.
I see the audience right in front of me, and I see my hands.
And in three, two, one, we will see a spectral image, a very realistic spectral image, showing up in front of me, in front of my glasses that I am wearing now.
And this could be anything you buy or learn from, and I can use my hands and move them easily.
And I think Iron Man would be proud of it.
We'll get back to that in a few moments.
Now, if you are like me and your mind is probably not aware of the possibilities that this technology will allow us to achieve, let's look at some of them.
Amir is an architect, so it is natural that the first thing she imagined was to expand construction in three-dimensional space instead of using these two-dimensional schemes.
She's touching the artwork at the moment and choosing interior decoration.
All of this was captured through a GoPro camera through our own glasses.
This second use is unique to me, it is the professor's project to represent the glass brain, thanks to the University of California, San Francisco.
As a neuroscience student, I always dreamed of being able to learn and memorize all these complex brain structures with a real machine, enabling me to touch and manipulate different brain structures.
What you see is called augmented reality, but for me it is related to a more complex story - the story of how we can expand our body's capabilities with digital devices instead of doing the opposite.
Now, now...
I think that in the next few years, humanity will go through some transformation.
We will begin by putting a whole layer of digital information on the ground.
Imagine for a moment what this could mean for novelists, painters, brain surgeons, interior designers and perhaps all of us here today.
And what I think we need to do as a community is to try and make an effort to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that extends human experience, rather than making our reality a game or a trickle of digital information in it.
And that's my passion.
I want to share a little secret with you.
In five years - this is not the smallest device - in about five years, it will all look like glass tapes on our eyes showing spectral images.
And just as I don't care what kind of bias we buy about habits - we buy them because of the operating system - as a neuroscientist, I've always dreamed of building a mental operating system.
And it's important to do this the right way, because we may have lived inside these things at least our whole lives by the graphical interface of Windows.
And I don't know about you, but living inside a Windows system scares me.
To isolate the famous interface from the infinite, we use neuroscience to guide our design principles instead of leaving a group of designers fighting around it in the meeting room.
And the principle we all agree on is called "the least resistant neural pathway".
At each turn, we connect the brain with the brain for the first time, connecting the brain's specifications.
In the sense that we are trying to make a computer that is easy to use.
We build a system, and you've always known how to use it.
These are the first three design principles that we employ in this new user experience.
The first and most important principle is that you are the operating system.
Traditional file systems are complex and abstract, requiring your brain to do more to decipher them.
It works against the less resistant neural pathway.
While in augmented reality you can of course put the spectrum of the TED platform here, and the spectrum of your email on this side of the office, and your local memory has evolved to allow it to be found.
You can put a statue of the Tesla you want to buy - or whatever my legal team asked me to put before the show.
Great, your brain knows exactly how to get it back.
The second principle is called "touch of sight".
What do children do when they see something that catches their attention?
They try to reach out and touch him.
And this is exactly how a natural machine should work.
It turns out that the visual system receives a basic impulse from a feeling we call the reception of the deep sense-- it is the sense of perception of the internal organs.
So by directly touching our actions, we will not only be able to control it better, but we will also understand it more deeply.
And from him came the idea of "touching to see".
But it is not enough to experience things ourselves.
We are of the social hierarchy.
What leads me to the third element, the campfire depicted in our first story.
Our own corneal nerve cells suggest that we can communicate better with each other and with our work if we can see each other's faces and hands in three dimensions.
If you look at the video behind me, you will see users of a meta device playing with the same spectral image, communicating with their eyes, and connecting around this object, instead of being distracted by external devices.
Let's try this again with neuroscience in mind.
So, our favorite operating system, the mind operating system.
I'm going to take a step forward and take this glasses and leave them here by the office.
I am with you right now, we are in touch.
It works my local memory and I can take it and bring it to me, reminding me that I am the system of play.
And my sense of reception is at work, and I can blow these glasses into millions of pieces and touch the magnetic touch that is wiping my handprint now.
But seeing things alone is not enough, in a second my partner will make a 3D call --?
How are things going?
I can see it in three dimensions in front of me.
And it is very realistic.
Thank you.
This will replace the excitement according to the neuron cell in the near future.
How are things going?
: Great we are on live.
:ar, give the audience the spectral brain gift we saw in the video above.
This will not only change our mood, but also the way we work together.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
:ar are welcome.
This is the message I discovered in that bar in 2011: The future of computers is not in any of these screens.
It's here, inside all of us.
If there is one idea I want to share with you, it is that the natural machine is not a fantasy of the future, but it is here in 2016.
For all the hundred people at Meta, including the management team, CEOs, designers and engineers - and before TED2017, we'll throw away the screens of our computers and replace them with a truly natural machine.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, I appreciate that.
Thank you all.
:ar informs me of one thing. because I have made a few illustrations of augmented reality over the past year or so.
There is a dispute among technologists about whether we actually see something real on screen.
There is a question of the field of vision, in which the technology shows us a wider vision than can be seen through the mirror.
Was what we saw real?
:ar certainly.
Not only that, but we took extra precautions to take it through lenses with a GoPro camera in the various shots we witnessed.
We want to simulate the real experience we see through the mirror, without any trickery.
:ar: Thank you for showing us that..: I appreciate that, thank you so much.
I'm from the freest, most tolerant, most advanced place in the United States, Seattle, Washington.
I grew up in a large family from Seattle.
Amaar was an artist, my father was a university professor, and I am really grateful to them for raising me, because I always felt completely comfortable planning my life exactly the way that suits me.
In fact, I have taken a different path from what my father was planning.
When I was 19, I left the university - I left, I got kicked out, you can say whatever you want.
Then I took a career as a professional French trumpet player, which was my dream.
The musical has played throughout the United States and Europe, and toured for a few years with the great jazz guitarist Charlie Bird.
In my late twenties, I became a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
It is greater than life.
And to learn, Voldeys never complained.
Instead, he supported me along the way.
It wasn't a dream.
They used to tell their neighbors and friends, "Our son, on a decade-long break".
And yet there was a lively conversation about lifestyle I wanted to share with you.
I was 27 years old, returning home from Barcelona, visiting my parents for Christmas, cooking dinner with my mom and being alone in the kitchen.
And Karar was quiet, very quiet.
There was something wrong.
I said, "Mommy, what is going on in your mind?"
"Your father and I are really worried about you", answered Ar.
I said, "What?" I mean, what's the matter, now?
"I want you to be completely honest with me: Were you a Republican?"
Well, the truth is, I wasn't a politician, I was just a French trumpet player.
But I was fascinated by the discoveries, and they had already revealed it, and that caused some confusion.
As you can see, I was fascinated by capitalism, and I want to tell you why.
It seems to me that this is always of interest whether you believe it or not, in poverty.
As you can see, when I was a kid growing up in Seattle, I remember the first time I saw real paragraphs.
We were a family from the lower middle class, but that's certainly not real poverty.
This is never near.
The first time I saw poverty, and the face of poverty, was when I was six or seven years old, in the early seventies.
And it was like many of you, an irregular, miserable example.
The National Geographic magazine featured a picture of a child my age in East Africa, with flies on his face and a swollen belly.
And Lingar was not his destiny, I was aware of it but I could not do anything.
Some of you may remember that picture, not exactly that picture, but any picture like it.
It has introduced the West to the extreme poverty that exists around the world.
Well, that vision followed me until I grew up and went to school, and then left and went back to school and started to form my family.
And I wondered, what happened to that baby?
Or for people like him around the world?
I started studying, and although I wasn't in school, I was looking for the answer: What happened to the world's poorest people?
Did their condition worsen, improve, or what?
I found the answer, and it changed my life, and I want to share that with you.
As you can see--most Americans believe that poverty has become worse than it has been since we were children, since they witnessed that vision.
If you ask Americans, "Is the global poverty situation getting worse or better?" 70% of people will answer that hunger has worsened since the early 1970s.
But that's the truth.
This is the discovery that changed my mind.
Since 1970, the percentage of the world's population living on hunger levels has been living on a dollar or less per day, and with adjustments to inflation, this percentage has decreased by 80 percent.
There has been an 80% reduction in the world's worst poverty since I was a child.
And I didn't even know that.
This, my friends, is a miracle.
This is something we should celebrate.
It is the greatest achievement against poverty in human history, and it has happened in our lifetime.
When I found out, I wondered what we could do about it and how it became possible.
If you don't know why, you can't do it again.
If you want to do it again and get two billion people out of poverty, that's what we've been talking about since I was a kid, at least two billion of those, our brothers and sisters, have been lifted out of poverty.
I want another two billion so I wanted to know why.
And I started looking for the answer.
And it wasn't a political answer, because I didn't care.
You know, I still don't care.
I wanted the best answer from economists of the left, right and center.
And here we are.
These are the reasons.
These are five reasons why we have lifted two billion of our brothers and sisters out of poverty since I was a child.
First, globalization is the issue.
Secondly, free trade.
Thirdly, the property rights.
Fourth: the rule of law.
The fifth: creating projects.
This was due to the free-market economy that spread around the world after 1970.
Right now, I'm not naive.
I know that free enterprises are not perfect, I know that free enterprises are not all we need to build a better world.
But this is awesome.
And away from politics.
That's what I've learned, that's what I've discovered.
Capitalism is not just about accumulation.
Because at its best, it is ambition, which many people on this platform talk about, ambition that comes from dreams and is an integral part of the free-market economy.
And we have to share it with more people.
Now, I want to introduce you to the second discovery, which is related to the first discovery and which I believe will contribute to the evolution not only around the world, but here at home.
The best saying I've heard to summarize the ideas I told you just now about getting people out of poverty is this: "Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history.
I have lifted billions of people out of poverty".
Who said that?
He looks like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
This is wrong.
President Barack Obama is the one who said that.
Why do I know this by heart?
Because he told me so.
It's crazy.
And I said, "Hallelujah".
But more than that, I said, "What a chance".
Do you know what I was thinking?
This was during an event we were doing on this topic at Georgetown University in May 2015.
I thought, this is the solution to the big problem facing America today.
It is centered around these ideas, liberals and conservatives, to help people who are in dire need of us.
Right now, I won't have to tell anyone in this room that we are in a crisis, in America and many countries around the world, that is related to political polarization.
It has risen to critical crisis levels.
This is not pleasant and not true.
There was an article last year in the News of the National Academy of Sciences, one of the most prestigious papers published in the West.
An article was published in 2014 about the political movement's inconsistency.
This is what psychologists call the assumption that your belief is based on love but your opponent's belief is based on hate.
This is common in global conflicts.
This is expected to be seen between Palestinians and Israelis, for example.
What the author of this article found was that in America today, most Republicans and Democrats suffer from a lack of political coherence.
The majority of political activists in our country today believe that they are motivated by love, while the other side is motivated by hatred.
Think about it, think about it.
Most people say, "You know, my faith is based on compassion, I want to help people, but other people are worse off and are watching me".
You cannot evolve as a society when you suffer from this kind of disagreement.
That's not possible.
How do we find a solution to this?
Well, first, let's be honest: there are differences.
Let's not underestimate the differences. that would be a kind of naivete.
There is a lot of good research on this.
One of the oldest TED speakers is my friend Jonathan Hayed.
He is a clinical psychologist at New York University.
He conducts studies on the beliefs, values and morals of several people to discover how they differ.
It has proven, for example, that conservatives and liberals have different priorities in what they believe is important.
For example, John Hayditt has proven that liberals care about poverty 59 percent more than they care about economic freedom.
Conservatives are 28 percent more concerned with economic freedom than they are with poverty.
The differences are contradictory, aren't they?
And we will never agree.
This is the diversity in which our strength lies.
Remember what brought the poor out of their poverty.
It was this obsession with poverty, linked to the way economic freedom has spread around the world.
We need each other, or in other words, if we want to help people and lift another two billion people out of poverty.
There is no other way.
Hmm.
How are we going to do that?
It's a bit confusing, isn't it?
We need creative thinking.
A lot of them are on this platform.
Creating social projects Yes, of course, distinctive.
We need to invest overseas in a sustainable, ethical and responsible manner.
But do you know what we really need?
We need a new day with a flexible ideology.
We should be less predictable.
Isn't that right?
Do you feel that your beliefs are beginning to become predictable?
Traditional car in some way?
Do you feel like you always listen to people who agree with you?
Why is this dangerous?
Because when we talk in this country about economics, about the emperor, about the conservatives, you always talk about taxes, laws and big government.
On the left, liberals, you talk about economics, it's always about income inequality.
These things are important now, very important to me, very important to you.
But when it comes to rescuing people who are starving and need us, these will distract.
We need to unite together and agree on the best ways to alleviate poverty using the best means at our disposal, and this can be achieved when the Conservatives recognize their need for liberals and their hunger for poverty, and the Liberals' need for conservatives and their hunger for free trade.
This is the diversity where the future power of this country, if we choose it, lies.
So how are we going to do it, how are we going to do it together?
I've got some rules of work, not just for you, but for me too.
First, rule of thumb: Remember, it's not good enough to tolerate those who disagree with you.
This is not good enough.
We must remember that we need different people with us, because there are people who need us all who are still waiting for these means.
Now, what will you do, and how will you express it?
Where does this start?
You know, we're all in this room now blessed.
We are blessed with people who listen to us.
We are blessed with prosperity, we are blessed with leadership.
When others hear us, with this kind of unexpected ideology, people can listen.
Perhaps we can move forward toward that point.
This is the number one. number two.
Number two: I ask you and I ask myself to be that person who crosses barriers, the mysterious person, who is difficult to classify.
If you are a conservative, be that conservative person who always strives about poverty and the moral duty to be a poverty fighter.
If you are a liberal, be a liberal who always talks about the beauty of free markets to solve our problems when used responsibly.
If we do that, we'll have two things.
First, we should start working on the next two billion and be the solution we have seen a lot in the past and need to see more of in the future.
Second, we may be able to change the terrible holy ideological war that we are suffering in this country and turn it into a contest of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
And then, perhaps, just maybe, we'll realize that our biggest differences aren't really that big of a difference.
Thank you.
When I was at university.. I specialized in government work which meant I had to write a lot of papers,
Now when any average student writes a paper, his schedule looks like this.
As you can see, the work may be slow at first, but you'll get it done in the first week long enough to see the next few days as productive and kind.
And I wish I could do it the same way,
This is how the plan will be.
I'm going to start writing the schedule to get started, then it's time to write it down and I end up like this!
And this happens in every piece of paper I write.
Until he asked me to write a 90-page dissertation, a paper we were supposed to work on all year long!
And for a paper like this, the usual work schedule was not an option.
Because the project was too big.
I started planning the project, and decided that the schedule should look something like this.
This is how you will spend the year..
I will start with the lightweight work, then I will increase the effort a little in the middle of the year, and at the end of the year I will work as hard as I can.. it will be as easy as climbing a ladder, a grade.
How difficult can it be to climb the stairs?
It's not the big deal, is it?
But the strangest thing happened to me..
In the first months of the year,
It came and went quickly, and I couldn't accomplish anything.
I decided to change my plan a little.
Then... but in fact the middle of the year passed quickly, and I didn't write a word.
The shortening of the two months to one month.. then to two weeks..
And one day I woke up, and there were only three days left to deliver!! and I had not written a word yet, so the only thing I could do was write 90 pages in 72 hours, and go on two whole days without sleep.. and no humans should go two days without sleep, I hurried to the university, in a slow motion I delivered the paper on the exact date!
I thought I had done everything.
About a week later, I got a call, it was a call from the university.
They asked, "Are you Tim Urban?"
Far replied: "Yes".
They said: "We need to discuss your thesis with you"..
I said: "Well. "
They said, "It's the best thesis we've ever seen!"
This did not happen in reality,
It was a bad thesis to the extent that it was a bad thesis.
I just wanted to enjoy the moment when you thought: "This guy is amazing"!
No, no, it was so bad.
Anyway, today I am a writer and blogger on the internet..
I write in a blog post called "Wait but why?"
Two years ago, I decided to give up the leak and postponement.
My actions have always puzzled the wrongdoers around me and why I postpone my business, so I wanted to explain to them and to the world what goes on in the minds of those who postpone and postpone their business, and why we are like this.
I had a theory that the minds of the wicked really differ from other people's.
And to test this, I found a lab that allowed me to use an MRI machine to image the brain and brain of another postponed man so I could compare them,
And I brought the pictures with me to see for yourselves today,
Now I want you to take a closer look to see if there is any difference.
I know that not all of you are experts, and it's not clear, but just look, okay?
So here is an image of a brain that does not delay,
And now..
Here is a picture of my brain.
There is a difference.
Both minds contain but the mind of the pervert also contains
Now, what does this mean for the vacuum cleaner?
It means that everything is fine until this happens..
The man said: "This is the perfect time to get the job done" the monkey: "No!" if he does something useful and productive. but the monkey doesn't like the plan, so the monkey takes the wheel and says: why don't we read the entire Wikipedia page about the Nancy and Tonya scandal because I just remembered that this happened!
Then we'll go to the fridge and see if anything has changed in the last 10 minutes.
After that, we'll enter the YouTube series that begins with videos of Richard Feynman talking about the magnet and ends after a very long time with interviews with Justin Bieber's mother.
Monkey: "All this will take time, and there is no room for anything to do today.
"I'm sorry!" he said.
Now, what is going on here!
This monkey doesn't look like someone you want to be a leader behind the wheel.
He lives entirely in the present moment,
He has no memory of the past and no knowledge of the future.. he only cares about two things: "easy and fun".
In the animal world, this is happening ideally.
If you were a dog, and did nothing but the easy and fun, then you were successful in every way!
For apes, humans are just another species of animals.
They eat, sleep and reproduce, which would be normal in early times.
But, in case you haven't noticed, we're not in those times.
We live in an advanced and civilized age and the monkey doesn't know what that means.
And that is why there is a "ar" in our heads, which gives us abilities that no other animal can do,
We can imagine the future,
We can see the full picture here.
And we can make long-term plans.
The decision maker will take all of this into account,
And he wants us to do only what seems right and logical to do right now.
And sometimes doing something seems both logical and fun at the same time, like going to dinner or going to bed, or enjoying your free time.
That's why there is a confusion between logical and fun.
Sometimes they agree,
And at other times, it seems more logical to work on something difficult and unpleasant for the greater good.
And here is where the contradictions occur.
For the pessimist, this contradiction always ends in the same way, causing him to spend most of his time in the orange zone, a pleasant, easy zone completely separate from the realm of logic.
I'm naming it.
Now, a place you all know well, you lads.
A place where leisure activities take place in a time that is not actually leisure.
The fun you have in Mar is not really fun, because it is totally unmerited and the atmosphere around you is filled with guilt, sorrow, anxiety and self-loathing, all beautiful miserable feelings..
And the question when the monkey is behind the wheel is: how does the rider move himself to the blue zone, a zone where things happen less fun and easy but much more importantly..
Well, it turns out that the procrastinator has a guardian angel, someone who is constantly watching him and watching him in the darkest and darkest of times.. someone called a person.
Now he sleeps most of the time.. but he wakes up suddenly, when any deadline is very close or there is a risk of embarrassment to people, loss of a job, or any scary outcome..
And most importantly, it is the only thing that scares the monkey.
Now, this monster has become connected to my life recently, because TED conference officials contacted me six months ago and invited me to speak on it.
Of course I said: Yes, it has always been my dream to have a child.
I have spoken at a TED conference in the past.
And amid all the excitement, the decision maker was thinking of something else.
Kanar said: "Are we clear about what we agreed to just now?
Do we know what will happen in the future?
We should sit down and talk now".
The monkey said: "I totally agree with you, but how about we open up Google Maps, close the image to the bottom of India and explore it for two and a half hours until we reach the top of India, to educate ourselves about this country".
That's what we did that day.
6 months turned into 4 then 2 then 1 month..TED decided to announce the speakers at the conference,
And when I opened the site, I found a picture of my face staring at me.
And guess who's awake?
He started losing his mind and in seconds the system turned into chaos.
And the monkey got up - remember, the monkey is afraid of the monster of terror - and ran up to the tree!
And finally, he was able to pick up the punch and start working on the lecture.
Now he represents all sorts of crazy behaviors in the reader, such as how I was able to spend two weeks of all sorts of behaviors writing one sentence in my dissertation, and then, surprisingly, the words come in two days straight to write 8 pages!
This case is complete with all three characters, this is the system of the conjurer.
It's not pretty, but it works.
And that's what I decided to write on the blog two years ago.
And when I wrote, I was overwhelmed by the answers,
I have received thousands of messages from all kinds of people, from all over the world, working all kinds of jobs.
Among them were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers and many more, many PhD students,
And they all said they were writing the same thing: "I have the same problem".
What amazed me was the contrast between the lightness of his words and the weight of these letters,
These people were writing with great frustration about what the monkey had done to them in their lives, what this monkey had done to them.
And when I thought about it, I said to myself: If the sorting system works, what happens?
Why are these people so frustrated?
It turns out that there are two types of manipulation,
Everything I talked about today, all the examples, all of them have a deadline.
And when there are deadlines, the effect of procrastination is contained and pressed short-term to intervene.
But there is another type of procrastination, a type that occurs in circumstances that have no deadline.
For example, if you want to start a freelance work, something in art, or a pioneering work... these works do not have a deadline at the beginning, because nothing happened from the beginning.
There are also plenty of important activities outside of your business and not including deadlines.. such as visiting your parents or sports and taking care of your health, working to develop your relationships, or cutting bad ties..
Now, if the only way to end these difficult things is through the road, there is a problem, because in all these important works that do not contain deadlines the beast will not appear.
Therefore, the effect of procrastination will not be contained and thus, these works will continue and extend forever..
And this is the kind of long-term settlement that is not seen and not talked about as much as the first type: fun, short-term and with deadlines.
And usually people with type 2 calmness and privacy suffer.
And this kind of disclosure can be a great source of long-term grief and regret.
I thought: That is why these people write to me, and that is why they are in such a bad situation.
Not because they are targeting a particular project,
Blaar because of that long-term delay that made them look like spectators, sometimes, on their own lives.
Their frustration is not because they have not achieved their dreams, but because they have not been able to pursue them from the ground up.
While I read the letters, I was inspired: I don't think there is anyone who doesn't postpone his work,
That's right, I think you're all wronged,
Of course, you may not be as messy as some of us, and some of you may be good at dating and sticking to dates, but remember: the secret monkey trick is when there is no deadline.
Now, I want to show you one last thing..
I call this:
Each square represents a week in a 90-year life,
There doesn't seem to be many of them, especially since we've used many of them before.
I think we all need to take a closer look at this schedule.
And we should think about what we really delay, because each of us has something to delay in our lives.
We must beware of the monkey of instant pleasure,
This is a duty for all of us.
And because there aren't that many boxes in the table, you should start this task today.
Ummm, maybe not today but..
As you know,
In the near future...
Thank you.
We were there, souls and bodies full of people in a Texas church on the last night of our lives.
They are stacked in a room like this, but with a wooden chair with a grim, annoying sound covered in a red haired cloth, with an organ on the left, a coral from the back and a baptismal font placed on the wall behind them.
A room like this, but not a room like this.
With the same strong sense of excitement, the same deep hope for salvation, the same sweat in the palm of the hand and the same people who do not listen behind the scenes.
It was December 31, 1999, the night of Christ's second coming, and the end of the world as I know it.
That year I reached twelve years of age and became responsible.
And once I stopped complaining about how embarrassing it is for Christ to return once again, once I became responsible for everything I had done, I decided that it would be best for me to solve my problems with the speed limit.
That's why I went to church as much as I could.
I listened to the silence with the same intensity as someone would listen to the noise, trying to make sure that God had not deceived me and decided to return early.
And in case he did, I would have prepared an alternative plan, reading the "Leaved Behind" series, which was the last fashion scream of the time.
I found among her pages that if I didn't get the erection at midnight, I would try again.
All he had to do was avoid being taunted by the beast with his mark, fighting demons, willful ones, and the enemy of Christ himself.
It's going to be hard - but I know I can do it.
Now, however, the time for planning has run out.
It was 11:50 p.m.
We have ten minutes left, and a priest invited us from the chairs and even the altar because he wanted the prayer to be held when midnight came.
That is why every faction of the sects has taken its place.
The coral reigns on his throne, the shamsha and their wives - or the christened bourgeois as I like to call them - took the first place in front of the altar.
You see, in America, even the Second Coming of Christ has a section for adults.
Behind the barbarians, who were baptized, were the elderly - those men and women whose young back burned in the scorching sun in the cotton fields of east Texas, and whose skin looked tinged - by the burning - with a noble brown color, just like the clay of east Texas, whose hopes and dreams of what life outside east Texas might be like were shattered and shattered.
Yes, for me, these men and women were the stars of the show.
They waited their whole lives for that moment, just as their ancestors from the Middle Ages to the end of the world waited, just as my grandmother waited for the Oprah Winfrey show on Channel 8 every day at four o'clock.
And just as she made her way to the altar, I snuck right behind her, because I knew for sure that my grandmother would definitely go to heaven.
And I thought that if I held her hand during this prayer, I might be going in the right direction with her.
So I held on and closed my eyes to listen, to wait.
The sound of the Salaat became louder.
And yet the cries of response to the call to prayer continue to rise even higher.
The organ continued to add the funeral hymn.
And then came the heat to add sweat.
I held my hand even more firmly, so that I wouldn't be the one left in the void.
I closed my eyes so hard that I could not see the vomit separating the fat.
Then a voice from above us said, "Amen".
It's almost over.
I looked at the clock.
It was after midnight.
I looked to the older believers who had not yet had their deliverer, who were so proud that they seemed to be in no way disappointed, who had long believed that they would now begin to doubt.
But I was angry instead of them.
They have been deceived, deceived, misled, and have been in harmony with them all along.
I prayed their prayers, I avoided temptation as much as I could.
I hit my head not once, but twice in the baptism pool that pushes me to the pier.
I believe in you.
And now what?
I arrived home just in time to turn on the TV and watch "Peter Jennings" announce the beginning of the new millennium as he toiled around the world.
It seemed to me that it would be strange, however, for Christ to return time and again according to different time zones.
And that made me feel ridiculous - even more painful, really.
That night, I didn't give up on faith.
But I believed something new: that it is possible not to believe.
It is possible that the answers I had were wrong, that the questions themselves were wrong.
Now, once upon a time, where there was a mountain of certainty, there was a spring of doubt rolling toward its base, a spring of promise in the rivers.
I can follow all the drama in my life since that night in church when my savior didn't come; when it became clear that what I believed for sure, if not a lie, was at least not the truth.
While most of you are preparing for the new millennium in a completely different way, I am sure you are here because part of you have done the same thing that you have done since the beginning of this new century, since my mother left and my father stayed away and my father refused to come.
I reached out my hand, looking for something I believed in.
When I arrived at Yale University at the age of eighteen, I remained confident that my trip from Oak Leaf, Texas, was an opportunity to leave behind all the challenges I knew, shattered dreams, and shattered bodies I had seen.
But when I found myself on one of the winter holidays in my hometown lying on the ground, with my hands tied behind my back and the thief's gun pointed at my head, I realized that even the best education could not save me.
I have endured when I was an intern at Lehman Brothers Bank in 2008.
I was hopeful - I even called home to tell my family that we would never be poor again.
But I witnessed the collapse of this temple of money before my eyes, and I realized that even the best job could not save me.
I had endured when I came to Washington as a young employee, heard a voice from "Illinois" shout, saying "It's been a long time, but in this election, there will be a change in America".
But since Congress has stopped and the state has collapsed and hope and change have started to look like a cruel joke, I realized that even the second political advent could not save me.
I have knelt faithfully before the altar of the American dream, glorifying the gods of time with success, money, and power.
But over and over again, I open my eyes to find that all those gods are dead.
From that tomb, I began to search again, not because I was brave, but because I realized that I had to believe or die.
That's why I went to Hajj but to another place besides Mecca, Harvard Business School, realizing this time that I would not be able to accept the salvation that was supposedly offered.
No, I knew there would be more work to do.
The work began from a dark spot at a crowded party, late on the eve of the beginning of the bitter Cambridge winter, when three friends and I asked a question that young people who had been looking for something real for a long time had asked: What if we took a road trip?
We didn't know where we could go or how to get there, but we knew we had to do it.
Because as Jack Kirroke wrote all our lives, we've been "sneaking in at night and disappearing somewhere", and we go to find out what people are doing all over the country.
So, despite other voices saying the risk was too high and success was uncertain, we went anyway.
In the summer of 2013, we traveled 8,000 miles across the Americas, between Montana's cattle ranches, the Detroit slums, and the swamps of New Orleans, where we found and worked with men and women who were creating small projects where impact is the focus.
And since we are trained at the military academy of capitalism, we were surprised by this revolutionary idea.
When the idea spread, and became a nonprofit organization called "MEAS Across America", that movement made me stand here on this platform.
It has spread because we have found great talent in our generation in order to find purpose and meaning.
It has spread because we have found an endless number of entrepreneurs in the staff and dark corners of America who were creating jobs and changing lives and needing little help.
But to be honest, it has spread because I fought to spread it.
There were no limits to what I could do to preach this gospel and to make more people believe that we can endure a broken nation, one social project at a time.
But it was that missionary journey that led me to the very different gospel that I came to share with you today.
It all started one night almost a year ago at the Natural History Museum in New York, at the Harvard Business School graduation ceremony.
Under the full-size version of the whale, I sat with the giants of our time where they celebrated their beauty and good deeds.
There was a sense of pride where capital and assets under management exceeded half a trillion dollars.
We've reviewed everything we've done, and it's been good.
But it happened, two days later, that I had to travel north to Harlem, where I found myself sitting on a town farm that was once empty land, listening to a man named "Tony" talk to me about the children who come there every day.
Where they all live below the poverty line.
Many of them carry all their belongings in their backpack to avoid losing them in a homeless shelter.
Some of them were brought to the Tony show, called "Growing Harlem", to get their one meal a day.
Tony told me that he started the "growing Harlem" with his retirement money after working as a taxi driver for twenty years.
He told me that he was not paying himself, because despite his success, the program still lacks resources.
He told me that he could take any help he could get.
And I was there as a person to help.
But as soon as I left Tony, I felt burning and tears falling from my eyes.
I was inspired to sit in one room with a few hundred people with half a trillion dollars, and then two days later in another room, 50 blocks north, where a man who doesn't get paid provides a child with her only meal a day.
It wasn't the outright inequality that made me cry, nor the idea of hunger, or homeless children, nor the anger toward the one percent, nor the pity toward the 99.
No, I was confused because I finally realized that I was like a kidney washer for a country that needed a kidney transplant.
I realized that my story revolves around all those who wait for them to solve their problems themselves even if they don't have the resources to do so; my organization revolves around all the structural and systemic assistance that has never reached Harlem, Appalachia, or the Lower Ninth Ward; my voice revolves around all those voices that seem mute, dirty, and unequipped.
And the shame of it, that shame that overwhelms me as much as the shame of sitting in front of the TV watching Peter Jennings announce the beginning of the new millennium again and again and again.
I was deceived, deceived, deceived.
But this time, I was the fake loyalist.
As you can see, I have come a long way from that altar on the night I thought the world was coming to an end, from a world where people speak a vague language and see suffering as a divine law and take the text as an unacceptable fact.
Yes, I have improved a lot by returning to the position from which I started.
Because it's simply not true to say that we live in an age of atheism - no, we believe today as much as ever.
Some of us may believe in the prophecy of "Briné Brown" or "Tony Robbins".
We may believe the New Yorker as the Bible or the Harvard Business Review.
We may even feel a deeper sense of faith when we worship here at TED, but we desperately want to believe, we need to believe.
We speak the language of attractive and influential leaders who promise to solve all our problems.
We view suffering as a necessary law of capitalism, that is our god, we accept the halfway point of technological progress as an unacceptable fact.
And we rarely realize the human cost we pay when we fail to doubt a single step, because we fear that it will undermine our entire organization.
But if you are confused by the unreasonable things we must accept, then it must be time to be held accountable.
I therefore do not have the Gospel of the Disorder or the Renewal or "TBL".
I don't have the gospel of faith to share with you today.
In fact, what I have and what I offer is the Gospel of Doubt.
The Bible does not ask you to stop believing, but to believe something new: that it is possible to not believe.
It is possible that the answers we have are wrong, that the questions themselves may be wrong,
Yes, the Bible of Doubt means that it is possible that we are wrong on this stage, in this room.
Because it raises the question of why?
With all the power at our disposal, why do humans still suffer so much?
This suspicion led me to participate, and we disrupted our organization "MBAS across America" out of business.
We have dismantled the staff and closed our doors and will share our sample free of charge with anyone who thinks they can do the job without waiting for our approval.
This doubt forced me to abandon the role of the Savior entrusted to me by some, because our time is too short and our opportunities too far to wait for her second coming, when the truth is that there will be no miracles here.
This doubt, it nourishes me and gives me hope that when our problems are overwhelmed, when the drops are revealed and seem to lead to our death, when the healer does not offer any relief to our wounds, our faith will not be blinded - rather, it will be our humble doubt that sheds some light on the darkness of our lives and world and allows us to raise our voices to whisper.
Or to shout or simply say, in the utmost simplicity, "There must be another way".
Thank you.
A food crisis.
News that appears in the news every day.
But what is a "narrative"?
Food shortages in some parts of the world or may be severe.
In other areas, genetically modified foods are saving the world.
Could it be that the problem is the processed food?
Too much waste is thrown into the sea, creating bad oceans, toxic oceans, and poor nutrition.
And it will never go on like this.
And I see that the current climate for this debate is horribly unconstructive.
So how can we bring this closer to something we can understand?
How is this apple a food crisis?
You must have all eaten an apple last week.
How old do you think this apple is from the moment it is cut?
Two weeks?
Citizens?
11 months -- which is the average age of apples in grocery in developing states.
And I don't expect the average to be very different in Europe or anywhere else in the world.
We cut them off, put them in cold cabinets and then fill the cabinets with gas - there is in fact documented evidence of cases where workers tried to enter these environments to retrieve apples, and died, due to the indoor air used to slow the process of apple poisoning in humans.
How come none of you knew about this before?
Why didn't I know this before?
Ninety percent of the quality of that apple - all antioxidants - is gone by the time we get it.
So that you become literally a sugar ball.
How did we become so little informed and how can we improve?
I think what we're missing is software.
I know software -- I know computers, I got connected to the Internet when I was a kid.
I did some really weird stuff-- on this show.
But I met Benasar, and I was able to express myself.
How do you express yourself in food?
If we had a program, we might feel pressured to ask: What if?
For me, I asked: What if the climate was democratic?
This is a climate map of the world.
The regions with the highest green production and the lowest red production are also affected.
They exchange and change, and California farmers are now Mexican farmers.
China takes land from the Brails to grow better food, and we are slaves to the climate.
What if every country had its own productive climate?
What will this change in the way we live?
What will this change about the quality of life and food?
The problem with the previous generation was that we needed more food and we needed it to be cheaper.
Welcome to your global farm.
We have built a giant model of a farm.
All these tracks--they are tracks of cars, planes, trains and wheels.
It is a miracle that we feed 7 billion people, even though only a few of us are involved in food production.
What if..
We build a digital farm?
It's a global digital farm.
What if you could take this apple, number it somehow, send it through particles in the air, and then reassemble it at the other end?
What if?
I'm going to read a few of these words. They inspired me to do what I do.
The first is: "Japanese agriculture has no youth, no water, no land, and no future". This is what I came to know on the day I visited Minamisanerki in southern Fukushima, after the disaster.
The children turned to Sandear and Tokyo, where the land was contaminated, importing seventy percent of their food.
But this is not a Frida to Japan.
Two percent of the U.S. population is involved in agriculture.
What good answer can come from two percent of the population of any country?
When we travel around the world, 50 percent of Africa's population is under the age of 18.
Eighty percent do not want to become farmers.
Farming is difficult.
The life of a small-scale farmer is a mess.
They're going to the city.
In India: Farming families unable to access basic services, the number of farmers who committed suicide this year and last year is higher than the previous 10.
It's uncomfortable to talk about this.
Where are they going?
To the city.
No young people, and everyone is noticing.
So how do we build this program that inspires young people?
Welcome to the new farm tractor.
This is a compilation.
In previous years, I went to Bed Bath, Beyond, and Home Depot and started dating.
I built trivial things and made plants dance and I got them on a computer and killed them all - a lot.
Eventually, I saved them.
And I created one of the most intimate relationships I've ever had, because I was learning the language of plants.
I wanted to make it bigger.
They say, "Do this, boy!
This is an old, unwanted electronic room.
What can you do?"
My team and I built a farm inside the Media Lab, a place unknown throughout history with nothing about biology but everything about virtual life.
Within these 60 square feet we produced enough food to feed 300 people once a month--not much food.
And there's a lot of exciting technology out there.
But what's the most exciting thing?
Beautiful white roots, deep green colors and urban harvest.
Is this the new cafeteria?
Is this the new retail experience?
Is this the new grocery store?
I can say one thing for sure: this is the first time someone in a media lab has rooted anything.
We get power in bags; there's nothing wrong with that.
But what happens when you have a photo-based processor, a data scientist, pulling roots and thinking, "Huh. I know something about--I can get this done, I want to try it".
In this process we will take out plants and take some of them to the lab, because when you plant and grow them, you don't throw them away; they are kind of precious to you.
I have this strange tongue right now, because I'm afraid I'll let someone eat anything before I eat it first, because I want it to be good.
So I eat lettuce every day and I can tell the acidity of the lettuce until eleven.
I said, "No, that's 6.1 -- no, no, you can't eat today".
The lettuce that day was very sweet.
The vegetable was very sweet because the plant was exhausted and had created a chemical reaction in the plant to protect itself: "I will not die!"
And the plant that will not die, the taste is sweet to me.
Technology has fallen backward in the field of plant anatomy.
We thought that other people needed to do the same experiment.
We wanted to see what people could make, so we imagined a lab we could ship to anywhere.
We made a lot of them.
So in the front of the medical lab comes my lab, which has 30 sensing points per plant.
If you know about genomics or genetics, that's the phenomenon, right?
The phenomenon.
When you say "I love strawberries from Mexico", you really like strawberries from the climate that produces the phrase you love.
So, if you program a climate - so from carbon dioxide and oxygen you create a recipe - you program the phrase for this plant, the food for this plant, the size of this plant, its shape, color, texture.
We need data, so we put a set of sensors there to show us what's going on.
If you were thinking about your plants, and you looked at them and you were so sad because you said to him, "Why are you dying?
Farmers have developed more eye-catching stargazing when they are in their late 60s and 70s.
They can tell you when you see the plant dying from a lack of nitrogen, a lack of calcium, or a need for more moisture.
These beautiful eyes are not inherited.
These eyes are in the virtual cloud of farmers.
We extend these data points over time.
We're connecting these data points to individual plants.
These are the brooklynar in the lab that day, through the Internet Protocol.
We have Brooklynar which has an Internet Protocol title.
If that's not weird enough, you can press one and get a personal profile of the plant,
And it teaches you about the evolution of the downloadable plant, but not as you think, it's not just when it's ready.
When will he get the food I need?
When does the taste I want come to fruition?
Is he getting too much water?
Does he get enough sun?
Warnings are warned.
He can talk to me, he speaks, we have a language.
I think this is the first user on Facebook Plants, right?
This is the information of this plant and it will begin to add friends to God.
And I mean that - it will add friends from other plants that use less nitrogen or more phosphorus, less potassium.
We will learn about the complexities of which we are still guessing some right now.
And he may not agree to our integrity - I don't know, but he may agree to our integrity request, depending on our actions.
Well, this is my lab.
It's a little better organized and my experience comes from designing data centers in hospitals for everything, so I know a little about creating a controlled environment.
So - in this environment, we conduct tests on all kinds of things,
And this process, aquaculture, was developed from the Mir space station to reduce the amount of water carried into space.
This process works on the basis of giving the plant exactly what it needs: water, minerals and oxygen.
The roots aren't that complicated, so once you give them that, you get this amazing expression.
And that means that the plant has two hearts.
And because it has two hearts, it grows four or five times faster.
It's a complete world.
We have gone far in the way of technology and the seed of a negative world and we will continue to do so, but we will also have a new tool, which is an integrated world.
Well, we've planted all sorts of things.
These tomatoes have not been commercially produced for 150 years.
Did you know that we have stores of rare and ancient seeds?
It's like a seed bank or seed bank.
The singing is amazing.
It has living origins and things you have never eaten before.
I am the only person in this room who has ever eaten this type of tomato.
The problem was that it was in the form of a tomato paste, so we ate tomato paste and it wasn't very tasty.
We've done a lot of protein-based work, we've grown all sorts of things.
We have raised even humans... well, you may be able to but we haven't.
But what we were sure of was that, the tool was too big and too expensive,
Kentar had begun distributing it around the world and it was worth about $100,000.
And finding someone with $100,000 in their back pocket is not easy, so we wanted another little job.
And this project was actually for a student - a mechanical engineer named Camille.
And Camille and I and my team have been discussing how to make it cheaper, how to make it work better, how to make it work so that others can make it.
Then we distributed it to schools between the seventh and eleventh grades.
And if you really want to humiliate yourself, try to teach a child something.
And so I went into that school and said, "Let's set it to a 65% humidity".
One seventh-grade student asked, "What is humidity?"
I said, "Yeah, it's the water in the air".
He said, "There is no water in the air, you idiot?
And I said something like, "Well, don't trust me.
In fact -- you don't trust me, do you?
Put it on 100.
If I put it on 100 what happened?
The arrow began to intensify, creating fog and then began to drop.
He said, "Oh, humidity is rain.
Why didn't you just tell me that?"
We have set up a communication so it looks a lot like the game.
They have a three-dimensional environment, which they can access from anywhere in the world on their smartphones or laptops.
They have different components of the medium - natural, sensitive.
And they choose recipes created by other boys anywhere in the world.
They pick and play the recipe and plant the seed.
And as they grow, do they make changes?
They say, for example, "Why does a plant need carbon dioxide?
Isn't Arsari bad?"
If we release the gas, the plant will die.
And if we cut down, the plant grows well.
I'm harvesting plants, and I've created a new digital recipe.
It's an interactive design and development process and exploration process.
Then they can save that, and all the data about the new plant they developed or the new digital recipe and what they did - was it better or worse?
Imagine this as a small hub of operations.
We're going to learn a lot.
And this is one of the food computers, as we call it, in a school after three weeks.
That's three weeks of growth.
But more importantly, this is the first time this boy has ever thought about becoming a farmer - or that he would like to be a farmer.
And that's why we've opened all of this up to the public.
It's online, go home and try to build your first food computer.
It's going to be hard - that's what I told you.
We're a bit of a start, but everything's there.
It is important to me that access is easy.
And we will continue to try to make it easier.
These are farmers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, botanists, economists, urban planners.
They work on a one-to-one basis, and they are good at what they do.
But we've grown a little bit more.
These are some of my facilities that I've just started working on.
The warehouse could be anywhere.
That's why I chose him.
And inside this warehouse we're going to build something like this, for example.
And now it exists.
Take a good look at it.
They actually exist, too.
One grows vegetables, and the other grows a vaccine for Ebola.
It is remarkable that these plants and the winner of the Defense Advanced Research Agency's Grand Prize are one of the reasons we have advanced on Ebola.
Plants produce protein that is resistant to Ebola.
As well as pharmacists and nutritionists, go down to the lettuce.
But these two things are not alike, and here I am shown with my field.
Everything is different.
We've reached the strange "everything is fine" state, and it's like someone saying "this is my black box" and "no, buy my box".
"No, no, no - I have very valuable intellectual property rights.
Buy my box, not his".
And the truth is that we are still at the beginning, at a time when society is moving as well.
When we order cheaper food, we are not asking for more environmentally friendly food.
And when McDonald announces what's in chicken balls, the weirdest food of all time - and they base their marketing plan on it - everything changes.
And now let's get into the world.
The private food computers, food service providers and food data centers run on an open phenomenon.
Think of an open genetic map, but we'll put in small climate recipes, like Wikipedia, that can streamline, run, and grow their pages.
What in the world is this like?
Remember that the world is connected by threads?
We started to find the lighthouses.
We started by sending information about food, instead of food.
This is not fiction, this is what we are actually publishing now.
Food computers and food servers, and soon food data centers, connect people together to share information.
The future of food is not about fighting over what's wrong with this.
We know what's wrong with that.
The future of food is about connecting the next billion farmers and strengthening them to the basis that they ask and answer the question, "What if?"
Thank you very much.
There are times when I feel really ashamed to be European.
Last year, more than a million people arrived in Europe in need of our help, and our response, frankly, was pathetic.
There are many contradictions,
We were deeply saddened by the tragic death of the two-year-old Kurdish child, and since then, more than 200 children have subsequently drowned in the Mediterranean.
We have international treaties that recognize that refugees are a shared responsibility, but we have accepted that the small Lebanon hosts more Syrians than all of Europe.
We regret the existence of human traffickers, but we have made them the only viable way to apply for asylum in Europe.
We have a shortage of jobs, but we have excluded those people whose economic and demographic needs are met when we come to Europe.
We uphold the liberal values we have in opposing the radical Islam, but - we have repressive policies that impede child asylum seekers, divide children from their families, and confiscate the property of refugees.
What should we do?
How did the situation get so bad that we adopted this inhuman policy to address this humanitarian crisis?
I don't think it's because people don't care, or at least I don't want to believe it.
But I think the reason for this is that our citizens lack a vision, a vision of how to adopt an international refugee system that was established more than 50 years ago for a changing and globalized world.
So what I want to do is take a step back and ask two fundamental questions, we all need to ask the two questions,
The first question is, why doesn't the current system work?
And secondly, what can we do to reform this system?
The modern refugee system was created after World War II by these men.
Its main objective is to ensure that when the state fails, or worse happens, that the regime turns against its people, the people find a place to go, to live in security and dignity until they can return to their homelands.
It was created specifically for situations like the situation we see in Syria today,
Through an international agreement signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and the International Commission on Human Rights, the Convention established that countries treated equally should treat people on their territory who are fleeing conflict and persecution.
But today, this system has failed.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
But in practice, our immigration policies are based on cutting the road to safety.
In theory, a refugee has the right to be integrated into society, or to be returned to the country of origin,
But in reality their fate remains indefinitely forgotten.
In theory, the refugee issue is a global shared responsibility.
But in practice, geography means that countries close to conflict take up the vast majority of the world's refugees.
This system was not broken because its rules were wrong.
We have not applied it enough in this changing world, and that is what we need to reconsider.
So I want to explain to you a little bit about how the current system works.
And how does the refugee system actually work?
But not from a top-down perspective from an institutional perspective, rather than from a refugee perspective.
So imagine a Syrian princess,
And let us call her Princess,
And a princess for me represents a lot of people I've met in the area.
Amir, who represents about 25 percent of the world's refugees, is a woman with children who cannot return home because she came from this city you see before you, Homs, a once beautiful and historic city now in ruins.
And yet, the princess cannot go there.
It also has no hope of resettling in a third country, as that is only available as a lottery ticket to less than one percent of the world's refugees.
Therefore, the princess and her family face an almost impossible choice.
They have three basic options.
The first option is that a princess can take her family to the camp,
Where you can get help, but there are very few expectations for a princess and her family.
The camps are in dark, arid places, often in the desert.
In the Zatar camp in Jordan, you can hear the sound of shells at night across the border in Syria.
There is limited economic activity.
Education is often of a poor quality.
Around the world, about 80 percent of refugees living in camps must stay there for at least five years.
It's a miserable life, and perhaps that's why, in fact, only nine percent of Syrians have taken this option.
Instead, the princess can travel to urban areas to neighboring cities, such as Oman or Beirut.
This option was taken by about 75 percent of Syrian refugees.
But there is, too, great difficulty,
Refugees in these urban areas often do not have the right to work,
They usually do not have access to assistance,
So when a princess and her family used their basic savings, they were likely to face poverty in urban areas.
So there is a third alternative to them, which is why we have increased our refugee numbers.
Where a Princess Tamsaar could offer some hope for her family by risking their lives on a perilous journey to another country, as we see in Europe today.
Around the world, we face refugees who often have no choice but to camp, or live in poverty in the surrounding urban areas, or travel a dangerous journey.
For refugees, this option is now part of the global refugee system.
But I think it's a wrong choice.
And that we can reconsider that choice.
The reason for the reduction of these options is that we believe that these are the only options available to refugees, and there are no other options.
Politicians have framed the case as a zero-sum case, so that if we take advantage of refugees, we will impose costs on citizens.
We tend to assume collectively that refugees are also an inevitable cost or burden to society.
But this is not necessarily the case and they can contribute to the community,
And what I would like to suggest is that we can expand those options so that everyone benefits from them: the host countries and communities, our communities and the refugees themselves.
So I would like to suggest four ways in which we can change the way we think about the refugee issue.
All four approaches have a common thread: they are the same approaches that have led us to globalization, mobility and markets, and modernise the way we think about the refugee issue.
The first way I would like to think about it is the idea of enabling environments, which starts with a basic recognition that refugees are human beings just like anyone else, but only in exceptional circumstances.
Together with my colleagues at Oxford, I embarked on a research project in Uganda on the economic life of refugees.
We chose Uganda not because it represents all host countries.
Not because they are, but because they are exceptional.
Unlike most host countries around the world, Uganda has done a lot to provide economic opportunities for refugees.
I gave them the right to work and freedom of movement,
The consequences of this are unusual for both refugees and host communities.
In Kampala, the capital, we found that 21 percent of refugees own businesses that employ other people, and 40 percent of those employees are nationals of the host country.
In other words, refugees create jobs for citizens of the host country.
Even in the camps, we found exceptional examples of thriving and vibrant nuclear companies,
For example, in the Nakhival settlement of Nakhar, we found examples of Congolese refugees running digital music companies.
Our grandfather, Rwandan, runs a business that allows young people to play computer games from televisions and recycled games,
Unlike restrictions imposed elsewhere, refugees are innovators, and the man you see in front of you is a Congolese named Dimo-kai.
Dimo-kaiar arrived at this settlement with very little, but he wanted to be an outlet.
So he started with a local radio station, with a group of friends and colleagues, rented a video camera, and is now a filmmaker,
He has presented two documentaries with our team, and has successfully established a commercial venture with very little.
It is these kinds of examples that should focus our response to refugees.
Instead of seeing refugees as inevitably dependent on humanitarian aid, we need to provide opportunities for them to pursue human prosperity.
Yes, clothing, underwear, shelter, and food are all important in an emergency, but we also need to look beyond that.
We need to provide opportunities for connectivity and electricity, education, the right to work, access to capital and banking.
All the ways we take to reach the global economy can and should apply to refugees.
The second idea I want to talk about is economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all host countries in the world have followed the same paths as Uganda,
Most host countries do not open their economies to refugees in the same way.
But there are still alternate reality options we can use.
Last April, I traveled to Jordan with a colleague, accompanied by economic development officer Paul Collier, and I came up with an idea while we were there with the international community and the government, an idea to provide jobs for Syrians by supporting the Jordanian National Development Strategy.
The idea is for an economic zone, through which we can strongly integrate refugees into the workforce along with the employment of Jordanian host nationals.
And just 15 minutes from the Zaatari camp, there is a home to 83,000 refugees, the current economic zone called King Hussein bin Talal's Development Initiative.
The government has spent more than a hundred million dollars to get it to the grid and roads, but it lacks two things: access to work and domestic investment.
What if the refugees were able to work there and instead of being stuck in camps, they would be able to support their families and develop skills through vocational training before returning to Syria?
We recognize that Jordan can benefit from this, which requires its development strategy to make a rapid transition from a middle-income country to an industrialized one,
It can benefit refugees, but it can also contribute to the reconstruction of Syria after the end of the conflict by recognizing that we need to embrace refugees as the ultimate source of Syria's reconstruction.
We published the idea in the journal Foreign Affairs.
King Abdullah had this idea,
It was announced in London at the Syria conference two weeks ago, and will go into effect next summer.
The third idea I want to put in your hands is the homogeneous preference between states and refugees for happy outcomes, as you can see here in the personal photos of Angela Merkel and Syrian refugees.
What we rarely do is ask refugees what they want, and where they want to go, but what I care about is that we can do that and make everyone better.
Economist Alvin Roth proposed the idea of homogeneous markets in such a way that the arrangement of preferences between the parties would form a final homogeneity.
Colleagues Will Jones and Alex Tittelboim have devised ways to apply this idea to refugees by asking refugees about their favorite places but it also allows countries to classify the types of refugees they want to host based on skill or language standards and allowing them to engage.
Now, of course you need to build up equities like diversity and vulnerability, but they are the means to increase the potential for mergers.
The idea of merging has been successfully used, for example, to engage students in universities, to engage kidney donors with patients, and to underpin the algorithms found on dating sites.
So why not apply the idea of giving refugees more options?
It can also be used at the national level, as one of the major challenges facing us is to convince local communities to accept refugees,
And right now, in my country, for example, we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to cities, which makes no sense at all.
So the unification of markets provides a possible way to achieve these preferences together and to listen to the needs and demands of the working population and the refugees themselves.
The fourth idea I want to put into your hands is humanitarian visas.
Much of the tragedy and chaos we saw in Europe could have been completely avoided,
It stems from the fundamental contradiction in the European asylum policy, which is as follows: in order to obtain asylum in Europe, you must come spontaneously through those risky journeys that I have described.
But why should such dangerous flights be necessary when we are in the age of economic aviation and the capabilities of modern embassies?
These are absolutely unnecessary travel and led to the deaths of more than 3,000 people last year on the borders of Europe and within the European continent.
If refugees are simply allowed to travel directly and apply for asylum in Europe, we will avoid this, and there is a way to do so through something called a humanitarian visa, which allows people to obtain a visa at the embassy or consulate of a neighboring country where they simply pay for their trip by ship or air to Europe.
About a thousand thousand euros is the cost of smuggling refugees from Turkey to the Greek islands.
While it costs 200 euros to travel by economic flight from Bodrum to Frankfurt.
If we allow refugees to do this, it would have great positive consequences.
It will save lives, completely cut off the smuggling market and remove the chaos we see on the European frontline in areas such as the Greek islands.
It is a policy that prohibits doing so rather than a rational solution,
And this idea was applied,
Brazil has adopted a pioneering approach, with more than 2,000 Syrians having been able to obtain humanitarian visas, and when they enter Brazil receiving a refugee visa.
Every Syrian in this project enjoys refugee status and has been recognized as a real refugee.
There is another historical precedent as well,
Between 1922 and 1942, these ambassadorial passports were used as travel documents to allow the transfer of 45,000 Armenians, Chechens and Turks to travel through Europe and to obtain a refugee visa elsewhere in Europe.
The International Refugee Agency and the International Refugee Agency were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for this viable strategy.
So all four ideas I've presented to you are a way through which we can expand the range of options for a princess,
They are ways in which we can get great options for refugees, far from the three basic impossible options I have explained to you so that you leave others better off.
In conclusion, we really need a new vision, a vision of expanding the options for refugees but realizing that they should not be a burden.
There is nothing inevitable about the cost of refugees.
Yes, it is a matter of humanity and responsibility, but they are human beings with skills, talents and ambitions, and have the potential to contribute... if we allow them to.
In the new world, immigration is not on its way to extinction.
What we have seen in Europe will be present with us for many years to come.
People will continue to travel, and will continue to be displaced, so we need to find a realistic and rational way to manage this... not based on the old logic of humanitarian aid, nor on the logic of charity, but based on building the opportunities offered by mobility and globalized markets,
I assure you that we must wake up from our neglect and urge politicians to wake up to this challenge.
Thank you very much.
When I was a little kid, I always dreamed of the ocean.
It was once that wild place full of color and life, home to those imaginary strange creatures.
I've photographed the great sharks that dominate the food chain and have seen the agile sea turtles dance around the coral reefs.
As a marine biologist, I became a photographer, and spent most of my career searching for magical places like the ones I dreamed of as a child.
As you can see, I started to explore sea levels at a relatively early age.
But the first time I ever dived deep underwater, I was ten years old.
I still remember well when I swam wildly to reach that old cannon with its shallow coral reefs.
When I finally got to it, I looked up, and fish were all around me in all the colors of the rainbow.
It was the day I fell in love with the ocean.
Thomas Bishak, a conservation photographer for forty years on this planet, gave me the opportunity to explore some of the stunning sea views for National Geographic magazine and the Ahmadu Saharna Foundation.
I've photographed everything from the big sharks to the small ones that fit my hand's comfort.
I've absorbed the suspicious smell of hyaena whales feeding within a foot of me in the cold Canadian sea along the rainforest of the giant bear".
I was familiar with the mating rituals of the sea green turtles in the Strait of Mozambique.
Every person on this planet is affected by and influenced by the ocean.
The beautiful, clean seas I dreamed of as a child have become very hard to find.
The seas have become more pressured and threatened.
We as humans still maintain our role as the invaders on Earth, and we have witnessed and experienced many of these direct effects.
For a long time, I thought I'd shock Republicans with their indifference with some annoying images.
And although this approach has its advantages, I've returned to the beginning.
I believe that the best way to change is to sell love.
I think I play the role of a kind of "speaker" and as a photographer, I have a rare opportunity to discover the animals and ecosystems that lie beneath the ocean surface.
You can't fall in love with something and become a hero if you don't know it exists.
By revealing this--this is the photographic power of the province.
I have visited hundreds of marine sites, but only a few maritime scenes have caught my attention and had a profound impact.
The first time I experienced this elevation was about 10 years ago, off the rough and wild coast of South Africa.
In June and July, huge swarms of Sardinians travel north in a mass migration called "Sardin Escape".
And those fish have a good reason to run away.
Where it is hunted by predators and predators.
Dolphins are hunted in a common way and you can separate a herd from sardines to create small, enticing groups of fish.
The fish are dragged to the surface and then rush to dinner to celebrate.
It is believed that sharks are behind this.
Now, most people think that both sharks and dolphins are mortal enemies, but during the "sword escape", they actually coexist.
In fact, dolphins help sharks to feed effectively.
Without the help of dolphins, food balls are more widespread and sharks often end up eating what are called sardine-filled snails, or a mouthful of water.
Now, after experiencing exciting moments with sharks during the "Surdine Escape", she knew she didn't see me as a victim.
However, I am slapped like any other guest during this very noisy party.
From the shores of Africa, let's travel east, where the vast Indian Ocean extends to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral islands.
During the stormy southwestern monsoon season, sea devil fish travel across the archipelago to a small spot in Ba Atoll called Haberro.
Large collections of shellfish, no larger than the size of the eyelid, are the staple food of the sea devil fish.
When the amount of algae becomes small, the sea devil fish feed on its own and wander around many times, like a puppy chasing its tail.
Whereas, when the amount of algae grows, the sea devil fish line up one after the other to form a long food chain and if the first fish cannot eat food, it will of course be taken over by the pro-fish.
The lower the algae in the bay, the closer the sea devil fishes get to each other, a unique behavior called hurricane feeding.
Because they move in a narrow shape, this group of sea devil fish creates a type of hurricane, absorbing the algae and bringing them to their mouths.
The experience of diving among hundreds of sea devils is truly a unique and memorable experience.
When Hanívarar was first photographed, this area was not protected and was threatened by development.
Working with NGOs such as the Manta Trust, Furi has helped to make the Hannivaru protected area a must.
Recently, fishermen from neighboring islands once hunted sea devils to make traditional drums from the skin of these fishes.
Today, they are among the most enthusiastic conservatives and the Maldivian economy is gaining more than $8 million annually from sea devil fish.
I've always wanted to go back in time to an era when maps were mostly empty or read, "There's a dragon".
Today, the closest place he has ever visited is the remote islands in the western Indian Ocean.
Far from the sea lanes and fishing fleets, diving in these waters is a moving reminder of how our oceans once were.
Few people have heard of Basas da Indias, a small coral reef in the Mozambique Channel.
The Hear is a coral reef that represents a protective outer barrier and the inner lake is a nesting site for the Galapagos shark.
Sharks were shy even during the day.
I had a feeling that they would be bolder and more numerous at night.
I've never encountered so many sharks on coral reefs.
Photographing moments like this and sharing them with everyone - reminds me why I chose this path.
Sometime during this year, I was on a mission for National Geographic magazine in Baja California.
About halfway down the peninsula on the Pacific side of the peninsula is San Ignacio Lagoon, the birthplace of the gray whale.
For 100 years, this coast has witnessed a massacre, killing more than 20,000 gray whales, leaving only a few hundred survivors.
Today, the grandchildren of the same whales push their young to the surface to play and even interact with us.
I have witnessed a truly remarkable comeback of these species.
Now, on the other side of the peninsula is Cabo Plumo, a quiet fishing island.
The decades of poaching have brought about a collapse.
In 1995, local fishermen persuaded the authorities to declare their waters a marine reserve.
But what happened next was nothing short of a miracle.
In 2005, after only a decade of protection, scientists measured the extent of fish recovery.
But don't listen to a word of mine- come with me.
With just one fish, they dived with me into the depths, one of the greatest fish spaces I've ever encountered.
We all have the ability to create some kind of hope.
And through my photography, I want to spread a message: It's not too late to protect our oceans.
And I want to focus especially on, flexibility and ease of adaptation to nature for the 7.3 billion people.
I hope that in the future, I will look more and more to make images like this, and create images that show our respectful coexistence with the ocean.
I hope it becomes a daily event for me.
To thrive and survive in my career, you really have to be hopelessly optimistic.
And you always work on the assumption that the beautiful image that will change is only too close, behind the next coral, inside the next lake or maybe in the lake that follows it.
When Harar moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was the basis of Zimbabwe's national health policy.
The new government emerged after a long war for independence and immediately declared a socialist program: healthcare and primary education were essentially free.
There has been a huge spread of rural health centres where nearly 80% of the population can access these services in less than two hours on foot, a huge achievement of its kind.
In 1980, the year of independence, about 25% of Zimbabwe's children were vaccinated.
By 1990, after only a decade, this number had risen to 80%.
I felt very proud to be a part of this transformation, this revolution.
That sense of excitement and friendship was obvious.
Working alongside the smartest Zimbabweans - scientists, doctors and activists - I felt a sense of belonging not only to the African independence movement, but also to the advancing public health movement.
But there were enormous challenges.
Zimbabwe declared its first case of AIDS in 1985, the year it filed.
I took care of a number of AIDS patients in the early 1980s, when I was a medical intern at Harlem Hospital, but - we had no idea what was in the African repository.
The incidence rate increased by about 2% during the first few days I was there.
This can increase for one in four adults 17 years after Harare left.
By the mid-1990s, I had learned about hundreds of people in a very young year who had been infected with HIV.
I have seen many colleagues and friends die, students and patients in hospitals die.
In response to these situations, I set up a hospital with my colleagues.
We have done a lot of interventions to explain the use of condoms.
We have also made interventions in the education and workplace.
We did some research and gave instructions to the partners of men with disabilities on how to protect themselves.
We worked hard and at the time I thought I was doing my best.
Kantar offers excellent treatment, as it should be.
But I wasn't talking about structural change.
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan spoke about his personal failure which led to the genocide in Rwanda.
In 1994, he was the head of the UN peacekeeping mission.
On the 10th anniversary of the genocide, he stated, "I thought I was doing my best, but I realized after the genocide that there were many things that could have been done or should have been done to clarify the danger arc and join forces to provide support".
The AIDS epidemic has killed a society that was not prepared, and today the World Health Organization estimates that nearly 39 million people have died from the disease, not only is it overwhelmingly sad and regrettable that I did not do more things earlier.
But while I was living in Zimbabwe, I didn't see myself as a supporter or a politician.
I was there to improve my technical skills, and my skills related to my research on epidemics.
In my mind, my career was in patient care and research to better understand the patterns of transmission of infection among populations, and I hoped to slow the spread of the virus.
I was aware that the socially marginalized classes of the population were most at risk of contracting AIDS and dying.
For sugarcane farming, which is more similar to the fecundity-based system than any modern institution, 60 percent of pregnant women have been infected with HIV.
I have made it clear that the injury is not about moral decay but about the culture of male superiority, forced migrant labor and colonialism.
As health professionals, our tools were very limited: we urged people to change their individual behaviors, use condoms, and limit the number of partners.
Infection rates increased, and when treatment became available in the West, the treatment that remains our strongest weapon against the virus, was not available to the public sector in Africa.
I did not mention the inequality in access to these lifesaving drugs or the economic and political systems implied which were the cause of the infection rates among many populations.
I justified Scotty by reminding myself that I am no more than a guest in this country, and that the sound of the danger signal could cause me to be fired, preventing me from doing good work, caring for patients, and doing the research I most need.
So I didn't talk about the early government's position on AIDS.
I didn't express my concerns loud enough.
Some doctors and health professionals will think that I did nothing wrong.
Our agreement with our patients, the division of Hippocrates and his derivatives, is centered around the sanctity of the relationship between the doctor and the patient.
And I did my best to each patient of my patients.
But I knew that epidemics manifested themselves through the divisions in our society, which not only reflected biology, but more importantly, patterns of marginalization, exclusion, discrimination based on race, gender, social class and other factors.
This is true for AIDS.
And this was true in the case of Ebola recently.
Medical anthropologists such as Paul Farmer, who studied AIDS in Haiti, call this structural violence: structural because abuses are inherent in the organization at the economic and political level of our social world, often in ways invisible to those with privileges and power, and since violence is a reflection - cases of premature death, suffering and illness - it is a form of violence.
We do little for our patients if we fail to regulate these cases of social inequality.
The risk-reliever draft is the first step in the spread of the right to public health, a way to combine support efforts to get out of this situation and achieve some kind of change together.
So these days, I'm not going to be quiet anymore.
I will talk about many things, even if the audience doesn't feel comfortable, even if I don't feel comfortable either.
Much of my talk will be about racial and ethnic disparities in institutions, things that are not supposed to exist in this country, certainly not in the medical field or public health.
But they do exist, and we pay them to kill our lives before they are.
That is why the alarm should be rung on the health effects of racism in the United States, the ongoing violence among individuals and within organizations and people of color, the duplication of our tragic legacy from 250 years of slavery, 90 years of enforcement of Jim Crow laws and 60 years of unstable equality, the alarm should be rung on this fundamental and central issue to properly carry out my work as New York City Health Commissioner.
In New York City, the early death rate -- that is, death before age 65 -- is 50% higher for black people than for white people.
In 2012, a black woman faced a 10 times higher risk of dying at birth than a white woman.
Although we have made enormous strides in reducing infant mortality, black infants face almost three times the risk of dying in their first year compared to white infants.
And New York City is no exception.
These statistics are compared to other statistics across the United States.
A recent analysis by The New York Times has shown that 1.5 million black people are also missing.
They pointed out that more than one in six black men, believed to be between the ages of 25 and 45, have been missing, have disappeared from daily life, have been jailed or died prematurely.
This is a major form of inequality in the daily and inappropriate acts of violence that black youth face, and recent protests have centered around the slogan #life_black_importance.
But we must remember that the constant and disparate ratios and consequences of common medical conditions - heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and AIDS - are diseases that can slowly and quietly lead to death and may take many black lives prematurely.
As the #blacklife movement spread, I was frustrated and angry that the medical community had objected to using the word "racism" in our research and studies.
You probably felt something every time I said that word.
Our medical students protested the "day-ins" method in their white blouses, but the medical community supported it negatively as discrimination still affects the level of disease among people and deaths.
I am concerned about the trend towards precise and personalized medicine, in search of biological or genetic goals for better treatments, which may cause us to inadvertently ignore the overall picture of the subject, namely the daily context, where a person lives and grows up and is loved and, most importantly, the health of the population, and for many of us, "poor health".
As health professionals, in our daily work, whether in hospital or when doing research, we witness a state of great inequality: a homeless person who is unable to follow medical advice because he has other priorities, young transgender people who are contemplating suicide because our society is so cruel, single mothers who must feel responsible for their son's poor health.
Our role as health professionals is not only to treat our patients, but also to sound the alarm and call for change.
Whether that's true or not, our social network gives our voices a lot of credibility, and we shouldn't overdo it.
I am not speaking out in Zimbabwe, and I have made a vow to myself that as New York City's health commissioner, I will use every opportunity to sound the alarm and join forces to promote health equity.
I will speak out against racism and I hope you will join me, and I will join you when you speak about discrimination on the basis of sex or any other form of equality.
It's time for us all to stand up and speak out about structural inequality.
We don't have to have all the answers to call for change.
We just need courage.
The health of our patients, and the health of us all, depends on it.
Well, how many of you have ever cancelled someone's Facebook friendship because they said something annoying about politics or religion, child protection, or food?
And how many of you try to ignore at least one person because you simply don't want to talk to them?
You know, we should have just followed Henry Higgins' advice in "My Fair Lady": stick to talking about weather and health.
But these days, with climate change and vaccines being fought, those topics -- they're not safe either.
Therefore, this world in which we live, this world in which every conversation has the potential to turn into a dispute, where politicians cannot talk to each other and where even at the very end of issues you find someone fighting for or against them emotionally, is unnatural.
BioResearch conducted a study of 10,000 American adults, and found that at this moment, we are more polarized, more divided, than ever before in history.
It is unlikely that we will reach a compromise, which means that we are not listening to each other,
We make decisions about where we live, who we marry, and even who our friends will be, depending on what we already believe.
Again, this means that we don't listen to each other.
Conversation requires a balance between speaking and listening, and somewhere along the way, this conversation loses that balance.
Now, part of that goes back to technology.
Smartphones that are either in your hands or close enough to be quickly accessible.
According to a study by BioResearch, about a third of Americans send more than 100 emails a day.
And many of them, almost all of them, are more likely to exchange messages with their friends than to watch them face to face.
There is an excellent article in the Atlantic.
It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnoel.
He gave his children a contact project.
He said he wanted to teach them how to talk about a particular topic without using notes.
He said this "I have realized"...
Arar realized that conversational skills may be one of the most difficult skills we've ever failed to teach.
Children spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens, but rarely have the opportunity to hone personal communication skills.
This question may seem ridiculous, but we should ask ourselves: Is there any skill in the 21st century more important than being able to maintain a cohesive and confident conversation?"
Now, I speak directly to people: including Nobel laureates, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, and plumbers.
I talk to people I love, I talk to people I don't like, I talk to people I don't like, I talk to people I don't like, I talk to people I don't like, I talk to people I don't like, I talk to people I don't like, I talk to people I don't like, I talk to people I don't like, I talk to people I don't like, I talk to people I don't like, I talk to people I don't like, I talk to people I don't like, I talk to people I don't like, I talk to people I don't like, I talk to people I don't like, I talk to people I don't like, I talk to people I don't like, I talk to people I don't like, I don't know what I don't like
I'm talking to some people I have deeply disagreed with on a personal level.
But I still have a great conversation with them.
So I would like to make fun of the next 10 minutes to teach you how to talk and how to listen.
Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this, things like looking at the person's eye while speaking, thinking ahead of time about interesting topics to discuss, looking and shaking your head and smiling to show that you are ready to talk, repeating what you just heard or summarizing it up.
I want you to forget all that.
Because that's stupid!
There is no reason to teach you how to pay attention if you are actually paying attention.
Now, I'm actually using the same skills in professional interviews that I do in everyday life.
So, I'm going to teach you how to meet people, and this will actually help you learn how to become better communicators.
Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time and without getting tired, for God's sake, without offending anyone.
We've all had important conversations before.
We've done it before, and we know what it looked like.
The kind of conversation you play with and feel inspired by, or that you feel you have been deeply connected or that you have been perfectly understood.
There is no reason why most of your relationships shouldn't be like their predecessors.
So I have 10 basic rules I'm going to explain to you, but honestly, if you choose just one and follow it, you'll have a great conversation.
Number one: Do not perform multiple tasks.
And I don't mean to suggest that you leave your cell phone, tablet, car keys or anything else in your hands.
But what I mean is, I can't be mindful.
Ten minutes into the moment.
Don't think about the argument that has been going on between you and your boss at work.
Don't think about what you're going to eat for dinner.
If you want to get out of the conversation, get out of the conversation, but don't be half in and half out!
Secondly, don't hold on to your opinion.
If you would like to express your opinion without giving any opportunity to respond or discuss, or to increase and develop your idea, write a blog.
Now, there's a really good reason why I don't let the critics be on my show: because they're really boring.
If they were conservative, you'd find them hating Obama and the food stamps and abortion.
If they were liberals, they would hate big banks, oil companies and Dick Cheney.
We can predict this perfectly.
And you don't want to be that way.
You need to enter every conversation as if you have something you want to learn.
As noted therapist Scott Beck said, it requires proper listening by putting oneself aside.
This sometimes means that you can't take your personal opinion.
He said that if we feel this acceptance, the speaker will be less likely and more likely to open up what is in his or her head and inside his or her mind to the listener.
Again, let's say you want to know something.
As Bill Nye said, "Everyone you meet knows something you don't".
And I listened to it like this: Everyone knows something.
Thirdly, use open-ended questions.
In this case, the reference is journalists.
Start your questions with what, when, where, why or how.
If you ask a complicated question, you will get an easy answer.
"Were you frightened?" asked Flo.
Then you'll answer the strongest word in the sentence, "terrible", and the answer will be "yes, I was" or "no, I wasn't".
"Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry".
Let them describe it, understand who they know.
Try asking them questions like "How was that?"
"and how did that feel"?
Because after that they may have to pause for a moment and think about it, and you will get more enjoyable answers.
Fourth: Walk with the current.
This means that ideas will come to your mind and you need to get those ideas out of your mind.
I've often heard interviews where guests talk for several minutes and then the host comes back and asks a question that seems to come from nowhere or has already been answered,
This means that the host stopped listening for two minutes because he thought about this brilliant question, and was determined to say so.
We do the same thing.
We were sitting with someone we were talking to, and suddenly we remembered that day when we met Hog Jackman in the cafe.
And we stop listening.
Stories and ideas will come to mind,
And you need to let these ideas come and go.
Fifthly: If you don't know, say you don't know.
People on the radio, especially on stations like NPR, are much more aware that they are recording, so you find them more cautious about things they claim to be experts in and things they claim to be confident in.
Do this carefully.
Speaking shouldn't be cheap.
Simply put: Don't compare your experience with theirs.
If they talk about losing a family member, don't talk about the time someone in your family has lost.
If they talk about some of the problems they face at work, don't tell them how much you hate your job.
The subject is not the same, nor will it be.
Every experience can be taken to one side.
And most importantly, it's not about you.
You don't need to talk and try to show how amazing you are or how much you have suffered in the past.
Someone once asked Stephen Hawking about his IQ, and he said, "I have no idea. because people who brag about their IQ are the ones who fail".
Mar conversations are not a promotional opportunity.
Seventh: Don't try to reinvent yourself.
Because in that kind of self-pity and boredom, we do it a lot.
Especially in business conversations or conversations with our children, we want to get to a certain meaning, so we just rephrase the word over and over again.
Don't do that.
Eighth: Stay away from weeds.
What I mean by that is that people don't care about the years, the names, the dates, and all the details that people suffer to remember.
They don't care about that, and they care about you.
They care about what you like, and what you have in common.
So, forget these details and leave it alone.
Nine: And this is not the last point, but the most important point.
Listen to me now.
I may not be able to tell you how many people have told you that listening can be the most important skill they can develop.
The Buddha said, "I am here to give you his words, if you open your mouth, you will not learn".
"No one has lost their job because of their overhearing", said Calvin College.
So why don't we hear each other sing?
First of all, we prefer to talk.
When I speak, I am in control.
And you don't need to hear anything you're not interested in.
And then I'm the center of attention.
And I can reinforce my identity.
But there is another reason: our attention is distracted.
The average person speaks about 225 words per minute, but we can hear 500 words per minute.
So our minds are busy and full of 275 words like that.
I also know that it takes energy and effort to get your attention to someone, and if you can't do that, you don't actually talk.
You are two people who are barely speaking and screaming in the same place.
So we must listen to each other.
Stephen Covey said it beautifully.
He said: "Most of us don't listen with the intention of understanding.
But he listens only with the intention of answering. "
Another rule is rule ten, which is the abbreviation of speech.
[A good conversation is like a short owl: it's short enough to get attention, and long enough to get the attention of the audience] All of this is summed up in the same basic concept, which is: be interested in others.
You know, I grew up with a very popular grandfather, and there were certain rituals in my house.
People used to come to talk to my grandparents, and after they left, my mother would come up to us and say, "Do you know who that was?"
She was once the queen of America's beauty pageant.
Andar was the mayor of Sacramento.
She's a Pulitzer Prize winner, and a famous Russian ballet dancer".
So I grew up with the assumption that everyone has something special hidden from them.
And frankly, I think that's what makes me the best host.
And that I try my best to keep my mouth shut, my mind open, and I'm always willing to be amazing, and I've never been disappointed.
And you should do the same.
Go out and talk to people, listen to them, and most importantly, be prepared to be surprised.
Thank you, Thank you.
Hello, you are here.
My name is Matthew Williams, I am a hero.
I have won medals in three different sports and at the Canadian National Games, played internationally in basketball and I am proud to have represented Canada internationally.
I train five days a week on basketball and speed skating, working with top-level coaches and mental performance consultants to be at my best in my sport.
All this, by the way, during the Special Olympics.
Does that change your view of me and my accomplishments?
The world does not consider such people heroes.
Not so long ago, my examples were outcasts and hiding out of sight.
A lot has changed since the Special Olympics began in 1968, but in many cases, people with mental disabilities are considered invisible to others everywhere.
People often use abusive words in front of me, and they think it doesn't matter.
He uses the word "late" or "late" in a derogatory way.
They don't care about how much pain I feel and how much pain my friends feel.
I don't want you to think that I'm here because I represent a human cause.
I am here because there is still a big problem with the way people with mental disabilities are treated, or, more often than not, how they are not taken seriously at all.
Did you know that the World Games were organized this year?
Kentar was one of more than 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries who competed in Los Angeles.
More than 62,000 spectators attended the opening ceremony, and there was live coverage by TSN and ISBN.
Do you know what happened?
What comes to mind when you see someone like me?
I am here today to challenge you to look at us equally.
The Special Olympics have changed the identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the perceptions of their fans.
For those who are not familiar with the sport, Special Olympics are geared towards athletes with intellectual disabilities.
The Special Olympics are separate from the Paralympics and the Olympics.
We offer high-quality mobile sports software for people with mental disabilities that can make changes to their lives and minds.
This activity has changed my life and the lives of many.
It has changed the way the world views those with mental disabilities.
I was born with epilepsy and a mental disability.
As I got older, I played hockey until the age of 12,
The older I got, the harder it felt to communicate with everyone, the more angry and frustrated I was.
I hadn't played any sport for a while, didn't have many friends, and felt abandoned and overwhelmed with grief.
There was a period when people with mental disabilities were hidden away from the public eye.
It never occurred to them that they could participate in sports, let alone be a valued member of society.
In 1960, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of regular exercise on the physical fitness of children with mental disabilities.
Through careful scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers came to the conclusion that not providing an opportunity to participate causes physical fitness problems.
Many question the extent to which people with mental disabilities benefit from fitness programs and the opportunities behind sports competitions.
But pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Dr. Kennedy Shriver, founder of the Special Olympics, have been upbeat and vigilant, and have proven the Special Olympics players right more than four and a half million times.
Before I went to the Special Olympics, I was nervous, because I was young, shy, and insecure, and I didn't have many friends.
When you got there, everyone was encouraging you, working to support you and leaving room for you to be your nature without making any prior judgments.
I am now a basketball player and a figure skater who has competed in several regional and national events, and this year I was able to attend the World Summer Games in Los Angeles, where I was the first Canadian to join the basketball team and compete at the World Games.
I am one of more than four and a half million athletes from around the world, and I have heard many similar stories.
Being an athlete at the Special Olympics is a way for us to regain our self-esteem and dignity.
Special Olympics address critical health needs.
Studies have shown that, on average, men with mental disabilities die 13 years younger than normal men, and that women with mental disabilities die 20 years younger than those without a disability.
The Special Olympics work to keep us healthy, vibrant and engaged in sports.
The trainers taught us about nutrition and health.
Special Olympics also provides free health screening for athletes who have difficulty contacting a physician or accessing health care.
At the 2015 Summer Olympics, I played with members of my Canadian team against the Nigerian basketball team.
On the day before the game, the Nigerian basketball team underwent a special health check-up of the World Games athletes, where 7 out of 10 players received free headphones and were able to hear clearly for the first time.
The change they experienced was amazing.
They were more enthusiastic, happy and confident, because their coach was able to communicate with them through words.
And their emotional outbursts because they could hear the sound of basketball, the whistle, and the fans on the pitches - that sounds like a Muslim thing.
The Special Olympics are not restricted to athletes only.
You also change their lives off the pitch.
This year, research has shown that nearly half of U.S. adults do not even know if someone has a mental disability, and that 44 percent of Americans who have no personal contact with a person with mental disabilities are less accepting of each other and less positive.
Then there are those hurtful, insulting words that prove that people with mental disabilities are still invisible to many people.
People use it as if it were just passing words or a way of insulting.
I mentioned it in tweets more than nine million times last year, and it was very painful for me and for the four and a half million athletes around the world.
Many people don't consider it offensive, but it is.
As my fellow athlete and world ambassador John Franklin Stevens wrote in an open letter to political critics who used it as a derogatory term, "Join us one day at the Special Olympics.
Let's see if you're going to leave and nothing has changed inside you".
This year, at the 2015 Summer Olympics, people lined up for hours to attend the finals of weightlifting.
It was only when my colleague Jackie Barrett, the giant from Newfoundland, lifted 655 pounds and lifted 611 pounds in the squash position that he stopped everyone, setting a new record at the Special Olympics.
Jackie is the record holder among all Newfoundland athletes - not only at the Special Olympics, but in weightlifting as a whole.
Jackie was a bright star in Los Angeles, and was impressed with her performance.
Fifty years ago, few people believed that people with mental disabilities could do anything like that.
This year, 60,000 spectators gathered at the famous Los Angeles Memorial to watch the opening ceremony of the World Games and to encourage athletes from 165 countries around the world.
Far from hiding from the spotlight, we were encouraged and celebrated.
Special Olympics teach athletes confidence and self-esteem.
The Special Olympics taught the world that people with disabilities deserve respect and restraint.
I now have my dreams and aspirations in this sport, good coaches, respect and dignity, good health, and a career as a personal trainer.
I'm no longer one of those people who hide and get bullied, and here I am with the oldest TED talk ever.
The world has become a different place thanks to the Special Olympics, but there is still a long way to go.
So the next time you meet someone with a mental disability, I hope you can see their abilities.
The next time someone next to you uses those slurs, please tell them about the pain you've left behind.
Please consider participating in the Special Olympics.
I would like to conclude my discussion with one last thought.
As Nelson Mandela put it, "Sport has the potential to make a difference in the world".
Special Olympics is working to change the world by making changes to four and a half million athletes and making room for us to be confident, to know friends, not to make prejudgments, to feel that sense and be champions.
Thank you very much.
You may not have heard of Kinnama, Sierra Leone or Urua, Nigeria before.
But I know they are the most unusual places on earth.
In hospitals there, there is a community of nurses, doctors and scientists who are quietly fighting one of the deadliest threats to humanity for years: the Lhasa virus.
The Lassa virus is very similar to Ebola.
A fever can be severe and often fatal.
But these people, who risk their lives every day to protect the people in their communities, thereby protecting us all.
But one of the most unusual things I learned about them during one of my first visits there several years ago was that they started every morning - these challenges, unusual days in the front lines - with singing.
They gather together, and show their joy.
They are showing their souls.
And across the Sunnis, year after year when I visit and visit them, I meet with them, sing, write and love this, because it reminds us that we are not here to pursue science together, we are connected by our shared humanity.
And this certainly, as you can imagine, has become very important, even essential, as a starting point for change.
This changed dramatically in March 2014, when an Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea.
This is the first outbreak in West Africa, next to the borders of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
And that was scary, scary for all of us.
We actually suspected them for some time, that Lassa and Ebola were spreading more than expected, and we said that it was possible that one day he would come to Kinema.
So some of the members of my team immediately left and joined Dr. Humar Khan and his team there, and we prepared a diagnosis so that we could get partial allergy tests to catch Ebola if it came across the border and into Sierra Leone.
We already had these tests for the virus of Lhasa prepared, we knew how to do this, the team was great.
We should have just given them the tools and space to explore Ebola.
And unfortunately, that day came.
On 23 May 2014, a woman was admitted to the hospital's maternity ward, and the team performed these important molecular tests and identified the first confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
This was an extraordinary work that had been done.
They were able to diagnose the condition immediately, treat the patient safely and initiate follow-up to find out what was happening.
I almost stopped something.
But with that day in hand, the epidemic had been raging for months?
In hundreds of cases, it has already outstripped all previous epidemics.
And I came to Sierra Leone not as an individual case, but as a big wave.
We should have worked with the global community, with the Ministry of Health, with Kinema. To begin with, we had to deal with those cases, where the next week it brought 31, then 92, then 147 cases - all coming to Kinema, one of the only places in Sierra Leone capable of dealing with this.
And we worked around the clock trying to do our best to help these people, trying to get attention, but we also did something else simple.
From that sample we took from the patient's blood to detect Ebola, we can extract it, clearly.
The other thing we can do, in fact, is chemically stop it, put it in a box and then send it across the ocean, and that's what we did.
We sent him to Boston, where my team works.
We worked around the clock, dividing our work into shifts, day after day, and quickly produced 99 Ebola virus genomes.
This is the diagram - the viral genome is the diagram.
We all have one.
It says everything inside us, and it says too much information.
The result of such an action is simple and powerful.
We can actually take these 99 different viruses, observe them and compare them, and we can see, in fact, compared to three genes that have happened before and spread from Guinea, we can see the beginning of the outbreak in Guinea months ago, once for humans, and then transferred from person to person.
Now, this is very important when trying to figure out how to intervene, but the important thing is to keep track.
We can also show that the virus, during its transmission between humans, mutates.
And every transformation of this is very important, because the diagnoses, vaccinations, and treatments we use are all based on this genetic sequence, basically -- that's what it drives.
And so the world health experts must respond, they must evolve, to examine everything they were doing.
But the way science works, and the place I was at that moment, was that I had the information, could work in a monastery for many, many months, analyze the information carefully, delay the oldest paper to publish, go through several back and forth attempts, and finally when the paper is published, we can disclose the information.
That's how the situation is at the moment.
Well, that wasn't Levid at this point, was it?
We had friends in the front lines and it was clear to us that what we needed was help, a lot of help.
So the first thing we did was, once the sequence was out of the machines, we posted it online.
We spread it out to the whole world and said, "Help us".
And help came.
Before we knew it, we were contacted from all over the world, impressed by the information out there and published.
Some of the world's greatest virus followers have suddenly become part of our society.
We've been working together on this virtual route, sharing, making regular calls, continuing to try to track the virus minute by minute, to find ways to stop it.
And there are many ways we can have communities like this.
Everyone, especially when the pandemic began to spread worldwide, went out to learn, to share, to cope.
Everybody wants to play a part.
The amount of human capabilities out there was amazing, and the Internet brought us all together.
And you can imagine that instead of being afraid of each other, that's all we said, "Let's do this.
Let's work together and make this happen".
But the problem was that the information we all use, searching the Internet, is too limited to do what we need to do.
And so many opportunities were lost when this happened.
So in the early part of the Kinema outbreak, we had registered 106 cases, and again we made this publicly available to the world.
In our case, we were able to show that you can take the 106 records, can train a computer to predict and speculate about Ebola patients with almost 100% accuracy.
And we have created an app that can publish this, to make it available to healthcare workers in the field.
But 106ar is not enough to make it strong enough, to be positive.
So we are waiting for more information to be released.
And that information hasn't come yet.
We are still waiting, we are walking away, in the silos instead of working together.
And just... we can 't accept this.
You, all of you, can 't accept this.
It's our lives on the line.
In fact, in fact, we have lost many souls of many healthcare workers, including dear colleagues Lee, five colleagues Mballo Foney, Alex Waugh Boy, D. Humar Khan, Alice Koffama and Muhammad Fula.
These are just five of many health care workers in and around Kinema who died while the world waited and while we all worked quietly and alone.
So, Ebola, like all the dangers to humanity, is fraught with distrust, confusion and division.
When we build barriers between us and fight each other, the virus thrives.
But unlike the other threats to humanity, Ebola is the only thing we all have in common.
We are all in this war together.
Eparbola on the threshold of someone who could soon become our threshold.
So in this place with the same weaknesses, the same strengths, the same fears, the same hopes, I hope we can work together joyfully.
I had a graduate student reading a book about Sierra Leone, and I discovered the word "Kinema", the hospital we work in and the city we work in Sierra Leone, named after the word Mindy, which means "clean as a river, transparent and open to the public".
This was very profound for us, because without knowing it, we always felt that in honor of the people in the cinema where we worked, we had to work openly, we had to participate and work together.
And we should do that.
We all need to demand this of ourselves and others - to be open to each other when another epidemic strikes, to fight this war together.
Because this is not the first Ebola outbreak and will not be the last, there are many other microbes out there waiting, such as the Lassa virus and others.
And the next time this happens, which could happen in a city of millions, it could start there.
It could be something moving through the air.
It could even be a deliberate publication.
I understand that, but I also know, and this experience has shown us, that we have the technology and the ability to succeed at this thing, to succeed at this and to be the top word on viruses.
But we can only do it together and if we do it with joy.
And so to Dr. Khan and to all those who gave their lives in the front lines of this war with us always, let us be with them always in war,
Let us not make the world aware of the devastation caused by a single virus, but of billions of hearts and minds working in unity.
Thank you.
