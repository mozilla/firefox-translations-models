This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already popular, but shows details that fossils usually do not have the ability to show, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
. Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown on top with a pale or a carotenoid color on the underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called rachis, but have other functions for springs — barbs and holsters — scientists assumed that rachis was probably a later evolutionary evolutionary development, like the other relevant features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or appearance. The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample specimen shows adult plumage and not chicken down.
The researchers hypothesized that, although this was the tail of a dinosaur, the specimen showed the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chicken.

The work undertaken was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the Milky Way.
Just as the moon affects gravity on Earth, thus causing tides, the Milky Way affects the Sagittarius galaxy with its forces.
The researchers came to the conclusion that dark matter affects other dark matter in exactly the same way as normal matter does.
This theory holds that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll came across tuberculosis (XDR-TB) which was extremely resistant to medicine in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very disturbing and alarming because of the very high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll believes that some of the patients may have been infected by the bacterium at the hospital and at least two of them were health workers.
In a year's time, an infected person can quickly infect 10 to 15 of their close contacts.
On the other hand, the percentage XDR-TB in the entire population with tuberculosis appears to be low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected in South Africa.

In France, suffrage has traditionally been a low-tech experience: Voters enter alone in a cubicle, placing a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating their candidate's choice in an envelope.
After officials confirm the identity of the voter, the voter drops the envelope into the voting booth and signs the ballot petition.
French electoral law has quite strict codification of court proceedings.
Since 1988, voting booths must be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that no envelopes are present at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added except those carefully counted and from approved voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness all parts of the process. During the evening, volunteers count votes according to specific procedures and under strict control.

In her second race, she raced to tenth place in the women's seating area with a combined run time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than Austrian Claudia Loesch in first place and 1:09.02 minutes behind Gøngyi Dani of Hungary in ninth place.
In the women's sitting group, four skiers failed to complete the race, and 45 of the total 117 giant slalom athletes failed to advance.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and found her mobile and laptop."
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The accused appeared in court with their faces covered, Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, sustained serious head injuries.
Emergency services helped the driver out of the red Audi TT, while the street where the accident had occurred was temporarily closed.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in Edinburgh's court charged with killing her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitnesses may have been affected since her photo has been widely public.
This is common elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law works differently, so courts consider the publication of photos as potentially harming the victim.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes "journalists seem to be hanging by a thread if they publish photos etc. of suspects".
Journalists have been told by the Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutors, that no further comment will be made before indictment.
According to the leak, the document refers to the land border disputes, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders as they were before the 1967 war in the Middle East.
The future situation of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations and the Jordan Valley, was among the topics addressed.
Israel continues to demand a military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian state agrees to allow this force to remain for only five years.
Shooters in the supplemental pest control were closely monitored by forest rangers, this meant that the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and heritage at NPWS, the four shooters for the first shooting were given comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly sworn in a new 9-member electoral council (CEP) yesterday.
It's actually Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
A presidential commission last month recommended the earlier resignation of the Haitian Electoral Commission (CEP) as part of a package of measures to drive the country toward new elections.
The commission was a response by Martelly to widespread demonstrations against the regime, which began in October.
The sometimes violent demonstrations arose due to a lack of elections, some due since 2011.
Around 60 cases of overheated iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been aware of 27 accidents related to the facilities.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating events, which the company called "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "very regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (19:19. GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Office said no injuries were reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication that a tsunami was coming.
A Filipino man who used to be a police officer has held tourists in Hong Kong prisoner by hijacking their bus in the capital of the Philippines, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Eventually, photographers took the seat of an old woman when she needed the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital.
Liggins began investigating preterm labor in his spare time while working at the hospital.
His research showed that if a hormone were administered, it would speed up the development of the baby's lung.
Xinhua reported that state investigators recovered two "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated that "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died on the night of two moons. Quite unique, just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said that "Luna was as weird as me... maybe even more... love her and will miss her... Hopefully she's in a better place."
Of the 1400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed in her campaign at the 2010 federal election that Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 per cent in the poll share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II as Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim in both the 100m and 200m freestyle and three stages at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, doubts have begun about his form.
He has not been able to take the necessary medications to overcome the pain, because they are prohibited from the toys.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number yet on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, it was reported Tuesday.
Comets were perhaps the cause of water on Earth, as well as ecological matter that can form proteins and support life.
Since comets collided with Earth long ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially with regard to Earth.
Cuomo, 53, began serving as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and stupidity."
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, will make it possible to fly shorter routes and annually save a lot of fuel and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based technology that allows air traffic control to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport will be put in, trains above ground will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and short-term facilities are unavailable on the ground.
The possibility of being forced to play behind closed doors without the team's supporters was raised due to fears of lack of transport.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species had evolved in just two generations, although many had thought that this process would take much longer due to breeding between endemic Darwin finch, Middle Earth sparrow, and the cactus sparrow-immigrant Great Cactus Sparrow.
Gold can come in all sorts of forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire, which can also be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into a sheet.
It can be made very thin and firmly adhere to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used as decoration in the hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called a chemical pH. You can create an indicator using cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice will change color completely depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is marked by how many hydrogen ions (H in pH) are present in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons without electrons (as hydrogen atoms are one proton and one electron).
Stir together the two dry powders and then, with clean wet hands, press them together into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will have a reaction with the outer layers, and this feels strange and creates a kind of shell.
Almost all houses in the towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had water closets connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In the old days, there were also toilets in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and ladies were together.
The times you call someone thousands of kilometres away, you use satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent to space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the atmosphere of Earth causes some of our light and vision to be distorted.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 British feet to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in great ways. The best that the wheel has given us is a means of transport that is much easier and faster.
It has given us many transport units such as the train, the car and more.
Beneath those, there are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey such as hares to antelopes and roe deer.
Finally, there are several small pussycats (including loose pet cats) that eat the far more numerous prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to its success is the niche concept. A special job every cat has that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social felines and they live together in larger groups called alliances.
The alliances consist of 1–3 adult males who are related, along with up to thirty females and pups.
Females are usually closely related to each other, as they make up a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pack of lions behaves in much the same way as a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that have surprisingly much in common with the behavior of lions (but not with other big cats). They are also deadly to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (not very well), swim, jump over great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These 4 felines are the only ones roaring.
The tiger roar is not like the full-grown roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of gnawing words.
Ozelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and even birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the Ozelots hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that the ozelots follow suit and find animals to eat (prey) by smelling, sniffing the ground to find where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move completely unnoticed. Ozelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then attacking their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) are separated from the main population where they came from, for example if they are moving across a mountainous area or river, or moving to a new island so that they cannot easily move back, they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
The new population will need different features or customizations than what they needed before to be a strong competitor, since this new environment has different resources and different competitors.
The original population has not changed, they still need the same adaptation as before.
As the new people with time start to adapt to their new surroundings, they looked less and less like the other population.
After a few thousand years or after millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We have named this process speciation, which simply means the propagation of new species. Speciation is a consequence that cannot be avoided and is a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (so just exhale well).
The plants do their cooking from the sun using photosynthesis. They also supply shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Animals would not survive without plants.
The Mosasaurus was the supreme predator of its time, which was not afraid of anything, with the exception of other mosasauruses.
The long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the upper mouth, no one crossing its path came alive from it.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a bad tongue. Its diet included turtles, big fish, other mosaurs, and it may also have been a cannibal.
In addition, it also attacked anything that entered the water, even a giant dinosaur such as the Antarctic Dinosaur. T. rex would be no match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, Romans had their share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called seven-sleepers.
The fact that poor people and women ate their food while sitting in chairs, while the rich men liked to have banquets together where they lay on their sides while eating their meals, was another difference.
Ancient Roman meals may not have included foods that came to Europe from the United States or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn or tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no older Romans have tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built up a primary temple to each god and these were seen as the home of God.
People brought offerings to the gods and priests tried to fulfill the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes they built special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary made for the god.
Houses were not so essential in the high-temperate climate of the Middle East.
The Hebrew family lived mostly in the open.
The women did the cooking in the garden; Shops were only open counters pointing out onto the street. The houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in the lands around Canaan, which made the wood extremely expensive.
Greenland was little inhabited. In Norse sagas, it is told that Eric the Red was deported from Iceland for murder, and then they found Greenland while traveling west and christening it Greenland.
But there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time, regardless of his discovery.
There were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland, even though all the countries were "Scandinavian".
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you can probably imagine there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Despite the fact that something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was written: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text can be seen at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence, the large parchment document (it measures 293/4 inches by 241/2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
So the annotation was probably added as a label.
The invasion and subsequent D-Day battles liberated northern France, but southern France was still not liberated.
It was controlled by French "Vichy" individuals. These were French people who had negotiated peace with the Germans in 1940 and were actually working with the invaders instead of fighting them.
The August 15, 1940 invasion, when the Allies invaded southern France, was dubbed "Operation Dragoon".
Within just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated the southern part of France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a fairly large crowd of people who live and work together as a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, attached to Latin civis, meaning inhabitant, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and this in a way defines the size of society.
Urban states are forerunners of nations. A culture of civilization presupposes passing on knowledge through several generations, a linguistic footprint and fair dissemination that lasts.
Smaller cultures usually disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not seen as proper civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the Thirteen States formed a weak central government with Congress as its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national leader or judiciary, it depended on state governments, which were usually unwilling to cooperate in enforcing their actions.
It also had no authority to override the tax law and tariffs between the states.
The articles needed the unanimous endorsement of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian and German national teams are the second best teams in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 car sports are well-liked sports.
Winter sports are most popular in northern areas, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan's has almost 7,000 islands (the largest is called Honshu), making Japan the world's 7th largest island!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical context, as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginnings date back in the 1400s when European sailors passing by give the island the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated a shift to indigenous grain production practices, employing Chinese workers to work in their rice fields and sugar plantations.
Forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas under control in 1683, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) in 1895, the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki ceding the rights of Taiwan to Japan, which continued to rule the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has 3 important structures, i.e. Intihuatana, Sun Temple and Room with the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they were originally built.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu was fully restored in 1976 and restoration is still ongoing.
For example, 35mm is still the most common still photography format in the world, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, the digital camera's image sensor formats have inherited the aspect ratio of the camera.
It can be a bit confusing, but the 35mm format is actually 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio to this format (divide by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio), is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as APS family formats) are similar to, or approximately equal to, this aspect's ratios.
The rule of threefold is widely abused and often ridiculed, but is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while having a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective placement of the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds horizontally and vertically (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny during this period in European history.
For thousands of years, Christianity had bound together European states despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-pervading authority affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the essential principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to reduce pain and poverty, and that is why the funds for the church are there.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being followed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy demonstrated that the effect of cutting vital military and civilian supplies, even as the blockade violated widely accepted international law codified through multiple international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain bombed international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of sea, creating danger to even neutral ships.
Germany was prepared for a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare as there was limited response to this tactic.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
Having seen all the fears and horrors of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for Edison's firm in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a reference letter from Charles Batchelor (the job manager from his previous position) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods ; every phase of China or every family in power was a distinctive dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable age of divided provinces. The best known in these periods were the three Kingdoms that took place for 60 years between Han and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, there was fierce warfare between many kings fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest epochs in ancient China's history, when thousands of people died fighting to sit in the grand palace at Xiadel.
There are some social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a switch from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the nation is ruled by the citizens rather than just one ruler.
Even after the revolution, it was open to all male applicants who allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true of the Armed Forces, because instead of military rank schemes based on class, they now relied on caliber.
The French Revolution was the motivation for other oppressed working-class people in other nations to also initiate their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things that go beyond mortal life. He often used a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light), where he went to think.
The cave itself, which has been kept over the years, gives a very vivid presentation of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
On a mountaintop north of Mecca, the cave lies completely isolated from the rest of the planet.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
There is nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The only one of the seven wonders still standing today is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza necropolis" in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, includes many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to pay homage to Pharaoh Khufu, while many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were created to pay tribute to the wives and family members of Khufu.
The "upstroke" symbol is similar to a V and the "downstroke" symbol resembles a pin or a square without a bottom.
Up means you should start at the tip and slide the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and push the bow.
An upstroke usually brings out a softer sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more determined.
You may well adopt a pencil and make your own marks, but don't forget that the printed bowing marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be taken into account.
On 6 October 1789, the terrified royal family, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, along with their two young children (Marie Therese, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4), and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were pressured on 6 October 1789 to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
The king and queen returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd screaming and shouting threats at them.
The crowd forced the king and queen to have their carriage windows fully open.
A member of the gang at one point swung the head of a royal guard, killed at Versailles rather than the frightened queen.
The Filipino people themselves had to pay for the cost of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They had to pay taxes forcibly to the American colonial regime to cover much of the costs, and the interest on bonds was in the name of the Philippine government via the banking houses of Wall Street.
The super revenues derived from the exploitation of the Filipino people were a fundamental gain of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the circumstance that led to the creation of the order.
The age in which the events took place is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages in the period of European history which is the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages came after the Early Middle Ages and followed by the late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
The Mughal empire did not interfere with social culture and traditions for most of its existence, but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive ruling elites, leading to more systematic, centralized and uniformed rules.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general views: that the development of technology itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology additionally has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
One could say, for example, that the road development comes because of the car.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable if used by only a handful of cars, so new methods of manufacturing have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership is also creating more accidents on roads, which has led to the invention of new methods in the health sector to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a greater element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
What characterised romanticism was that the landscape shaped individuals and that over time geographical habits and cultures arose, and that these when they harmonized with their position in society were better than randomly imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the capital of fashion now in our time, Constantinople was seen as the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
It has been known to be an epicenter of luxury from about 400 e.Kr to around 1100 e.Kr.
The status was not the same in the 12th century, mainly due to the crusaders who had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were appreciated more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at its peak between the 10th–11th centuries and the 14th centuries.
At first, outfits were heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to create its own style. One of the biggest changes that came at the time, and as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to close clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture for the production of enough food to exactly meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often ecological, system that uses stored seeds belonging to the area combined with crop rotation or other techniques to maximize yields that are relatively simple.
Historically, most farmers were concerned with subsistence farming, which is still relevant in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel left out of social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be special because of their members' age, ethnicity, class, area, and/or gender.
The qualities that specify a subculture include linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of several factors.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialisation is to start with the few unfortunate cases in children who, through neglect, accident or intentional abuse, were not sufficiently socialised by adults during their childhood.
Such children are called "wild lungs". Some wild children have been kept in captivity by humans (usually their own parents), in some cases this was due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical impairments.
It is possible that children who are wild may have undergone serious child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or managed to escape.
Others were allegedly raised by animals; Some are said to have lived in nature on their own.
When a wild child is completely raised by animals, he develops behaviors (within physical limitations) that are almost identical to that of the rearing animal, such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based teaching makes learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it to a new level.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an aid that supports individuals who are undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program, or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and physical. In other words, a teacher can also be a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support functions are embedded in the software and are intended to question, prompt, and explain practices that may have been challenging for the learner to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even exploitation.
No kid should have to grow up in an atmosphere that isn't caring and educational, but it does happen.
We perceive that the foster child system is a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system will provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care should be able to provide all the necessities that they did not have in the home they came from.
It is a combination of elements with both mass and interpersonal communication on the internet.
The particular characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in relation to the approach of use and satisfaction.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialisation' are regarded as important motivating factors for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord also identified "personal engagement" and "sustained relationships" as emerging motivational aspects when they examined audience reactions to websites (1998).
Using video recordings, significant discoveries have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, movements of the face lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it has been argued that one can find out whether a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks suggests in his paper, The President's Tale, how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are still able to correctly assess sincerity.
He also argues that such abilities to explain human behavior can be shared by animals such as pet dogs.
According to modern research, there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new gene variation and the sample removes it from the sample of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination switch back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
It is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to get sufficient amino acids from the available plant resources out on the savannah.
What's more, not doing so has huge consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The proteins that are in leaves and legumes would be the most accessible plant resources, but these are difficult for primates like us to be able to digest without boiling them first.
Animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are in contrast not only easily digestible, but they also provide high-quantity proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
We should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" using quite the same method as the chimpanzees on the savannah use today.
Sleep interruption is the process of conscious awakening during the normal sleep period while falling asleep again a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved by using a fairly silent alarm clock that brings you to consciousness without completely waking you up.
If you find that you turn off the alarm during your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, and this causes you to have to get up to urinate.
How much inner peace a person is opposite correlated with how much tension there is in body and soul.
The less excitement, the more positive life force is present. All human beings have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can become enlightened. The only thing wrong with gaining such insight is our own effort and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded to include Mahayana's love direction and several methods from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and full love.
Kundalini energy can be awakened with Kundalini yoga through yoga poses, breathing training, mantra and visualization.
Tibetan meditation revolves around god yoga. The energy channels are cleansed by imagining different deities. In this way, the chakras are activated and consciousness is enlightened.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which caused cooperation between the USSR and the United States. The clashes between system, process and culture led to the demise of the countries towards the end of the war.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies had now become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and was to be fought by proxy armies on battlefields in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places in Africa to Asia.
By 17.09.1939 the Polish defenses were already broken down, and the last option was to return and reorganize along Romania.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 troops of the Soviet Red Army stepped in and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Peace Treaty and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is arguably the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
The campaign in the North Atlantic during World War II is one of the most important recent examples of this. The Americans attempted to move men and materials across the Atlantic to provide aid to Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic, mostly using submarines.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have managed to conquer Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Most likely, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
It began with ancient cultures and tribes retaining them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that walked on hills or other places for grazing, usually cared for by goat herders who were often children or adolescents, as were the more well-known shepherd. These methods of hardening are still used today.
Carriage tracks in England were made as early as the 1500s.
Although the carriage roads consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull to achieve greater speeds and pull more load than on the slightly rougher roads of that era.
To keep the tracks in place, the crossing cheek was introduced quite early. Little by little, however, it was realized that the tracks were more efficient if there was a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron created more wear and tear on the wooden wheels in the carriages.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first full iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first known means of transportation. Humans began walking upright 2 million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning upright man) emerged.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not usually walk upright.
Sahelanthropus may have walked with 2 legs as early as 7 million years ago, and bidirectional specialization in fossils has been discovered at Australopithecus from 4.2–3.9 million years ago.
We can start by having a lifestyle that is more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to reduce future pain to some extent.
This is many times just like symptomatic treatment. But if we don't just want a temporary solution, we should get to the root of the problems and remove them.
The world has changed greatly from the scientific and technological advances of mankind, as well as difficulties have become more complicated due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
A handwritten draft signed by Congressional President John Hancock and General Secretary Charles Thomson and then shipped a few blocks away to the printer of John Dunlap after its introduction by Congress on July 4.
Between 150 and 200 examples were made through the night and these are now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the garden of Independence Hall on July 8.
One arrived at George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A replica arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The first copy written by hand has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still live today – they are called birds.
Some people don't see them as real dinosaurs because they have feathers and the ability to fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all PCs used today are based on manipulation of information encoded with binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1. These numbers are referred to as binary digits — or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are generally not sufficient for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of open medicine containers or toxic household items on site.
For first aid guidance specifically for the poison in question, see the label.
Entomologists use the word insect in a formal sense for this income group.
This term derives from ancient association with mites, insects that are highly adapted to attack humans.
Both Assassin insects and Bed-insects are nidicolous, adapted to living in nests or the house of their host.
To our knowledge, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) across the United States, making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system that includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to get MS than men.
A couple may decide that raising a child isn't the best thing for them, or the child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method. Most scientific research, in fact, is guided by this method.
However, experimentation is not alone there, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the potential hypotheses by asking questions. Observations also help guide scientific research in the right direction.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in the Latin language.
Aristotle's views on everything related to science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek deteriorated, the West became more distant from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms that can be seen in physiology and behavior, as a rule, are completely dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been detected by virtually all living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, and not just in response to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-propelled oscillators that maintain a period of independent cycles without external influence.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the foremost proposals claiming that DNA could be a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phager, or in other words viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They made 2 attempts to label either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material being affected and whether the cells affected are bacteria-clinal cells.
Only mutations in bacterial cells can be transmitted to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including plant and animal life.
Examples of place activities involve hunting, fishing, photography, watching birds, going to parks and investigating details of the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive in cars to get to work outside the village, while others drive in the opposite direction because their workplace is in the village the others drive out of.
In this dynamic transport vehicle, everyone is in one way or another connected to, and supporters of, a transport system that is based on private cars.
Science shows that the great carbon economy has detached the biosphere from a stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Most people are dissatisfied with transportation systems.
In developed countries, one can rarely hear complaints about the quality of water or about bridges falling down.
Why do systems for transporting produce such dissatisfaction, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of individual drivers and vehicle movements between two points and the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is complicated, as it is impossible to predict the behaviour of drivers with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave with some consistency so that the traffic flow remains fairly consistent and with the possibility of being calculated mathematically with a reasonable degree of certainty.
To better show the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between three important characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of roadway systems.
Insects were the first animals that could fly. Their ability to fly made it easier and more efficient for them to escape enemies, find food and mates.
Most insects benefit from the fact that they can fold their wings backwards along their body.
Because of this, they have several small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold back their wings are dragonflies and citizen flies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus believed that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought the opposite, that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the sun (and the other stars).
This makes sense, because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is Earth's largest and second longest river. Here flows more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, it is ten kilometers wide in some places.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows out of students on Earth and into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi). It collects water from several thousand smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids were still built until the end of the ancient Egyptian Empire, they never exceeded the size and technical workmanship of the Giza pyramids.
Ancient New Kingdom Egyptians marveled at the monuments to their ancestors, who were then over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the language used by Vatican City in legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used in everyday life by government employees, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
Any inhabitant of the Vatican is Roman Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, as they are all found in their natural form in nature and because they are relatively easy to extract, even with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything involves a mixture of one or more of the earth's four elements. The four elements are earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the 4 states of matter (in equal order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also believed that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of 2 or more metals. Remember that there are a multitude of elements on the periodic table.
The elements calcium and potassium are seen as metal. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that a few trillions of them fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good helper for many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, now that newer methods of writing have appeared, the pencil has been considered of lower status and use.
People now write messages on computer screens and should never get close to a sniper.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard, when something newer arrives.
The fission bomb works on the principle that in order to assemble a nucleus with several protons and neutrons, energy is required.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Re-splits the core and releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to fall apart more or less unprovoked.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick at the front and 100 km thick at the long side.
Thinner under Mary, and thicker under the Highlands.
It is possible that there is more magma on the side towards us, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become more mature and approach adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they want and what things in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
As a rule, two patterns of behavior emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. One part of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the gang."
For these types of leaders, it can be difficult to make unpopular decisions, perform disciplinary actions, performance reviews, assign responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable person who feels he or she has to change absolutely everything that the team has done and make it his.
Ultimately, it is the manager who is responsible for whether the team wins or loses.
This behavior often ends in quarrels between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They usually have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet according to many different time zones, which the local management may not always understand.
An "invisible team" present (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p 109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible group" is the management group to which each member reports. The invisible group sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal is to put organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
If all available resources are used effectively by all functional departments in an organization, creativity and innovation can arise.
The process by which an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can thus lead to new innovative process that can help meet the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation and share knowledge and organizational learnings.
Angel (2006), explains the Continuum approach as a way to provide assistance to organizations to improve their performance levels.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition. It diminishes the area of research and makes it more precise.
The interaction between brain pathology and behavior is a confirmation for researchers in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, traumas and tumors affect behavior and cause alterations in some mental functions.
Brain structures and processes we have never seen before are now possible to investigate thanks to the emergence of new technologies.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes that take place in our brain.
Although artificial intelligence AI provides a strong sense of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, handling behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence is about creating machines for automation of tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include checking and scheduling the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting analytics, voice and facial recognition.
These have turned into separate disciplines that focus on coming up with solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and defense, which are built into several home PCs and computer game software.
Field trips are an essential part of any classroom. As a rule, teachers love to take students to places where a bus ride is not possible.
Technology allows for a solution with virtual field trips. Students can observe museum pieces, visit an aquarium, or admire great art while sitting with their class.
A great way to think about a journey and share experiences with future classes can also be to share the field trip virtually.
For example, every year students from Bennet school in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital, every year the site is reconstructed, but old versions are kept online to be used as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience will generally change that.
The blog writer began improving her writing to avoid criticism, as learners are often the most critical audience.
Also, blogging "forces students to be more up-to-date on the world around them." The need to give what is desired to the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that motivates them to work together, and encourages students to expand their learning ability beyond the typical school day they are used to.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students think more analytically and critically; By actively responding to internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada with several art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's history and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls and to the north, in Muskoka and beyond, you will find unspoiled nature in all its beauty.
All this and more, Ontario shows what outsiders consider authentic Canadian.
Large places to the north are very little inhabited and some places are almost exclusively uninhabited wilderness.
A comparison of population that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest of them, and is a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the nations, and it became popular in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism started in the 15th century, after Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
In the northern region it is bounded by the Sahel, on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Ladies: It is recommended that traveling ladies tell that they are married, regardless of what is actually the marital status.
It's also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they would see as harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm etc.
Be determined to say no to men, and don't have fear of standing your ground (cultural differences or not, that still doesn't make it acceptable!).
The city we know as Casablanca today was founded in the tenth century BC and was used as a strategic port under the name of Anfa by Berber fishermen, Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids.
The Portuguese tore it down and rebuilt it with the name Casa Branca, only to leave it abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan built up the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was called Casablanca because of Spanish merchants who had arranged their trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
Places where you can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagins, pottery, leather goods, hoodies and a whole spectrum of geias, are easy to find around the old medina, but they are mainly sold to tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is located in the east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava resulting from the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, the eruption caused most of the city's streets, especially the city center, to be buried.
Although Goma is quite safe, all visits outside Goma should be read about in advance to understand the fighting taking place in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing up the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the most affordable mountain hikes to see gorillas in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
"Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands, coupled with relative inaccessibility.
Although Timbuktu has its own airport and its reputation has made the city a tourist attraction, it is a very poor city.
Due to the threat posed by the desert sands, in 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites at Risk.
It was one of the big stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the cities in the rest of the country, because it has a more Arabic than African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located north-east in South Africa, in the east it is bordered by Mozambique, in the north by Zimbabwe, and the Crocodile River is its southern border.
The park is 19,500 km² and can be divided into 14 different ecozones, supporting different wildlife.
This is one of the most popular attractions in South Africa and it is considered the finest national park in South Africa (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card (a ticket), which grants admission to either a selection of parks, or all of the national parks in South Africa.
The name Hong Kong comes from Hong Kong Island, and is the place that many tourists consider as the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline in Hong Kong has been likened to a glittering bar chart that appears prominently thanks to the waters that make up Victoria Harbour.
If you want the finest view of Hong Kong, you can leave the island and travel to Kowloon's waterfront that lies above.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reconstruction land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took over, and this is a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past.
The largest beach zone on the planet is the Sundarbans, which are 80 kilometres (50 mi) inland into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that is within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps – here are some of the last remaining areas of jungle that once covered the gigantic plains.
The Sundarbans consist of an area of 3,850 km² with about a third of the area covered by water and marshland.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 axis deer in the area.
Buses depart from the bus terminal (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those that go east to Jakar/Bumthang, travel between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the district buses are often crowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Small Japanese coastal buses that are both comfortable and sturdy serve most districts.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapok River is a cable-stayed bridge. It straddles the Oyapok River and connects Oyapock and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers tower 83 meters, it is 378 meters high and it has two lanes of 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is fifteen meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was closed to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully operational from September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The most significant indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay was the Guaraní group, they were semi-nomadic hunters, but agriculture was also their livelihood.
The Chaco area was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 1500s, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies", became a country as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquerors with the natives.
The colonization period that lasted for 3 centuries was started by the Spaniards.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its own character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams with some of the best players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December, at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here.
See Asosiacion Argentina de Polo for news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The Falkland pound (FKP) is the official Falkland currency, the value of which is set equal to the value of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank located in Stanley above the FIC West store.
British Pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
Credit cards are not likely to be accepted on the outlying islands, but UK and US currencies may be accepted; Check with the owners in advance to find out what is an approved payment method.
It is difficult to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so be sure to exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there, while it is winter in the northern part of the planet and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in subtropical regions; during the summer months temperatures above +30 °C are common.
The cold can be misleading in winter as temperatures rarely go below freezing, but a combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There is no particular "rainy season" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain is the same throughout the year.
Most of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, but still, the animals are wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
You should stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves according to park authorities, and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
Bison, elk, deer, bears and almost all large animals can attack no matter how peaceable they may look.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured as they have not kept a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous meals and keep a clean camp.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and became the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
When seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave port in 1889, it became the notorious site of the naval protest.
Except for one British cruiser, all ships were sunk and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful city gathering led to the assassination of leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to Auckland's 2 harbours there are several beaches. The most popular are in 3 places.
The North Shore beaches of the North Harbor district are located in the Pacific Ocean. The beaches there stretch all the way from Long Bay in the north – to Devonsport in the south.
Almost all beaches are safe for swimming, and most have shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
Sometimes you will find crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast. It is safe to swim.
The main local beer is "Number One", which is not a complex but pleasant and refreshing beer. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that should be tested, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might be able to travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
For people from Australia, the idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is "espresso", cappuccino comes with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The cocoa lives up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but wonderful.
All year round there are many trips to the reef and injuries rarely occur due to any of these things.
Still, take government advice, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and near rivers from October to April north of 1770. They may occasionally be observed outside this period.
There are sharks, but it is unusual for them to attack humans. Most sharks have a fear of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live primarily in the ocean. Their primary residence is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking ahead gives the wayfarer peace of mind since they now have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although it may be possible to book lodging in other areas, such as a campsite, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually sell packages with breakfast included, airport transfers or even package combinations with flights and hotels.
They may also reserve a seat for you if you need time to think about an offer or get other documents for your appointment (such as a visa).
Various changes or requests should be made via the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festival guards decide to camp on site, and most of the guards consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to get a campsite close to the music.
Keep in mind that there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night even if the music on the main stage is finished.
At some festivals there are special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are going across the North Baltic Sea in winter, you should check the cabin's location, as driving through ice makes an extreme amount of noise for those who are most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos tend to make many attempts to maximize the amount of time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent and the outputs can be hard to find.
They usually have special food, drinks and entertainment for the guests, to keep them in a good mood and to make them want to stay on site.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages. But under the influence of alcohol impairs judgment, all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who will be driving at altitude or over a mountain pass should take into account the possibility of snow, ice or cold.
Friction is low, so on ice and snowy roads you cannot drive as you would on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, there may be enough snow for you to fall in a very short period of time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic is mostly uninterrupted all year round.
Safari is perhaps the largest form of tourism that draws tourists to Africa and is the main point for many visitors.
The term safari in popular coverage denotes trips to land to see the beautiful African wildlife, specifically on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, like to approach cars and standard equipment, which will allow good viewing angles.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards can be quite shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", or "balance walk") involves going on a hike, for either a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be from 24.08.2021 to 05.09.2021. Some events will be held elsewhere around Japan.
Tokyo becomes the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics. The city hosted the 1964 Games.
If you have booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be struggling.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March, the cancellation policy will not be extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most activity tickets will cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, and typical tickets with prices around ¥7000.
It may help to iron damp clothes to get them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan, even if it is not in the room.
If an iron is unavailable or you want to avoid wearing ironed socks, try using a hair dryer instead, if available.
Be careful not to make the fabric too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burn marks).
There are various ways to purify water and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil the water for a minute, while in others several minutes are needed.
Filters are different in terms of power, and if in doubt, you can buy the water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may come across infectious animal diseases that they don't know from their home areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritations, or in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins or pass on infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals capable of harming or killing humans with their power, are generally not qualified as plague.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to purchase goods that are exempt from tax and can only be purchased in certain locations.
Travelers going to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most challenging conditions for driving on the Buffalo–Pittsburgh highway are the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont, which often runs through isolated backforest terrain.
If you are unaccustomed to driving on country roads, keep a cool head: there are many steep climbs, narrow roads and sharp curves.
Speed limits posted are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections — usually 35–40 U.S. miles per hour (56–64 km/h) — and it's even more important to respect them than otherwise.
Oddly enough, mobile coverage is much better here than along many other places along the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very tasty. In Bavaria they are full-bodied and varied, comparable to the pastries of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit baking is common, with baked apples all year round, and cherries and plums have their entrance in the summer.
Many German pastries additionally contain nuts such as almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts that grow on trees. Many of the popular cakes taste extra good for a cup of strong coffee.

With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term, covering a wide variety of regional cuisines across the nation.
If used without further indication, however, the term usually means food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterised by lightly seasoned dishes, with a dominant taste of peanuts, chilli, sugar, (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups hang down either side of the saddle and are supports for the rider.
They provide more stability for the rider, but may be less safe due to the possibility of a rider getting stuck.
If a rider is thrown from a horse with one foot stuck in the stirrup, he may be dragged by the horse if it runs away. To mitigate this danger, many precautions can be taken.
Most riders, for starters, wear riding boots with heels and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Subsequently, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the leather of the stirrup to fall from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The largest climbing destination in Chile, Cochamó Valley, is known as South America's Yosemite, with many large walls and granite outcrops.

Downhill snow sports, which include both skis and snowboards, are popular sports that involve skiing down into snowy areas with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing holidays are a popular activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums", who plan entire holidays around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depict skiers dating back to as far as 5,000 f.Kr!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 1600s. In 1861, the first leisure-based ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity also has other names such as backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to, but usually does not include skiing in alpine style, or alpine climbing, the latter is done in steep terrain and then much stiffer skis and boots are needed.
Think of a ski trail as something like a hiking trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover greater distances than if you walk – but it is very rare that you will achieve great speeds without a heavy backpack in track.
Europe is a fairly small continent, but has many independent countries. In ordinary circumstances, a journey through multiple nations would mean more visa applications and passport checks.
The Schengen area, on the other hand, functions much like one country when it comes to this.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport checkpoints again.
At the same time, you do not have to apply for a visa to each individual Schengen member state if you have a Schengen visa, and you therefore save time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal explanation for what kind of produced articles are antiques. Some tax agencies view items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, including that the age limit may be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques despite being newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sami and also important for the trading culture for many with other occupations.
Although traditionally not all Sami have been involved in reindeer husbandry on a large scale, they lived by fishing, hunting and the like, while reindeer were mostly used as draught animals.
In our time, many of the Sami work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, Sámi area.

Regional and seasonal weather phenomena consist of blizzards, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of storms affecting their area, as it can affect on any travel plans.
Those planning to visit countries considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An Internet search for "hostile environmental courses" would likely come up with the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all of the issues mentioned here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually last two to five days and involves acting, some first aid and occasionally training with weapons.
It is common to have books and magazines about wilderness survival, but publications dealing with war zones are scarce.
Travellers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for their return journey.
The government's willingness to issue passports where gender is not marked (X) or documents updated to fit with a desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is just as variable.
Since September 11, 2001, security checkpoint searches have also become far more intrusive.
Preoperative transgender people should not expect to be able to get through the scanners with privacy and dignity intact.
Scratch currents are the recurring stream of waves breaking on the beach, a reef or the like.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated into a few deeper sections, and a fast current so that deep water can form there.
Most deaths take place due to exhaustion while attempting to swim back against the current, which can be very problematic.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more problematic than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be dragged along again or, depending on your skill and whether or not you've been noticed, you may be able to wait to be rescued.
A return shock occurs earlier than a culture shock (the stress phase is not there in the same way as when moving out), it lasts longer, and can become more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readapt to their own culture.
When you return home after living in another country, you have formed into the new culture and lost some of the old habits of your home culture.
The first time you traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, since they know that the traveler will have to adapt to a completely new country.
People may not expect patience and understanding to be needed for returning travelers as well.
One of the most exciting things in the area for kids is the pyramid's sound and light show.
The pyramids are visible at night and you have the opportunity to see them in peace and quiet before the show starts.
Usually you always hear the sound of tourists and sellers here. The story of sound and light is just like a storybook.
The sphinx is set both as a background and as the narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands found in 1819 have been claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with 16 active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest of them is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the flooded caldera of a volcano that's still active makes for a spectacular natural harbor.
The area south of the peninsula is Ellsworth Land, which is bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge into the plateau, then reemerge to form the 360 km long mountain range that is the Ellsworth Mountains, the bisect of the Minnesota glacier.
Mount Vinson Peak has an elevation of 4892 meters and is located on Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, in the northern part or Sentinel Range.
In remote locations with a lack of mobile coverage, satellite phones may be your only option.
A satellite phone usually cannot replace a mobile phone, as you must be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make a phone call.
The service is often used by ships, pleasure boats and also on expeditions that have remote data and contact needs.
You can get more information about connecting to this service from your local telephone service provider.
Getting lessons while traveling is an increasingly widespread option for those planning to take a gap year.
This is especially popular among Russians, allowing them to take a gap year before university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, embarking on a gap year abroad can actually improve your chances of getting into higher education once you return to your home country.
Typically, there will be a tuition fee to be enrolled in this type of education program.
Finland is a great destination for boat lovers. The "land of a thousand lakes" has thousands of islands as well, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
There is no need for a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelago and largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak provide a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland with one boat per 7th or 8th person.
Although this is the same for both Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, it is otherwise quite unique (as in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
The vast majority of the distinct Baltic Cruises had an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can spend a couple of full days in the historic city, heading back to the boat to sleep at night.
If you only go ashore using ship excursions, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some of the cruises have included Berlin in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and the trip there is therefore not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before or if they've experienced a traumatic event.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, it's no different from other things that a lot of people fear or dislike.
For some, understanding how the plane works and what occurs when flying can help to overcome a fear based on the unknown or not having control.
Shipping companies get a lot of money for delivering things quickly. Often time is very important when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies use their own aircraft, but for smaller companies it was problematic.
If they shipped things by air freight, it may have taken days on some routes to get through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't let them send luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to fork out a thick stack of money for the privilege (or better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, this is not reasonable: as a rough rule of thumb, you can prepare to pay up to four times more than the usual economy price for Business Class, and eleven times more for First Class!
Generally speaking, there is no point in looking for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain group of flyers who are willing to pay well to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and pay accordingly.
Chişinău is the capital of Moldova. Romanian is the local language, but Russian is also widely used.
The multi-ethnic republic of Moldova has suffered from ethnic conflicts.

Barcelona's official languages are both Catalan and Spanish. Around half prefer Catalan, and most have an understanding of that language, but practically everyone knows Spanish.
Most signs, however, are only indicated in Catalan because it is legislated as the first official language.
Spanish is also used in public transport and other facilities however.
Regular messages at the Metro station are only done in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system with a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The reputation of Parisians is that they are egocentric, rude and arrogant.

The fast façade of Parisians quickly disappears if you show some basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered by a lot of forest, mainly of beech, spruce forest and spruce trees, and is characterized by a mixture of high mountain and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly large variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils, and varying levels of elevation.

When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries offer shawls to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own and especially if it has bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Along the same line, men are required to wear pants that go above the knees.
This may also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance, but the clothes may not be washed after each wearer, so it may be less comfortable to wear these skirts. One size for everyone!
Cuisine in Mallorca, like similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil for everything.

Pre-modern observatories are usually somewhat obsolete in our time and are often used for museums or educational sites.
As light pollution was not the type of problem in their heyday as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses that are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with favourable atmosphere conditions.
The cherry blossoms on display have been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century and are also known as hanami.
The concept came from China where blooming plum flowers was the most popular flower.
The first cherry blossom feasts were arranged by the emperor of Japan only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
The plants look best in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally landscaped garden and pick a few "samples", you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is usually a place with high security, it is a very easy place to find your way around, and you can get most things there after you arrive.
However, if you are placed in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you need to consider both warm (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which does not occur as often).
There are also a couple of buses heading north to the city of Hebron, to the traditional burial place where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives are buried.

Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions that we have during the holiday season have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
It is a tradition to stay awake through the Easter night at an exposed point to watch the sunrise.
It may well have been a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual, but of course there are also Christian theological interpretations of this tradition.
Several traditional churches often hold the Easter service on a Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with the conventions often starting the celebration of Christ's resurrection at midnight.
All animals that originally came to the islands did so by swimming, flying or floating.
The mammals were unable to travel due to their long distance to the continent, making the large land turtle the first grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Many mammals have been introduced since humans arrived in the Galapagos, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, during which time the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to discover the Aurora Borealis, as the sky remains dark more or less around the clock.
As the sites are sparsely populated and light pollution is rarely a problem, you will also have the opportunity to see the stars.
