&quot;MG Baltic&quot; case: Gustaini&#39;s new lawyer says that he has not yet had time to familiarize himself with the case material
All the defendants gathered at the eleventh court session of the &quot;MG Baltic&quot; case on Monday: Šarūnas Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavičius, Vytautas Gabšys, Eligijus Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The court session began with the testimony of the defendants.
In the last court session, the state appointed the new Š. Gusteinis&#39; lawyer Aleksandars Doroshevas told the panel of judges that he had not yet had time to familiarize himself with the case materials.
Then the lawyer of &quot;MG Baltic&quot; Linas Belevičius stated that in order to ensure a full-fledged defense of the person, the panel of judges must allow the new lawyer to get acquainted with the case material and asked to postpone the court session.
&quot;In order to ensure the defense of a person, he must familiarize himself with the material of the criminal case.
This is not just a formal meeting,&quot; said L. Belevičius.
The new lawyer A. Doroševas noted that he did not have time to familiarize himself with either the indictment or all the case materials.
In the previous court session, the suspect Š. Gustainis announced that he would give up his lawyer because he would no longer be able to pay him.
Audio recordings were also heard at the hearing.
The defendants&#39; lawyers complained that the audio recordings presented to the court were of poor quality.
Law enforcement suspects that politicians, taking bribes from MG Baltic, supported or initiated decisions favorable to the concern in the Seimas and other state institutions, and also had an impact on determining the winners of public procurements, reminds ELTA.
During the pre-trial investigation, more than 150 persons were interviewed, of which more than 50 are members of the Seimas of the previous and current term, several former ministers, members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 surveys and more than 30 searches were conducted.
It is suspected that Sh. Gustainis received more than 8 thousand. EUR bribe, G. Steponavičius - 15 thousand. EUR, V. Gapšys - more than 27 thousand. E. Masiulis is suspected of taking more than 106 thousand euro bribe.
The Labor Party is suspected of bribery and influence peddling, the Liberal Movement is suspected of bribery, influence peddling and abuse, and &quot;MG Baltic&quot; is suspected of bribery and influence peddling by these parties.
It is suspected that the politicians discussed bribes with R. Kurlianskis, vice president of the &quot;MG Baltic&quot; concern, and later proposed or supported initiatives favorable to the concern in the Seimas or other institutions.
Guardians of Ethics: The Board of the Liberal Movement is right about the act of the Vilnius branch
&quot;Decisions made by the board are in accordance with the statutes&quot;, its head Vytautas Tamošiūnas told BNS after the commission&#39;s meeting.
&quot;Our decision was not something new.
We had already made the clarification as a commission in July, when the question about Pagėgiai and Utena arose.
Then we said that under the statutes it was a matter of board competence.
And if the board decides that some section can do as it wants - to go with the committee and the board approves it, then the section can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, which is what the board accepted, then it is a decision that all departments would form party lists.
And if there is no agreement with the board, then there is a possibility to suspend the membership and go with the committee,&quot; he added.
According to V. Tamošiūnas, the party board will now decide on further actions.
On October 17, the board of the Liberal Movement party canceled the decision of the Vilnius city branch to participate in the municipal elections not with the party&#39;s list, but with the list of the newly formed election committee.
In the opinion of the party board, the decision of the capital&#39;s liberals to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party statutes and board decisions.
By October 31, the Vilnius branch had to withdraw its aspirations to participate in the municipal elections with the committee&#39;s list.
But the department did not.
The former head of the department, MP Aušrinė Armonaitė, has already left the Liberal movement.
The mayor of Vilnius, the former chairman of the Liberal Movement, Remigijus Šimašius, who promises to seek another term as the head of the capital, has already presented the public election committee&#39;s &quot;For Vilnius, which we are proud of!&quot; team and ideas.
He also left the party.
Elections of municipal councils and mayors will be held in March next year.
Residents of a village in northern India used a tractor to run over a tiger that had earlier mauled a man, officials said Monday.
Forest Service Officer Mahavir Kaujlagis said that after the tiger mauled a man working in the fields late on Sunday, villagers surrounded the animal and ran it over with a tractor as the female tried to escape.
Residents say that this tigress also attacked and mauled one youth about 10 days ago.
The village in question is located in the Dudhva Tiger Reserve in Lakhympur Kheri district, about 250 km southeast of Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh state.
Hunting tigers in protected areas is prohibited.
Ramesh Pandey, director of the sanctuary, said that the incident will be reported to the police under the Wildlife Protection Act.
In April, villagers mauled another tiger in Uttar Pradesh&#39;s Nighasan district; he suffered serious injuries.
The tiger is the national animal of India; tigers are considered an endangered species under the Wildlife Protection Act.
Government figures from last year showed at least one person was killed every day in encounters with wild tigers or elephants in the previous three years.
Human conflicts with tigers have been on the rise since the 1980s, when India launched a tiger conservation program that established sanctuaries in national parks and made poaching of the big cats a crime.
Although the methods of counting tigers have changed, censuses would show that the then population of about 1,800 tigers has increased to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
It is proposed that cats and dogs be marked with microchips
Chairman of the Environmental Protection Committee of the Seimas, Kęstutis Mažeika, together with other members of the Seimas, registered amendments to the Law on Animal Welfare and Protection, in which it is proposed that cats and dogs be marked with subcutaneous microchips.
&quot;We propose that cats and dogs should be marked with subcutaneous microchips, and their registration and marking should be organized by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be marked free of charge with state funds, and in 2020 - also cats, so residents will not have to worry and the costs will be covered by specially provided state funding,&quot; said Kęstutis Mažeika, chairman of the Environmental Protection Committee of the Seimas.
The amendments to the law aim to address the systemic need for pet labeling.
It is hoped that this will help prevent problems caused by irresponsible breeders, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is preliminarily estimated that, according to the expected average cost of the microchip and service provision, which will reach around 5 euros, all animal owners will be compensated during the transition period.
The total cost of tagging all pets can reach up to 6 million. euros.
It is planned that the need for these funds will be distributed over three years and will reach 2 million each year. euros.
It is expected that the funds for the labeling programs will be allocated through the Municipal Environmental Protection Support Special Program, the income of which will increase significantly this year due to increased natural resource taxes and redistribution of funds.
Municipalities will be able to use these funds not only for marking cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programs.
According to K. Mažeika, the practice of mandatory marking is widespread in almost all European Union countries, it allows protecting the animals themselves (because lost ones can easily be returned to their owners), and saves the time of the animal breeders themselves, when a lot of time and money has to be devoted to searching for an escaped and lost pet.
In addition, EU legislation stipulates that you can only travel with tagged pets.
At the same time, labeling obliges to take responsible care of the animal throughout its life.
Previous proposals for mandatory labeling were met with resistance, as the corresponding programs were proposed to be financed with the funds of the population.
&quot;The current model should avoid this criticism, because animal protection is proposed to be financed with increased income in the environmental protection support program and the right to label is granted not only to veterinarians, but also to members of the public, i.e. persons from animal welfare institutions who have attended special courses at the Veterinary Academy&quot;, - say the authors of the project .
The draft law was registered by a group of Seimas members representing different Seimas factions - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

He added that four other soldiers were wounded in the attack on a joint army-police checkpoint in Khogyan district.
According to A. Noori, during the three-hour battle with the Afghan forces, six fighters were killed and another ten Taliban were wounded.

Rytas extended a helping hand to the Ukrainian club
The fourth round match of the FIBA European Cup will be held on Wednesday in the Vilnius &quot;Ryto&quot; arena, where the clubs of Kosovo and Ukraine will meet.
The duel will be held in the capital for political reasons.
Vilnius &quot;Rytas&quot;, which maintains warm relations with Ukrainian basketball, will host the teams of Cherkasy &quot;Cherkaski Mavpy&quot; and &quot;KB Prishtina&quot; of Priština under its roof at the &quot;Rytas&quot; arena on November 7.
&quot;Due to political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine, we could not hold this match at home, so we are very happy that our friends from Vilnius agreed to host us,&quot; Maksimas Michelson, the head coach of the Ukrainian team, thanked &quot;Ryt&quot;.
- We have many friends in Vilnius, and our countries always get along well with each other.
Lithuania is one of the countries with the best basketball traditions in the world, so it will be a real honor for us to play here.
We hope that we will receive support from the people of Vilnius.
The Kosovo team could not come to Ukraine, as these countries do not have any diplomatic relations.
Currently, the Ukrainian team is in third place after the first round with one win in three meetings, while the Kosovo team is in the second position and has more wins.
This will be a very important clash in Group E, as only two teams will advance to the next round.

Then the Ukrainian team celebrated a 100:61 victory.
Basketball fans will be able to enter the match for free on Wednesday, and the match starts at 19:00.
&quot;Women lie better&quot; star actress B. Arsobaite is being chased by liars
It&#39;s probably just a coincidence, but the charming brown-eyed actress Brigita Arsobaitė has already received roles related to liars several times.
First, the series &quot;Women lie better&quot;, then the play &quot;Liars&quot; and finally the comedy &quot;Liars&quot;.
In this film, Brigita plays the flirtatious wife of the hero of Dainius Kazlauskas.
&quot;I really liked filming in &quot;Liars&quot; because I&#39;m more of a theater actress and I rarely appear in the cinema.
The assembled wonderful team of colleagues promised a great result from the very beginning.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the pitch was Sunny the puppy!
All my life I thought that if I had a dog, it would definitely be big and serious.
I&#39;ve never been a fan of those little, decorative &quot;fifa&quot; quadrupeds.
However, during the filming, Sunny became so attached to me that the sympathy became mutual and in the end I even wanted to buy her from the hostess, but to no avail,&quot; the actress smiles.
From the very first minutes, the new Lithuanian comedy &quot;Liars&quot;, produced by Paulius Virbickas, the producer of the Lithuanian movie hits &quot;Nepatyrês&quot; and &quot;Tarp mõus, boysenkių...&quot;, and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimiras Razarionovas, plunge into the comical and intriguing vicissitudes of family members.
Your lover just announced - she is expecting.
That would be great news, except... your sweetheart is your brother&#39;s wife!
But that&#39;s not all.
Before the &quot;good news&quot; can be announced to everyone, the parents suddenly announce - they are getting a divorce!
After 50 years together...
And all this happens right before the most beautiful holidays of the year - St. Christmas!
But the end will surprise even more, because no one expected such a twist.
All heroes are not what they seem at first glance...
In addition to B. Arsobaitė, in the comedy &quot;Liars&quot;, the four-time movie stars Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Uzaitė, Giedrė Giedraitytė, Liubomiras Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis will give the audience a good mood.
Comedy &quot;Liars&quot; - in theaters from November 9.
Will decide whether to write off 100 mln. unpaid taxes of emigrants
On Tuesday, the Seimas accepted for consideration the amendment to the Law on Declaration of Place of Residence prepared by the leader of the &quot;peasants&quot; Ramūnas Karbauskis.
56 Seimas members voted for, 9 against, and 25 abstained.
Next, the Seimas will consider the amendments on or after December 6, after receiving the Government&#39;s conclusion.
According to R. Karbauskis, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the MP, one person does not pay about 1 thousand in three years. euros, and now there are about 100 thousand such persons.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sys regretted that in this way the Seimas &quot;will urge some people not to comply with their obligations&quot; - to declare departure and then no taxes would be calculated.
Conservative Antanas Matulas, a member of the Health Affairs Committee, noticed that Lithuanians living abroad take advantage of the fact that by paying a small health insurance tax, they come to Lithuania for treatment - they are provided with the same services as residents who pay this tax.
The amendments provide that persons who will pay social insurance contributions in the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation will be considered to have left Lithuania, and &quot;Sodra&quot; will exempt them from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
Mindaugas Sinkevičius, the head of &quot;Sodra&quot;, has previously said that such a step will facilitate both the lives of emigrants and the activities of &quot;Sodra&quot;.
A video of a sliding teddy bear that has gone viral reveals a serious problem
Filmed as a mother bear climbs a steep snowy slope, while the cub keeps climbing, sliding down and climbing again tenaciously.
The video received many views and comments.
People admired the tenacity of the little bear - after repeatedly sliding down, he climbed back to his mother.
He does not succeed the first time, but the little one does not try to give up and finally achieves his goal.
The video really commands attention, but it also exposes the threat humans pose to animals.
Scientists claim that it is necessary to talk about the fact that people&#39;s desire to know wild nature can sometimes be harmful.
&quot;It is obvious to me that the bears were very scared by the drone.
Their movements show that they are panicking.
If there wasn&#39;t a drone flying around, they likely would have taken a safer route or taken it slower or more carefully.
It&#39;s a great example of how drones shouldn&#39;t be used,&quot; ecologist Mark Ditmer told The Verge.
Some time ago, Mr. Ditmer and his colleagues studied how drones affect bears.
The animals were fitted with heart rate monitors.
When the drone approached, some bears started to run, others did not run anywhere, but all of their hearts started to beat faster due to fear.
Scientists advise the responsible use of drones for filming animals, not to fly too close, not to make noise and not to fly where it is prohibited.
The fugitive president was addressed through the newspaper
On Tuesday, the court in Kyiv summoned the deposed president Viktor Yanukovych, who had fled to Russia, to appear at the hearing of the case regarding his alleged treason in an unusual way - the summons was published in the state&#39;s official gazette.
In a court summons published in the government news paper &quot;Uriadovoj kurjer&quot;, the former leader is invited to appear at the hearing of the criminal trial on November 19, during which his closing arguments could be heard.
The document states that V. Yanukovych has the right to participate in the meeting via video link.
On October 30, the Kyiv court announced that it had finished the debate in V. Yanukovych&#39;s case.
Aleksandr Goroshinsky, Yanukovych&#39;s lawyer working in Russia, has been given until November 19 to register with the foreign attorneys&#39; register so that he can attend the hearing where Yanukovych is expected to deliver his final speech via video link.
The Kremlin-backed V. Yanukovych was overthrown and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, provoked by the president&#39;s refusal to sign the association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader had been taken to Russia in a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula belonging to Ukraine, and a little later a war broke out in the east of the country between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists.
Since then, the fighting has killed about 10,000 people. lives, despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure a lasting ceasefire.

Restrictions on cogeneration power plants are appealed to the Constitutional Court
As promised, the opposition of the Seimas appealed to the Constitutional Court (CT) the ruling decision to pass a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incineration power plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition faction of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) in the Seimas reported that a group of Seimas members turned to the Constitutional Court, asking them to investigate the compliance of the amendments to the Waste Management Law adopted by the ruling party with the Constitution.
&quot;Parliamentarians emphasize that the provisions of the law aim to question the projects of waste incineration facilities that are currently being implemented, instructing the Government to establish new restrictions (20 km distance from the residential area) for the construction of waste incineration plants started in Vilnius and Kaunas before the law comes into force,&quot; the report reads.
&quot;Parliamentarians note that taking into account the way in which the ban on building waste management facilities of state importance is formulated in the law (that is, the distance is determined and the concept of &quot;residential territory&quot; is defined), it can be concluded that this ban disproportionately restricts or even denies the very right to carry out economic activities, related to the incineration of waste for energy production, because the established criteria are formulated in such a way that, considering the density and distribution of the Lithuanian population in the country, it would be practically impossible to build such objects in the entire territory of the country,&quot; it added.
The appeal states that the adopted law contradicts the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
&quot;KT has repeatedly indicated that legal acts do not apply to those legal facts and consequences that occurred before the newly adopted legal act came into force.
In this case, the Government is given the power to apply the law retroactively, according to an undefined criterion.
If such legal regulation is established, the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal security, protection of legitimate expectations, and thus the constitutional principle of the rule of law, are violated,&quot; the appeal states.
It also notes that large financial investments have already been made in the Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration power plant projects.
If the currently ongoing projects are stopped, the state would suffer not only hundreds of millions of dollars in financial losses, Lithuanian residents would also suffer huge losses - heating prices would increase, and environmental pollution would increase due to the growing amount of waste disposal in landfills.
The appeal to the KT was signed by members of the Seimas TS-LKD, the Liberal Movement, the Social Democratic factions, and Algirdas Butkevičius, the deputy elder of the ruling Social Democratic labor faction.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas managed to collect 71 votes with the votes of those in power to reject the amendments to the Waste Management Law vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaitė, which provide for the Government&#39;s right to stop the construction of cogeneration power plants that have already started, and also set a &quot;quarantine&quot; zone 20 km from residential areas for the construction of such power plants.
Amendments to the law re-adopted by the Seimas will enter into force from 2019. January 1 True, the authorities are already proposing to abandon the 20 km limit.
This proposal is planned to be discussed in the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, there are no plans to waive the Government&#39;s right to stop already started projects.
The Supreme Court will examine this case in order of priority - no earlier than a year later.
The questionable statistics of LeBron James in the &quot;Lakers&quot; club were made public
The start of LeBron James&#39; career with the Los Angeles Lakers is not what he, the organization and basketball fans expected.
The Lakers started the season with four wins and six losses, a weak start that helped spark rumors of a possible firing for coach Luke Walton.
However, such talks were calmed down by the president of basketball operations, Magic Johnson, who stated that he will not fire the coach, but he needs to play better.
The biggest star of the team, L. James, should also look at himself.
Although the forward&#39;s statistics are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 assists.
But she is not telling the whole truth.
During the first ten games of the season, other numbers emerged showing that the Lakers play better when L. James is not on the court.
A negative +/- statistic for a forward, which shows how many more points a team scores or concedes when certain players are on the court.
When L. James is on the court, the Lakers have allowed 30 points more than their opponents this season.
While he was sitting on the bench, &quot;ežerūnai&quot; scored 19 points more than the opponents.
At the moment, the Lakers are only in 13th place in the Western Conference, but a few victories can turn everything upside down.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
It was noted at the meeting that Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
&quot;Lithuania highly values Spain&#39;s cooperation with NATO and its significant contribution to ensuring the security of our country and the region,&quot; said Minister L. Linkevičius.
The Spanish Air Force has already carried out NATO air police and air police reinforcement missions in the Baltic States five times, three of them in Lithuania.
The last time the Spanish &quot;Eurofighter&quot; fighters were deployed in Šiauliai in May-August of this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
The minister also noted that there are regular consultations between Lithuania and Spain on issues of security, political, economic and strategic communication in the fight against propaganda.
L. Linkevičius expressed hope that Lithuania and Spain will continue to cooperate closely in solving European, transatlantic agenda and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004, when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador Jose Maria Robles Fraga is the fifth representative of Spain in Lithuania.
On October 29, Jose Maria Roblesas Fraga presented the credentials to President Dalia Grybauskaita.
V. Ačienė about the arrest of R. Ačas: I believe in the man&#39;s innocence and law enforcement
&quot;For me, it was the most unexpected thing that I could ever think of.
On the other hand, the services are probably doing the work they are supposed to do.
We all do our job.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband, that everything is fair and honest, that no unfair actions should be taken by him,&quot; V. Ačienė told BNS.
R. Ača was arrested by the Special Investigation Service (STT) on Monday - the law enforcement suspects that he, while still the director of the Raseiniai municipality administration, took a bribe of a large value, and in exchange he was able to create exceptional conditions for a private company that signed a contract with the Raseiniai bus fleet managed by the municipality.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of directly bribing R. Ačas or participating in disguising bribes in various financial transactions.
Raseiniai district municipal council dismissed R. Ača from the position of head of administration in April this year in the third attempt after expressing no confidence.
The former &quot;tvarkietis&quot; became a member of the newly founded Lithuanian Social Democratic Labor Party led by Gediminas Kirkilas in March of this year, he suspended his membership in this party on Monday.
A few years ago, R. Ačas ran unsuccessfully as a representative of the election committee &quot;Tavo Raseiniai&quot; in the mayoral elections.
V. Ačienė says that the man did not intend to raise his candidacy in the Raseiniai mayoral elections next year, but he had not yet decided whether he would participate in the municipal council elections.
V. Ačienė was elected to the Seimas on the list of the Union of Lithuanian Peasants and Greens, she is a member of the Anti-Corruption Commission of the Seimas.
The politician says that she is waiting for further actions by law enforcement - it will depend on whether she will resign from the commission.
&quot;I really don&#39;t make sudden decisions today, I think I will make up my mind this week.
I will see, if there is a need, what the charges are, of course, I will make one or the other decision.
It is probably necessary for me to stay away from all matters that are being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again - time will put everything in its place,&quot; she said.
The representative of the opposition conservatives in the Seimas, Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė, called on the Speaker of the Seimas, Viktoras Pranckietis, and the leader of the &quot;villagers&quot;, Ramūnas Karbauskis, to distance themselves from the statements of their faction colleague Vidas Ačienė, and to recall her from the Seimas Anti-corruption Commission, transferring her to another Seimas committee or commission.
She claims that V. Ačienė&#39;s continued work in the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission &quot;would cause justified mistrust in society and discredit the work of an important parliamentary oversight commission&quot;.

Grybauskaitė calls on China to create a more favorable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a more favorable investment environment for European Union (EU) countries&#39; investments, to facilitate foreign import conditions.
Opening the trade and investment forum at the Chinese import exhibition in Shanghai, D. Grybauskaitė emphasized that, seeing signs of economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be to &quot;unite efforts in stopping the spread of protectionism in the world&quot;, targeting the fundamental tensions caused by trade wars, &quot;overproduction and unfair competition &quot; reason.
&quot;For the European Union, China&#39;s commitment to create a more attractive, open environment for investment is very important - this is important when negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to complete this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign business feels welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property,&quot; said D. Grybauskaitė.
According to her, the opening of China is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The head of Lithuania emphasized that the transparency of investments must be &quot;above the interests of any business group&quot;.
&quot;Transparency, the supremacy of laws, strict adherence to international agreements - this must be essential for the environment of new investment relations&quot;, - emphasized D. Grybauskaitė.
&quot;Corrupt capital flows should not be welcomed in any country in the world - not only here or in our countries,&quot; she added.
China&#39;s import expo is trying to defuse criticism that it shies away from opening up its market and only patronizes its own companies.
Heads of dozens of countries, more than 2,800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania, are participating in the exhibition.
According to the Lithuanian Statistics Department, China currently ranks 25th among export partners.
Last year, Lithuanian exports to China grew by 50 percent. - it amounted to 180 million euros.
At the same time, the volume of imports from China exceeded 820 million. euros.
Some officials are worried that Chinese investments in Lithuania may bring unwanted political influence, and Beijing&#39;s exclusive focus on Eastern Europe is dividing EU unity.

The cause of the Lion Air plane crash has been revealed: the relatives of the dead are angry
Black box data from the crashed Indonesian airliner Lion Air show that the speedometer malfunctioned on at least four of its last flights, investigators said Monday.
National Transport Safety Committee (NTSK) chairman Soerjanto Tjahjono said a similar incident had occurred during the plane&#39;s last four flights, including the fatal one when the airliner crashed in the Java Sea on Oct. 29 shortly after takeoff from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board died in this crash.
Many media outlets reported on the malfunctions during the previous flight of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
&quot;When we opened the black box - yes, actually the technical problem was the speed in the air, in other words, the speed of the plane,&quot; S. Tjahjono said during the press conference.
&quot;The black box data showed that there was the same problem on the two flights before the Denpasar-Jakarta flight,&quot; he added.
&quot;There are many rumors circulating on social networks.
Now we want to clarify that the black box (retains data) about four flights during which there were problems with the speedometer in the air,&quot; said the head of the NTSK.
During a meeting with family members of the victims, Mr. Tjahjono said that the information from the flight data recorder was consistent with reports that the plane&#39;s speed and altitude changed erratically after takeoff on its last flight.
Search teams have yet to find the second black box that records the conversations in the cockpit.
&quot;Lion Air&quot; stated that when a technical fault was detected during the flight from Bali to Jakarta, it was repaired according to the manufacturer&#39;s recommendations.
One of the company&#39;s founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak by Transport Minister Budi Karyos Sumadi, who moderated a meeting between family members and officials overseeing the search for the plane and victims&#39; remains and the crash investigation.
However, he stood up and bowed his head when angry and grieving family members demanded that R. Kirana, who founded Lion Air with his brother Kusnan in 1999, introduce himself.
&quot;Lion Air behaved inappropriately,&quot; said one man who identified himself as the father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island the plane was flying to.
&quot;I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention,&quot; he emphasized.
- Since the beginning of the crisis, &quot;Lion Air&quot; has never contacted me.
We lost our child, but Lion Air showed us no mercy.&quot;
After this meeting, R. Kirana hastily left, avoiding questions from journalists.
Many families are waiting for the results of the long process of identifying the dead.
Almost 140 body bags filled with parts of human remains were handed over to police medical experts.
Only 14 victims have been identified so far.
Relatives have questioned why the airliner, which entered service two months ago, was allowed to fly despite a malfunction on the Oct. 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta, which, among other things, caused the plane to plunge immediately after takeoff, frightening passengers.
Lion Air said the fault had been fixed.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? - asked the son of one of the dead.
- If not, the relevant technicians must be held accountable.
The law is very clear, they did not claim that the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must be held accountable by law to prevent plane crashes in Indonesia from happening again.
Mr. Tjahjono said that the large amount of small debris and the fact that the wreckage was spread over a relatively small area indicated that the liner probably crashed into the water while flying at a very high speed.
&quot;The plane was intact when it fell into the sea.
It didn&#39;t explode in the air, and the plane&#39;s engines were running at high speeds when it touched the water - this is evidenced by all the broken turbine blades,&quot; the official explained.
The crash of the Lion Air airliner is the worst aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when a Garuda plane crashed near Medan, killing 234 people.
After the accident, rescuers were leading from the wreckage: a minor was also injured
On Monday evening, BMW and Mercedes-Benz cars collided on the road Vēžaičiai - Plungė, near Tilvikai.
The cars collided head-on, and it is reported that three people were injured.
It is reported that the driver of the BMW, born in 1999, drove into the opposite direction of traffic and crashed head-on into a Mercedes-Benz car in which a father, born in 1967, and a daughter, born in 2005, were traveling.
The BMW driver was rescued from the wreckage by firefighters - rescuers.
The girl from &quot;Mercedes-Benz&quot; had her teeth knocked out in the accident.
All the victims were taken to the hospital.
Presidency: No artificial relief is needed for the referendum
After the Seimas approves the government&#39;s proposal to lower the referendum bar for the first section of the Constitution, which currently has greater protection, the president will veto the amendments, says her advisor Mindaugas Lingė.
&quot;More than half of the population voted for the Constitution - that is the requirement.
This and its change, especially the articles in its first section, should definitely be no less a majority.
It&#39;s easy to predict that the president will definitely veto,&quot; Dalia Grybauskaitė&#39;s adviser on domestic policy told Žinia radio on Tuesday.
He emphasized that the first section of the Constitution defines the basic subjects of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty, therefore, if the necessary number of votes to change these articles is reduced, according to M. Lingė, a &quot;negative precedent&quot; would be created and &quot;unmanageable risks would open up&quot;.
&quot;In the president&#39;s opinion, there is no need for any artificial facilitation, it is more necessary to prepare for the referendum itself, we need more dialogue with the people,&quot; he assured.
The Seimas plans to vote on the adoption of the amendment to the Referendum Law on Tuesday.
It stipulates that the decision on amendments to the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution, which has higher protection, is adopted if at least two-fifths of citizens with the right to vote approve it during a referendum.
Currently, the articles of the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution can be changed by referendum by more than half of all citizens with the right to vote.
Approximately 2.5 million people in Lithuania have the right to vote. citizens: half would be 1.25 million voters, two-fifths of a million voters.
This proposal was born after the Seimas approved the President&#39;s veto in September on the amendments previously adopted by the Parliament, which eased the requirements regarding the number of votes when changing citizenship, Article 12 of the first section of the Constitution.
It is proposed to lower the bar for the referendum in preparation for the referendum on dual citizenship, which should take place on May 12 and May 26 next year, when the first and second rounds of the presidential election are planned.
Those who emigrated after the restoration of independence on March 11, 1990, currently, with some exceptions, cannot hold dual citizenship.
Dual citizenship is sought by the world&#39;s Lithuanian community, but they are afraid that the referendum will not take place under the current conditions - a sufficient number of people will not come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports are &quot;strawberry&quot;, so they need to be renovated
The infrastructure of Lithuanian airports and roads is starting to deteriorate, so it is necessary to update it, says Minister of Transport Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renewal of the Vilnius airport is a minimum task that the state must perform.
&quot;The air transport infrastructure is already in shambles because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renovate the Vilnius airport - this is not even part of long-term planning, this is the minimum we must do,&quot; Mr. Masiulis said at the transport conference organized by the Democracy Development Fund and Valstybė magazine on Tuesday.
According to the minister, the next decade will be extremely important, because important projects will have to be implemented - the construction of &quot;Via Baltica&quot;, &quot;Rail Baltica&quot; has been completed, Klaipėda&#39;s outer port has been built, Vilnius and Kaunas airports have been renovated, and perhaps a new airport has been built.
&quot;The next decade will be very important - we have to complete the integration of roads and railways, the construction of the outer port in Klaipėda, fix the airports, maybe decide on the construction of the new airport.
We have to stay awake, start projects now that will use our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years,&quot; said the Minister of Communications.
Mr. Masiulis repeated that too few funds have been allocated to road maintenance in recent years.
&quot;The condition of the roads is not improving yet, because the funds are not allocated enough.
We manage to build new roads, but even for the most necessary maintenance, for example on the trunk roads, there is a lack of funds.
We must determine the amount that should be allocated for road maintenance, if we want their condition to improve,&quot; said Mr. Masiulis.
He emphasized that the export of Lithuanian transport sector services grew by 18.6% this year, and Germany became the largest export market, overtaking Russia.
Mr. Masiulis once again criticized the proposal of the European Commission, according to which the carriers of EU countries will be obliged to periodically return the tractors to the country of registration.
&quot;We must strive to make our exporters feel at home in Western Europe.
In my opinion, it is absurd to suggest that trucks should always return home, because empty trucks would be driving in Europe, burning fuel and increasing emissions.
Railways will benefit the most from this, as costs will increase to the extent that some transport will shift to railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions,&quot; said Mr. Masiulis.
According to the data of the Ministry of Transport, 12.2% is created in the transport sector.
of Lithuania&#39;s gross domestic product (GDP).
More than 118,000 employees work in it, and more than 7,500 companies operate there.
A dispute with heritage guardians
Last week Mr. Masiulis announced in the Seimas Economic Committee that he had started negotiations on changing the cultural purpose of the Vilnius airport building - this would allow demolishing the old terminal and building a new one.
However, the temporary head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD), Mr. Algimantas Degutis. Masiulis called the deliberations political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the 1950s is a value entered in the register in 1993, and not politicians, but specialists should decide on its deletion.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that a modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving the image of Lithuania.
&quot;Removing the old terminal from heritage would be a politically important step, so that it can be demolished and a new, modern arrival terminal can be built, so that when you fly to Vilnius, you will feel like you are in a modern country, and not in such an interesting country, which really does not represent our country as an innovative one&quot;, - he said in the Seimas last week Mr. Massiuli.
Mr. Masiulis then also announced that it is planned to build a completely new passenger terminal in Kaunas and to connect the airport with the &quot;Rail Baltica&quot; track by building an underground station.
This transport node should be operational in 2026, after the completion of the construction of &quot;Rail Baltica&quot;.
Last year, Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million passengers. people, 4.8 million are expected this year. passengers, and next year - 5 million.
Kaunas Airport served a total of 1.2 million passengers last year. passengers.

Minister of Finance on the possible crisis: it is important not to talk about illness
&quot;We always have to prepare for more difficult times.
What I want to celebrate is that for the third year in a row, for the first time in the history of Lithuania, we are accumulating reserves.
But it&#39;s also very important not to talk about the illness,&quot; V. Šapoka said during his visit to Brussels on Monday.
ELTA reminds that on Monday and Tuesday the Minister of Finance and Deputy Minister Miglė Tuskienė is participating in the meetings of the Eurogroup and the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
ECOFIN meeting discusses issues related to taxation of digital services.
This new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU&#39;s single market, as some member states have already introduced or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to agree on how the income received for the provision of certain digital services should be taxed in the EU member states until there is a consensus at global level.
The euro group will review the draft budgets of the eurozone countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On October 23, the EC rejected Italy&#39;s draft budget as not meeting the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the EC has taken advantage of this opportunity.
More information was requested from Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss the issues of deepening the Economic and Monetary Union: the implementation possibilities of the European deposit insurance system and the reforms of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role of the ESM in financial support programs, but it is believed that the functions of the ESM must be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of the functions of the ESM and other EU institutions.
Balys Burach.
Lithuanian work traditions and customs
Recently, it was 120 years since the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural chronicler, ethnographer and local researcher Balis Buračs (1897-1972) in Sidarii, Šiaulėnai county, then Šiauliai Governorate.
Commemorating the 100th anniversary of the state of Lithuania, we have a great opportunity to remember how the vibrant national revival called many Lithuanian people, among them the Burač brothers - Bali, Jonas, Bronių - from the depths of the village to get involved with all their creative powers in nurturing, giving meaning to and preserving our cultural traditions. .
Balys Buračas, who traveled around his native land with a camera in his hands for more than 50 years, presented a wide and realistic picture of the customs, traditions, folk art and material culture of our country.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing layers of national culture and had a rare ability to realize the lasting value of the work he was doing.
In the photographs of Balis Buračs, the landscape of Lithuania, mounds, our people in national costumes, immortalized in the environment of everyday life and holidays, decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines.
This publication presents a significant part of Bali&#39;s Burach legacy, devoted to the description of national work customs and related traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The published material shows not only the uniqueness and beauty of those traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite two world wars and heavy occupation.
The manuscript of the book is extremely rich in descriptions of the works, festivals and other traditions and customs of the inhabitants of Žemaitija, especially the Kupiškės, Šiauliės, Telšiškis, as well as Aukštaitija and Dzūkija residents, written by Balis Buračs.
From the approximately 10,000 negatives preserved in museums and archives, over 400 rare, mostly hitherto unpublished photographs have been selected for this publication, which are grouped according to the selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture, characteristic of the Kupiškės, Dzuks, and other districts of Aukštaitija and Žemaitija.

The tragic fate of the couple: they died just a few hours after their marriage
A newlywed couple who got married just a few hours earlier died in a helicopter crash in the southwest of the US state of Texas.
William Troy Byler, 24, and his co-wife, Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler, were killed shortly after midnight Sunday when the helicopter crashed into a hill 10 miles northwest of Juvaldi and 75 miles west of San Antonio, said Justice of the Peace Steven Kennedy.
The strange thing is that the accident happened after flying about 24 kilometers, exactly how old the newlyweds were.
The helicopter pilot, Gerald Douglas Lawrence, 76, was also killed.
The newlyweds studied at Sam Houston State University, located in Huntsville, Texas.
They got married on Saturday evening at the Byler family ranch near Juvaldi and flew off in the family&#39;s helicopter after the wedding ceremony.
The accident occurred after the helicopter had flown approximately 24 kilometers.
The newlyweds flew to San Antonio International Airport, where they planned to board a plane for their honeymoon, Kennedy said, without specifying the couple&#39;s final destination.
&quot;It&#39;s a very rocky, rugged area, and that hill is about 120-150 meters high,&quot; Kennedy said.
GD Lawrence flew that family of aircraft for many years.
According to Mr. Kennedy, he also flew helicopters while serving in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, it should become clear what the pilot&#39;s physical condition was and whether it could have been the cause of the crash.
The helicopter crashed approximately 5-10 minutes after takeoff.
Its wreckage jutted out wide onto the rocky hillside, leaving the fuselage &quot;dangerously suspended,&quot; aviation safety investigator Craig Hatch of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said at a news conference Monday.
Investigators intend to haul away the wreckage and then take a closer look at it, but it will not be easy for a tow truck and a truck to reach the area, he said.
The cause of the crash has not yet been determined, and the NTSB&#39;s preliminary report is expected to be released in two weeks.
Israeli PM calls entry into force of new sanctions on Iran &quot;historic day&quot;
&quot;Today is a historic day,&quot; Netanyahu told lawmakers from his Likud party, his office said.
&quot;Today is the day that under the leadership of President (Donald) Trump (Donald Trump), the United States imposes extremely tough sanctions on Iran, the toughest sanctions on Iran since the beginning of efforts to curb its aggression,&quot; the head of the Israeli government said.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman stated that the new sanctions will deal a &quot;decisive&quot; blow to Israel&#39;s actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls the &quot;toughest sanctions ever,&quot; followed Trump&#39;s controversial decision in May to pull out of the world powers&#39; accord with Tehran over its nuclear program.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran&#39;s oil exports, which have already fallen by about a million barrels a day since May, and cut off Tehran from international financing.
Israel has long opposed the deal with Iran, saying its scope and timeframe are too limited.
The Jewish state also says that the lifting of sanctions has made it possible for Iran to finance militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran&#39;s actions in neighboring Syria and has vowed to prevent it from gaining a foothold there militarily.
The other parties to the Iran deal - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - oppose the US decision and say the deal, as intended, has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The court is again unraveling the circumstances of the death of the young motorcyclist
The court will hear the testimony of a witness in the case of the accident that resulted in the death of a young motorcyclist in the Northern Township of Vilnius.
The Vilnius District Court decided on Tuesday that in order to find out all the significant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses of the case will be questioned at the next hearing on November 26.
An acquittal has already been announced in this case, but the prosecution does not agree with it.
On August 22, the district court of the city of Vilnius acquitted the driver of the car, 79-year-old Eduardas Osipova, in connection with the accident that resulted in the death of the motorcyclist, declaring that the motorcyclist was driving at high speed in the city and committed a serious violation.
Vilnius District Prosecutor&#39;s Office asks the district court to annul the district court&#39;s verdict and claims that E. Osipov is most to blame for the accident, and the district court&#39;s conclusions are unfounded.
The lawyer of the family of the deceased motorcyclist is also requesting the annulment of the acquittal.
The accident happened on August 11, 2015 at around 3 pm, when the Škoda Fabia car driven by E. Osipov entered Žirmūnai street from Lakūnai street and collided with a motorcycle traveling on the main road.
The prosecutor&#39;s office accused the man that the car driver violated the road traffic rules, which stipulate giving way, and caused a traffic accident - a man riding a &quot;Piaggo&quot; motorcycle on the main road was killed.
Initial police reports indicated that the driver of the scooter was killed, but later after investigations, it was determined that the vehicle was comparable in power to a motorcycle.
Vilnius City District Court judge Rolandas Bužinskas told BNS that experts determined that the motorcycle driver was traveling at a speed of 89.2 kilometers per hour, although the speed limit in that area is 50 kilometers per hour.
&quot;The driver of the car could not have foreseen that the motorcycle would travel at such a high speed,&quot; the judge said.
At that time, the driver of the car, who was of a respectable age, claimed that he was driving at a speed of only 5-6 kilometers per hour.
Seeing the obstacle, the motorcycle driver tried to brake and fell off the vehicle before colliding with the Škoda Fabia.
The prosecutor&#39;s office believes that E. Osipov, who was driving from the side road to the main road, should have given way to the motorcyclist.
&quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot;: six &quot;Wagner&quot; mercenaries were killed in Syria
Among the dead are five soldiers of the Syrian military forces and six persons belonging to the military company &quot;Wagner&quot;.
This was announced by a source in &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot; in Syria.
According to the source, one of the units of the 5th Corps of the Syrian Armed Forces is stationed in the mentioned territory, to which a number of Syrian volunteers and &quot;military mercenaries&quot; have joined.
&quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot; sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a request to provide information about the fate of the Russians.
The former king of Belgium will have to take a paternity test
This decision is a partial victory for artist Delphine Boel.
Since 2013, she has been seeking to be recognized as the child of the former monarch.
The 50-year-old claims that her mother Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II had a brief love affair decades ago.
The 84-year-old former king denies paternity.
According to station RTBF, he may appeal to the Supreme Court against the DNA test.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boel - Delphine&#39;s mother&#39;s ex-husband - is neither the biological nor legal father of the artist.
Delphinė applied for the relevant investigation so that she could be recognized as the daughter of &quot;real&quot; father Albert.
The CEC will distribute money to parties, but will not give anything to social workers
The Central Election Commission (CEC) is going to distribute almost 3 million to the biggest political parties this week. A budget grant amounting to EUR.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labor Party (LSDDP), which was established in the spring of this year and is led by the vice-speaker of the parliament Gediminas Kirkilas, has not yet been allocated funds from the budget.
But they can be allocated in the near future by a separate decision of the CEC, if the legal environment regulating the distribution of grants to parties changes.
Laura Matjošaityte, the chairwoman of the CEC, informed VŽ that &quot;a commission meeting is scheduled for this Thursday, where a decision is planned to be taken on the allocation of the budget half-yearly grant to the parties&quot;.
According to her, the CEC must make a decision on this issue by November 15.
2.751 million is expected to be distributed to seven parties, six of which are parliamentary. Eur.
The opposition Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive more than 0.66 million. EUR, for the ruling Union of Peasants and Greens - about 0.55 million. EUR, for the opposition Social Democratic Party - about 0.5 million. EUR, for the opposition Liberal movement - almost 0.4 million. EUR, for the Labor Party, which does not have its own faction in the Seimas - about 0.23 million. EUR, for the Party of Order and Justice, which recently joined the ruling party - almost 0.22 million. EUR, about 0.18 mln. Eur.
According to the current law, which will be followed by the CEC when distributing budget money, grants are awarded to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last Seimas, municipal councils and European Parliament elections.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow the LSDDP, which was established only this spring, to expect to receive money from the budget.
Because this party has not yet participated in any elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers receive at least a couple of hundred thousand euros in the run-up to three elections - local government, presidential and European Parliament - that will be held next year.
The corresponding amendments to the Political Parties and this year&#39;s budget laws adopted by the Seimas were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but representatives of the ruling party, Mr. Kirkilas and the leader of the peasants-greens, Ramūnas Karbauskis, assure that the parliamentarians will seek to reject the objections of the president.

Poroshenko: those who ordered the murder of activist Handziuk must be punished
&quot;I want to state that no version - and there are more than 20 of them today - will not be rejected.
Each will be checked very carefully in accordance with investigative procedures.
As president, I have no opportunity and no obligation to obtain information that could harm the course of the investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency, and law enforcement institutions must work efficiently.
Only in this way will it be possible to find out the truth and punish evil&quot;, said P. Poroshenko at a meeting with young people on Tuesday in Kyiv.
He emphasized that he is most interested in K. Handziuk&#39;s murder being solved, and that the killers, organizers of the crime and those who ordered it &quot;should take the necessary responsibility&quot;.

There is simply no other way for us.&quot;

Bill Gates introduced a waterless toilet
When presenting the futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the transition from traditional such devices to plumbing-free to the computer revolution of the 1970s.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates unveiled a high-tech toilet at an exhibition in Beijing that does not require water in plumbing pipes, Reuters reported.
The toilet without water works according to the principle of separating solid and liquid waste.
Both types of wastewater are processed into chemical fertilizers.
&quot;The technologies you see here are the greatest advances in sanitation in the last 200 years,&quot; Bill Gates was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.
The technological toilet was created with the funds of a charity foundation established by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
During seven years of work on a device that could turn human waste into fertilizer or water, the foundation spent $200 million on it.
In total, according to Bill Gates, about 20 toilet models were created.
The unit is now complete and ready for sale.
However, in order for such toilets to be mass-produced, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500,000 children under the age of five die every year due to poor sanitation.
Fighting problems caused by poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, increases health spending, which already stands at 233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitation situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates put a jar of feces in the toilet presentation.
It&#39;s a good reminder, he said, that a small sample &quot;may contain 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200,000 bacteria that cause infectious diseases, 100,000 worm parasite eggs.&quot;

Chubby girls are breaking stereotypes about wedding dresses
Chubby girl in a white puffy wedding dress - mission (not) possible?
Can an altar white swan be bigger than S or M and still look attractive?
The participants of the plus-size reality show &quot;Size (r) evolution&quot; will already prove today that the beauty and elegance of a bride really does not depend on a woman&#39;s kilograms.
But that&#39;s not all - one of the project&#39;s girls will shed tears of happiness tonight - her boyfriend will appear on the set.
&quot;There are still those who think that bigger girls don&#39;t get attention or looks from guys.
It&#39;s just a myth - my boyfriend is an athlete himself, but he likes me the way I am, he doesn&#39;t expect me to have a figure that meets some standards&quot;, - before the performance in a wedding dress, show participant Aurika will speak.
A wedding dress is not light, in every sense, the garment is a complex construction, it contains a lot of material, the dress is heavy, inconvenient to move.
Also, some women think that a bigger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and therefore less confident.
I can reassure you that a properly selected dress model really solves this &quot;problem&quot;, - explained one of the members of the show&#39;s commission, fashion designer Robert Kalinkin.
The fate of the girls in the project is decided by R. Kalinkinas together with the entire commission - Erika Vitulskiene, who opened a plus-size fashion house, photographer and social media star Naglius Bieranc and TV producer Laura Paukšte.
&quot;When deciding which girl has to say goodbye to the show, a lot of quarrels arise between the commission members - after all, we all represent different spheres and have different ideas about the winner of the show.
The task of displaying wedding dresses was made even more difficult by the fact - I can reveal now - that two newcomers appeared, who were certainly no worse than the old ones.
It was a special evening in every sense,&quot; says R. Kalinkinas.
Newcomers - 23 years old. Ieva, who became famous for her scandalous behavior in a summer reality show, and 31-year-old exceptionally beautiful mother of two children Dovilė - like other girls participated in the selection of &quot;Size (r) evolution&quot; and entered the top twenty.
Unfortunately, after the girls&#39; first extremely open photo session on the streets of Vilnius, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girls were returned to the show by LNK viewers who voted for their favorites on the TV portal.
The internationally recognized reality show of chubby beauties is taking place in Lithuania for the second week already - plus-size girls are competing for the name of the country&#39;s first plus-size star.
So far, only eight of them remain - and they all understand very well that there can only be one winner.
The intriguing and unpredictable week of the reality show &quot;Size (r) evolution&quot; starts already this Monday evening at 8:30 p.m. through LNK.

He became the 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
Although the man says that the news was unexpected, he did not lack wit when talking about the new title.
I thought &quot;It can&#39;t be!
Seriously?&quot;.
Then I looked at myself in the mirror and thought - yes, today I look sexy, - the actor shared with a laugh.
Speaking candidly, Idris described the title as an extremely pleasant feeling that stroked his ego.
The British star claims that he often received abusive words and bullying, which made his childhood difficult, because, as he says, he was &quot;very tall and clumsy&quot;.
The young actor was not liked by his peers and became the object of bullying because of his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
&quot;As soon as I grew a mustache and muscles, I became the toughest guy in my neighborhood,&quot; smiles Idris.
When her husband doesn&#39;t have to be big on the screens, I. Elba works as a disc jockey at parties organized in Spain, especially in the bustling Ibiza.
In his spare time, the man enjoys Thai boxing and has a flair for fashion, which he realizes by creating his own clothing line.

I. Elba became the 33rd sexiest man in the world chosen by &quot;People&quot; magazine.

According to the data of the Vilnius County Police, at 9:16 p.m. a report was received that a man had beaten a neighbor during a drinking spree.
When the medics arrived, they confirmed the death of a man born in 1943.

The authorities no longer require a distance of 20 km when building waste incineration plants
Vilnius cogeneration power plant is under construction, near the Gariūnai market.
The authorities no longer aim to maintain a distance of 20 kilometers from settlements when building waste incineration plants.
On Monday, the head of the Environmental Protection Committee, &quot;citizen&quot; Kęstutis Mažeika, registered an amendment to the Law on Waste Management in the Seimas, in which he refuses such a requirement.
According to Mr. Mazeika, the &quot;peasant&quot; faction, which previously supported the provision regarding the 20 km distance, promises to support the amendment regarding its rejection.
Mr. Mazeika&#39;s amendment provides that from January 2019, waste incineration power plants could be built in accordance with the environmental protection and public health protection requirements set by law.
He admits that the amendments were prompted by the president&#39;s doubts about such a ban.
&quot;Taking into account the definition of the residential area, it is obvious that it would be almost impossible to find such a place where the above-mentioned objects could be built,&quot; says the chairman of the committee.
In October, the ruling majority resisted the president&#39;s veto of amendments that would tighten the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the ban on building waste incineration power plants closer than 20 km from settlements, the amendments provided for permission for the Government to make decisions on the future of the two power plants already under construction, taking into account the interests of public health.
The latter provisions p. Mažeika does not offer to adjust.
The waste and biofuel-fired power plant is being built in Vilnius by the energy group Lietuvos Energija, and in Kaunas together with Fortum Heat Lietuva, a company of the Finnish energy concern Fortum.
The latter already burns waste in Klaipėda.
It is about a possible compromise in the Brexit negotiations
The leaders of Britain and Ireland on Monday discussed a possible compromise on the thorny issue of Northern Ireland that is stalling Brexit negotiations, Dublin said.
Speaking by phone, British Prime Minister Theresa May suggested a review of the so-called safeguards agreement mechanism, which would allow the border between the United Kingdom&#39;s Northern Ireland province and the European Union&#39;s Republic of Ireland to remain open.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar promised to consider the proposal but ruled out any possibility of Britain unilaterally withdrawing from the deal, the Irish government said in a statement.
In the conversation Th. May &quot;raised the possibility of a review of the hedging mechanism,&quot; it said.
&quot;Varadkar has made it clear that he is open to reviewing new proposals, provided the outcome of such a review does not involve a unilateral decision to end the hedging measures,&quot; the government said in a statement.
Brexit negotiators have failed to find an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the UK-Ireland land border when Britain leaves the single market and customs union in March next year.
The two countries are agreeing on &quot;precautionary measures&quot; to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a larger trade deal is signed to ensure no additional customs checks are carried out at the border.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to follow EU customs rules, but London wants them to apply temporarily to the whole of the United Kingdom.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is pushing for Britain to be able to withdraw from the safeguards agreement unilaterally after three months.
However, L. Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government &quot;cannot support this&quot;.
&quot;Three-month or limited-term hedges are not worth the paper they&#39;re written on,&quot; he said.
Earlier, London and Brussels did not confirm information about a breakthrough in the Brexit negotiations after a report appeared in Britain over the weekend that an agreement was within reach.
&quot;I would say that we continue to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work to be done,&quot; said Th. May&#39;s representative in London.
European Commission representative Margaritis Schinas also told reporters: &quot;We are not there yet.&quot;
Nobel laureates call for access to reliable information
A group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel laureates, issued a declaration on Monday calling for the right to reliable information in the Internet age.
Among the 25 signatories to the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, as well as Nobel Prize for Literature laureate writer Mario Vargas Llosa (Marijs Vargas Liosa).
&quot;We call on leaders of good will on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debate through which citizens can make decisions based on facts,&quot; the group said in a statement.
They argue that the &quot;global space of information and communication&quot; is a common good that &quot;must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and opinion&quot;.
&quot;People have a fundamental right to receive information that is freely collected, processed and disseminated, based on a commitment to the truth, the principles of pluralism and rational methods of fact-finding,&quot; added the authors of the declaration.
The document asks for help from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, who often criticizes &quot;fake news&quot; but is regularly accused of distorting the facts.
World leaders should express their position on this issue when they gather at the &quot;Peace Forum&quot; to be held in Paris on November 11-13, the signatories urged.
This declaration was prepared in two months under the guidance of Sh. Ebadi and Christophe Deloire, head of Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a media freedom and journalists&#39; rights organization based in Paris.
Other signatories include former Senegalese president Abdou Diouf, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and political scientist Francis Fukuyama.
The Seimas approved higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved the amendments to the Law on Product Safety, which stipulate that fines for product safety violations must be increased.
The amendments were approved unanimously in the meeting room.
As the member of the Seimas Health Affairs Committee Antanas Vinkus said, when it comes to the new project, it is welcome that the goals set are related to better protection of product consumers.
In addition, its provisions are adapted to the requirements of the decision of the European Parliament and the Council.
&quot;In my opinion, the proposed draft law is better and more specifically distributed to all actors involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the currently valid system of fines does not always prevent further violations, because entities that have paid fines continue to commit repeated violations,&quot; said A. Vinkus.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, after the approval of the Government, the Economic Committee of the Seimas supplemented it with its proposals.
The amendments to the law aim to increase the fines for violations, strengthen the protection of consumer rights, give more powers to the market surveillance authorities and create a clear system of supervision of product safety requirements and their compliance.
According to the Ministry of Economy, there is currently no obligation for manufacturers to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
In addition, according to the ministry, the market surveillance authorities are not given the right to enter the territory, buildings, premises of producers and suppliers, and to carry out inspections, which complicates the work of the authorities.
According to the Ministry&#39;s assessment, the six-month deadline for issuing fines and warnings is too short to detect a violation, conduct an investigation and impose a fine.
Also, according to the ministry, the imposed fines are not effective enough.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law - 14 companies did so in 2017 alone.
The Ministry of Economy proposed to impose on manufacturers the obligation to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability, so that it would be easier for the market surveillance authorities to clarify the suppliers of products that do not meet the requirements.
It is also proposed to give the market surveillance authorities the right to enter the territory, buildings, premises of economic entities that manufacture and supply products to the market, and carry out inspections, in the course of state product safety control.
It is intended to increase the fines for violations of the law.
A fine of between 150 and 2,500 (now between 144 and 1,448) euros would be imposed on the manufacturer, importer or authorized representative who presented dangerous products to the market, and the distributor, who supplied them to the market, or the service provider who provided or provided dangerous services.
If the State Consumer Rights Protection Service (VVTAT) or another market surveillance authority decides to prohibit the presentation and supply of dangerous products to the market or the provision of dangerous services, a fine of 1,000 to 5,000 (now 868 to 4,344) euros would be imposed.
Failure to comply with the requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, recover them from consumers and destroy them would result in a fine of 2,500 to 6,500 (now 1,448 to 5,792) euros.
If dangerous products caused damage to the health of the consumer, a fine of 2,500 to 15,000 (now 1,448 to 11,584) euros would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused the death of the user, a fine of between 6,500 and 25,000 (now between 5,792 and 23,169) euros would be imposed.
According to the Ministry&#39;s data, up to 25,000 fines are awarded in Poland and Austria for violation of legal acts regulating product safety. EUR fine (the minimum amount of the fine has not been determined), in Belgium - from EUR 26 to EUR 600,000. EUR fine, in Romania - from EUR 155 to EUR 6,666 fine, in Bulgaria - from EUR 125 to EUR 7,500 fine.

Norwegian armed battalion participated in NATO exercises in the most remote and harsh areas
Soldiers from the Norwegian Armed Forces took part in a series of challenging exercises in the mountains north of the country&#39;s capital, Oslo.
This is part of the NATO exercise &quot;Triangle 2018&quot; - the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the soldiers from the second battalion of the Norwegian military have spent a lot of time away from home in places like Afghanistan - that is, in warm countries - after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
But they are most adept at warfare in Arctic conditions, and these skills are especially useful now that NATO is shifting its focus.
In recent days, in the mountains east of Tinsett, often in the most remote and rugged terrain, soldiers have engaged in staged battles against real British soldiers.
Soldiers have the skills to survive in this cold wilderness, but in the harsh climate, they have to carry much more weight on their shoulders - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
Soldiers staying at the command post say they share their survival and warfare skills with other NATO soldiers.
According to the soldiers, this exercise, which resembles real warfare like no other, will teach them to be ready in case of a serious threat.

After retiring, the vice mayor of Kaunas does not plan to return to politics
The former vice mayor of Kaunas, Povilas Mačiulis, who left his job in the municipality and the &quot;Vieninga Kaunas&quot; organization due to his support for Vygaud Ušackis in the presidential elections, does not plan to return to politics and promises to focus on business.
&quot;I&#39;m going to concentrate on business.
I am a shareholder in several companies and also have ideas for new projects.
And the most important thing is that I will be able to enjoy the opportunity to spend more time with my family,&quot; P. Mačiulis told BNS.
He also said that he does not plan to participate in the upcoming municipal elections.
Mr. Mačiulis has not yet had a chance to talk to V. Ušacks after he lost the primary elections of the Union of Fatherland-Lithuanian Christian Democrats to Ingrida Šimonyta on Sunday.
&quot;To be honest, we haven&#39;t had time to discuss the results in detail with him and the team and talk about future plans.
It is clear that after Vygaudus withdraws from the further election campaign, this phase of my life is over,&quot; said P. Mačiulis.
He said that he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas politics due to support for V. Ušacki, he only regretted that &quot;Lithuania lost a unique opportunity to have a real leader in the context of international relations&quot;.
Mr. Mačiulis worked as the deputy mayor of Kaunas for a short time in 2011, and later returned to this position after the successful elections of &quot;Vieningam Kaunai&quot; in 2015.

Workers are at work in Kaunas Castle: what are they doing here?
The people of Kaunas, who noticed the workers working in the Kaunas Castle, hoped that the reconstruction of the surviving tower was finally underway.
Gabrielius Suziedėlis, the director of the Kaunas City Museum, told the portal kauno.diena.lt that the work of replacing the cover of the protective canopies of the southwestern tower with a fragment of the defensive wall is underway.
According to the interviewer, the canopies will be tins.
&quot;The tin cover, which was worn out in an emergency condition, posed a threat to those around - people could fall and get injured - so it was necessary to replace it.
The roofs were no longer resistant to moisture, so the heritage was also harmed,&quot; explained the director of the museum.
Will these canopies be similar to those of a few centuries ago?
&quot;All the works are coordinated with the heritage and other institutions&quot;, G. Zužeidelis added, striving to make the result as authentic as possible, but at the same time, the practical side is also important - the canopies must protect the valuables from moisture.
When working with heritage, a universal solution is chosen.
Before that, the elements of the Kaunas Castle were covered with tin back in the Soviet era, so they no longer had historical value,&quot; the director of the Kaunas City Museum detailed.
The employment contract was signed on October 2.
It is planned that the works will not last longer than three months from the signing of the contract.
&quot;It is expected that it will be finished by the end of November&quot;, - the director of the museum explained the expectations.
According to him, the value of the works is almost 24 thousand. Eur.
According to the interviewer, this amount was provided for in this year&#39;s budget.
The company &quot;Statija&quot; is carrying out the works in Kaunas Castle.
Kaunas. diena.lt has written how, according to the conducted research, Kaunas Castle could have looked like before.

The Center for Eastern European Studies will cooperate with two prominent US &quot;think tanks&quot;
According to Linas Kojalas, head of RESC, which is based in Vilnius and has already been operating for thirteen years, networking in the USA will allow projects to be implemented and make Lithuania&#39;s voice more audible on the other side of the Atlantic.
&quot;We have been working purposefully in this direction for several months.
I am glad that two large institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that there will be niches for activities, because the topics we analyze - NATO, security, disinformation, and the development of the Eastern Partnership countries - are also a priority for them,&quot; said Kojala.
In the agreements, it is noted that RESC and US institutions will work together in the preparation of international project applications, expert experience and knowledge will be exchanged, expert visits will be organized.
This should be particularly useful for Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have an excellent international reputation.
FPRI has been operating since 1955 and unites almost a hundred top-level analysts.
In the latest global ranking of think tanks by the University of Pennsylvania, FPRI ranked seventh in its category.
At that time, CEPA, whose analysts were repeatedly invited to consult and work in the highest political institutions of the United States, ranked tenth in its category in the same ranking.
&quot;This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to break into the US information space and encourage us to raise the bar of quality,&quot; added Kojala.
One of the first practical steps should be the help of partners in distributing RESC&#39;s soon-to-be published analytical publication &quot;Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review&quot; among US decision-makers and in the public space.
The Center for Eastern European Studies operates on the basis of implemented projects and is not supported by targeted grants.
RESC&#39;s partners with whom joint initiatives are implemented include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international foundations, etc.

He was a military intelligence officer at the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but had to return to work as mayor in January.
Another member of the US military, whose name has not yet been released, was wounded in the attack that killed Taylor on Saturday.
Taylor died from small arms fire, officials said.
Maj. Gen. Jefferson S. Burton, commander of the Utah National Guard, told reporters that Mr. Taylor helped train and strengthen the capabilities of the Afghan National Army.
Utah media cited NATO as saying Mr. Taylor was shot by one of its trained special forces soldiers and that the gunman was killed by Afghan forces.
Mr. Taylor had a wife and seven children.
His remains are expected to be flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Monday evening.
He had previously served two tours of duty in Iraq, and this was his second tour of duty in Afghanistan.
In January, before he left for Afghanistan, Taylor told local media that he had been assigned to a team of advisers and trainers for a special forces battalion in that country.
At that time, hundreds of residents of North Ogden gathered about 17 thousand. to see off the streets of the populous city with the police escorted procession of their mayor, who rode with his family.
B. Taylor became the mayor of the city in 2013.
