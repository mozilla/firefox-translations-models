Stars emit light and heat, because by connecting (suching) hydrogen atoms to make the harder elements, energy is generated.
Scientists are seeking to create a reactor capable of producing energy in the same way.
However, however, this is a very difficult problem to solve, and the useful reactor of synthesis of synthesis will be built only after many years.
The steel needle floats due to the surface of the water surface due to the surface tension.
The surface tension occurs because the water molecules on the surface of the water on the water surface attract each other much more than the air molecule present.
The water molecule of water molecules forms an invisible film, which can lead to the flow of the needle on the surface of the water.
The blades of the modern skateboard have two edges, among which is a concave indentation. Two edges allow you to get into the ice even inclined.
Since the bottom of the blades are slightly curved, the blade is inclined to one side or the other side, the edge that touches the ice also bends.
This allows the skater to make a turn. If the skates are tilted to the right, the skater turns to the right, and if the skate is tilted to the left, the skater turns to the left.
In order to return the previous energy level, they need to get rid of the extra energy that came from the light.
They do this by emitting a small part of light, called a photon.
Scientists call this process of “forcer-indiversible light”, because the bright light stimulates the atoms, which makes the lights emit and the light is the type of radiation.
The other picture depicts photonese-reducing atoms. In reality, photons are much lower than in the picture.
Photons are smaller than particles that make up the atoms!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the incandescent bulb thread finally burns and the bulb no longer works.
The bulb should then be changed. Changes should be made with caution.
First you need to turn off the luminaire switch or disconnect the wire.

Some scientists believe that triceratopses have eaten cyons – plants that were common during the chalk period.
These plants resemble a small palm tree with a crown of sharp, spicy leaves.
Perhaps triceratops used its powerful spout to pick up all the leaves before eating a trunk.
Other scientists argue that these plants are very poisonous, so it is unlikely that any dinosaur has eaten them, although today the lazy and other animals, such as the parrot (the descendant of the dinosaurs), can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
What force would I be attracted to Ioo gravity? If you stand on the surface of Io, you would weigh less than on Earth.
Person weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth, Io leveraged about 36 pounds (16 kg). So the gravity, of course, attracts you less.
The sun has no crust on which you can stand like on Earth. The entire Sun is made of gases, fire and plasma.

Interactive design requires the project components to be connected to each other, but have a meaning and as individual entities.
The lack of objective-changing visually altering the lens is that much more of the main lenses of the focus and the number of lenses required to reach the range of focal lengths is much more.
This problem is declining as producers of lenses reach higher standards of lens production.
This allowed, using a zoomwork, to take photos, the quality of which is equivalent to the quality obtained using the fixed focus distance lens.
Another lack of an object with an optical enhancement function is that the maximum aperture (speed) of this lens is usually lower.
Therefore, inexpensive zoom lenses, it is difficult to use without a flash in poor lighting conditions.
One of the most common problems in trying to convert the film into a DVD format is that the image extends beyond the display of the screen.

The disorder of attention deficits “is a neurological syndrome, defined by three classic symptoms: impulsivity, distraction and hyperactivity or excess energy”.
It is not a disorder of development, it is a learning disorder, “from which 3–5 per cent of all children, perhaps even 2 million American children.”
For children who have been subject to an activity-diffusty and attention disorder, it is difficult to focus on things such as learning, but they can focus on what they like, for example, playing games, watching cartoons or writing sentences without punctuation marks.
These children can cause a lot of problems, because they “is risky, beat and resist officials” in order to stimulate their brain, because it fails in normal ways.

The human palm is shorter than the foot, the palm of the fingers are straightforward.
This shift in the specialization of the hand from the proliferation of the hand from the moulding to manipulation is revealed by the bones of 2-3 million years of age.
Some people think that many and often artificially caused conscious dreams can be very troubled.
The main cause of this phenomenon is the result of clear dreams that prolong the phases of time between the phases of restless sleep (REM).
When there are fewer REM phases at night, this state, when you actually sleep and the body recovers, it becomes quite rare and it causes problems.
It botheres as if you wereating every twenty or thirty minutes and watching TV.

Tourists can visit various places of destination in a particular country or can simply focus on one area.
Seeing such activities, the colonists also focused on reinforcement.
The 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments, led by the Confederists of John Stark and James Reed (both later became generals).
Stark's men took positions along the fence at the northern end of the colonists' positions.
When, due to the tide, the gap appeared along the mysterious river along the mysterious river in the north and east of the north, they quickly extended the fence with a short stone wall to the northern end, ending at the water limit on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark built a pole about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and indicated that no one would keep up until the troops crossed that limit.
The American plan was based on coordinated attacks from three different directions.
Gen. John Cadwalder launched a fraudulent attack in Bordendown before the British crew in Bordendown to prevent the reinforcement.
General James Ewing transferred 700 reserve members of the army through the river Trenton Ferry in the river Trenton Ferry, seized a bridge over the Assunpink stream and prevented the enemy from escaping the army.
