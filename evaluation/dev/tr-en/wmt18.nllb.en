Last minute: Kozmik Ziyaretçimiz Dev Asteroit 2014 JO25 is the first of its kind.
There are billions, perhaps even more, of dev galaxies in the Güneş System that could cause serious consequences if they crash and crash.
From its formation, the Sun can pass through the Earth through the path of these orbiting bodies, which are either closed or open.
Asteroid 2014 JO25 with a diameter of 650 meters will pass through a distance of 1.75 million kilometers from Earth, which is close to its location, and such a visitor will pass today at 14:24 hours.
Such news is more frequently reported in the media.
This is largely due to developments in observation techniques and observation tools.
This way we could identify smaller asteroids that we had previously identified.
For example, last January, an asteroid the size of a bus had passed just half the Earth's and Moon's distance (~250,000 km) from Earth.
And the most recent asteroid to pass through was identified just a few days ago.
So there could be another space shuttle that's coming up.
Imagine if you were told that an asteroid 20 meters in diameter would fall right in the middle of the galaxy where you were found?
In fact, this boyuttaki asteroid will not destroy the mahalenizi, or it will probably blow up the cameras of all the stars.
This will be due to shock waves emitted by asteroids that will penetrate the atmosphere.
For example, in 2013 an asteroid that crashed into Russia was a boycott and it was enough to tear apart the windows of several city halls.
However, if you have an asteroid 100 meters in diameter that is targeting you, you should go at least 50 kilometers beyond it.
Criteria such as asteroid size and angle of impact are determined by the depth of the crater and the damage caused by the impact.
According to a simulation by the European Space Agency, let's look at a few scenarios.
If an asteroid with a diameter of 100 m and an angle of 45 degrees with a velocity of 60 km/s were to cross the Earth at a depth of about 250 meters and a crater with a diameter of 1200 meters would form.
According to the Çarpma Richter scale, a six-degree earthquake is equivalent to a six-degree earthquake, and even if you are 10 kilometers away from the point of impact, your body will burn to 3 degrees.
50 km of road will be paved with broken glass cameras.
If an asteroid with a diameter of 1 km hits the Earth, it will become more stable.
With the same angle and velocity, such an asteroid will strike Earth at a depth of about 600 meters and form a crater 12 km across.
So the coca is a semttr crater that is transformed and disappears instantly.
Even if you are 100 km away from the impact point due to the heat of the impact, your body will burn 3 degrees.
According to the Çarpma Richter scale, 8 is the equivalent of a depremise in magnitude.
The damage caused by the asteroid depends not only on the asteroid's chemical composition but also on the structure of the area it will hit.
The above values serve to serve as a backdrop for the scenario that emerged when a region of asteroid formation collapsed.
If the asteroid falls on a surface mostly made of iron, a crater size of 3 times larger will increase and the resulting catastrophe will be catastrophic.
66 million years ago, something better happened to the dinosaurs, and they were hit by a massive asteroid about 10 km across.
As a result of the asteroid impact, 75 percent of marine and land life was wiped out immediately.
If dinosaurs were to destroy an asteroid of this size, targeting Earth would be a sure and sound option to leave the planet.
The Earth is dropping tons of matter from space every day.
Most of these are burned and cooled in the atmosphere.
Some of the massive galaxies in the atmosphere are becoming more and more massive, causing what is known as the star cluster among the general public.
Let us write our own words in a more relaxed way.
Studies show that over the next 300-400 years, an asteroid with a sizeable impact that could cause very serious destruction is not expected to hit Earth.
As living organisms that live an average of 70 years, at least one of you has had some comfort.
The flash claim for the Medal: 10 million euros!
Gary Medel, who was determined to break away from the name Inter'trden, which was on the agenda of the Siyah-Beyaz people who wanted to strengthen the Stoper region...
The 30-year-old, who left the Confederations Cup squad in Chile and recently returned to Inter'le, is looking forward to the offers.
Beşiktaş, who is working for the Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, both in the stoper and the front free zone, said that Inter had made an offer of 10 million euros.
The Medal'e offer is named after Siyah-Beyazlıların, both sides of the debate and the answer awaits, while the Chilean footballer said he looks forward to living with his family in Istanbul.
Despite Gazzetta's claim, Kara Kartal, who has an FFP limitation, is quite difficult to pay a fee of 10 million euros for the Medal.
As in the first transfer to Caner Erkin, Siyah-Beyazlıtril will be able to earn a serious indirect transfer to Medel'e through a transfer or a bonus service via a transfer, even though the star playeryu kadroya katma is likely to be.

Human rights groups in Missouri issued a travel warning.
The National Association of Colored People in Missouri issued a warning for people of color who are traveling to the state because of the state's discriminatory policies and racial attacks.
The group states: "The Missouri state NAACP Seyahat Tavsiye Bildirisi, effective August 28, 2017, requires African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to exercise special care and extreme caution when traveling from the state as indicated by the recent statewide incidents of racism and racial discrimination".
The NAACP; a new Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement practices that disproportionately target minorities, said the group was effective in issuing this travel warning.
"There is a human rights crisis that is happening to people.
They are being flogged, beaten and killed because of the color of their skin", said Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri NAACP, at the Kansas City Star.
"We hear a whisper of complaint we've never heard before".
Derntrek, for one state in the U.S., is issuing a warning of this kind for the first time.
The group exemplified the racial mockery of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tennessee's Tory Sanders, a black man.
Sanders was detained earlier this year by Missouri police without charge and died under suspicious circumstances after running out of fuel running through the state.
The advisory also highlights a new report from the Missouri Attorney General's Office that indicated that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be hit by a car than white drivers.
"Advice is to alert people to stay awake and warn their families, friends and coworkers about the possibility of moving to Missouri", Chapel said.
"Let people bring the kefalet money with them, let them tell their relatives they are going to cross this state, and be ready".
In Missouri, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were committed in 2015; this ranked the state 16th in the nation in terms of the number of similar crimes.
The Seyahat warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder to prosecute a businessman, accountant, or employee for discrimination in employment.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after local ICRA bodies in those states passed immigration enforcement laws that mandated the detention of people from immigration status; the ACLU says this will increase practices by race.
Seyahat warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently advocacy groups have been applying this practice in response to a number of laws and practices within the United States.
Beşiktaş'ta Dtremba Ba tamam is the first of its kind.
Siyah-Beyazlılar's lease of Demba Ba, Beşiktaş, is back without a fee, between the two seasons ago and last season, when the Chinese team Shanghai Shenhua'ya was transferred for 13 million euros.
Kara Kartal, a football star, took to the streets after a report from the Senegalli game last week asking for a detailed health report.
The Siyah-Beyazlı administration, which had begun work on a 32-year-old player whose Chinese representation had no plans for next season, knocked on the team's door in Shanghai.
The list is not available.
Demba Ba, who was not listed because of his foreign status in China, told the government that Siyah-Beyazlılar wanted to return.
The Chinese team has approved the 32-year-old's departure.
The Senegal international is expected to sign a formal contract with Turkey in the coming days.
Trabzonspor'da Castillo was operated on.
A statement on the Bordo-mavili kulübtrün website indicating that Castillo'nun had undergone an arthroscopic meniscus surgery at İstanbul Liv Hospital said, "The post-operative play performed by Prof. Dr. Uğur Haklar is scheduled to begin training with the team in 4 weeks". if any were given.
Castillo, a member of the board-mavili team, was paralyzed from the waist down in a training game against the Dutch team Heerenveen in the Slovak camp.
The Colombian, who was told he would be away from the field for 3-4 weeks due to treatment, had been ordered to undergo surgery due to a previous meniscus problem.
Barzan'den's referendum is out!
Barzani made a speech at an anma ceremony in Duhok on the 3rd anniversary of the terrorist organization DEAŞ's attack on the Ezidilir in Muslim'un Sincar province.
Speaking about the independence referendum that the ICBY wants to hold on 25 September, Barzani said: "I regret to say that we have no hope that Iraq will be a decent and decent country".
We went all the way to Iraq, but we were completely desperate and desperate.
Our past experiences in Iraq have brought us to this point, and there is no guarantee that we will take away our rights and live up to them.
So, in order to ensure life and security together, we must show the world that we can determine our destiny through a referendum of all of us.
I must point out that the referendum is not a goal for us but a means to achieve a larger goal.
Recalling that the Iraqi central government had placed many demands on Kürtlere since the 2003 fall of the Ba'ath regime, Barzani soon afterwards pointed to the Sincar disaster and said that the direct referendum decision was taken after the fight against DEAŞ.
Expressing that the people of the IKBY want to appoint their leaders in a peaceful and democratic way for their self-corruption and development, Barzani said, "It has become clear that Iraq does not want to survive or survive as a state".
"We're not going to make any progress". his view was sour.
Reacting to the fact that the Iraqi central government did not give them weapons during the fight against the terrorist organization DEAŞ, but that within a short time a fetva and a curulan, Haşdi Shabi'nin, was immediately banned and all weapons were confiscated, Barzani said:
In Iraq's defense system, the Peşmerge, was not a target.
The Merkezi government, Haştr Şabi'ye, was not supported by the Peşmerge.
According to the Peşmerge, the constitution recognizes it as part of Iraq's defense system.
However, when the Haşdi Şabi'tr'nin anayasada bir varlığı yokken, the legal çiğnenerek tüm imkanlar mobilized.
We say we are against Haştrdi Şabi'ye.
Peşmerge and Haştrdi Şabi, the same front, fought, and why one side of Haşdi Şabi was legalized, the existence of the Peşmergenin and the terror struggle being covered up.
These are our deep children in Baghdad.
The terrorist organization DEAŞ, on 3 August 2014, had staged an attack on Ezidile, a resident of the Muslim'un Sincar province, killing many people, including women and children.
10 minutes later the façade was turned into a facelift.
According to the BBC, a Boeing 777 passenger plane belonging to Air France was on board a North Korean missile in Hokkaido, northern Japan.
The officials, who recorded the plane landing 10 minutes ago, said it was estimated to have approached the plane within 100-150 kilometers.
Air France said the plane had not been on its way and that there were no problems with the flight.
The statement, "The information we have at this stage, which we have eliminated, shows that the fuse has fallen over 100 kilometres off the plane's course". was accompanied by a statement.
Nothing is contagious, is it?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Özgürlük Heykeli.
The regime change and the precise sign of the statue are beginning to attack.
Americans know as much as anyone about this; the overthrow of the outlaw Saddam Hussein in 2003 at Firdos Square in Baghdad...
Stephen Miller, one of the key architects of the Trump regime, and CNN's Jim Acosta met the president in a heated debate over legal immigration restrictions, knowing that he had symbolically destroyed the Özgürlük Heykeli, but that he had absolutely not.
To be fair, Miller did not attack himself.
So he said that a dozen tech shop owners and Özgürlük imitators would lynch him.
But he attacked her mania, and especially 17 years after the completion of the 1903 anıt itself, after she had been accused of committing her own mania to the famous anıt base of Emma Lazarus's poem.
Miller, Acosta'ya exclamed: "Ben here at the beginning of the story I don't want to talk about, but Özgürlük Heykeli... is a light-hearted symbol of American freedom to the world.
The poem you mention was added later and is not part of the original Özgürlük Heykeli'".
Miller is right, but as he himself has said, this is not really about history.
This, in connection with the contemporary interpretation of Lazarus's heartbreaking words, seems to be a state inviting not only some elderly immigrants but also the fakir de fakirini: "Yorgun, fakir, / Tıkış tıkış kitleler hasret to take breath of freedom, / Tıklım tıklım karanın perişan ilahimi".
Never before has the "unwanted event" been so visible on our screens.
Miller did not offer a literary criticism; he explained that these people were not welcome in the United States.
The conflict over the manatee of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: It is actually a conflict over the manatee of America.
Lazarus and his companions who campaigned to put his words at the base of the statue after his death were well aware of the highly political implications of the eyleme.
Heykel intended to emphasize the connections between the French and American republics by using a metaphor, representing the body of Özgürlük in female form.
Lazarus changed the meaning: The woman's figure was no longer a soyut, but a sister.
Ve gives himself a very different advert: Expulsion of the Edilenlerin Annesi.
Their image and behavior were a result of a feminist coup and a devastating attack on American immigration.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, so the right-handers have long wanted to change it backwards.
Rush Limbaugh, a great orator who was a Baptist John-like sheep for Trump's arrival, argued in 2010 that Özgürlük did not invite anyone inside, but rather that he was an early devir neocon who held American fire in a dark, dark world: "Bayan Özgürlük comes out.
Oh, freedom was to be transported from the United States to the rest of the world.
"It is not to light the way to the United States of America".
In a very unusual way, Limbaugh had actually discovered something.
Heykelin's manass is entirely about the angle of the blade.
Lazarus's wonderful creative imagination, this is seen as seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often awkward journeys.
It really is about seeing the world from the perspective of people who want to live better lives and find refuge.
His image responded to them with words of hope and warm greetings they needed to hear.
Of course, this is not a perspective that Miller and Trump would be right about in any way.
Their torches are not to guide them, but to dispel the nephritis, their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises the members of the UK team from Scotland.
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scotsmen were called up to the Great Britain squad.
Neil Black, UK Athletics Performance Director, says the 16-man Scotland squad at the World Championships will "bring a huge boost to the team".
The record-setting Scottish athlete was selected for London 2017 which began on Friday.
Black believes that "things are developing" in Scotland and that the UK athletics industry should learn from this.
"We're embracing it and we're trying to understand it and we're going to keep trying until we get out of the business", Black said.
"I talk to people at the Iscoc Sport Institute and they think it's about what they're doing.
ItrScotch Athleticism believes this is about what they did.
Brittany Athleticism: They think it's about what they do.
Koşedeki sokaktaki adam is also so.
Whatever combination of the shots is, it's definitely great".
Many Scottish athletes are competing for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen as captain by the squad.
"Eilidh is a bit of a volunteer.
"The captaincy speech was amazing", Black said.
"In Scotland, wherever she lives or trains, a few athletes in the room have been very proud and really motivated.
Eilidh'in naturally kittı tutku ve real his magnificentdi".
He says it is "unnecessary" for the 16-year-old Scottish to be in the British team, a silver medalist from the Milletler Top, who will compete in the 400m angling at his fifth World Championships.
Scotland's best overall record at the previous world championships was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Last year, five British and two European records were broken by middle distance runners, Muir the leader.
1500 m and 5000 m will be contested.
The British team has had a very good season, as the winner of the British Open and the Rowing Championships, Chris O'Hare, the 1500m runner, has been a different Scotland.
Doyle, the other Teck Scot in the team, remembers his first championship as Lee McConnell.
The team captain, many of his sisters say they are "very proud" that they will not only be in the team but will in some cases compete for a medal and ultimately give a fight to words.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that the votes were cast by the other team members, so it was already a huge honour, but knowing that your teammates voted for you and elected you made it extra special for me".
"Obviously, I am proud of all the Scots who are in my team.
It shows how far we've come.
And they, as a proven athlete, are here as athletes who try to get off the podium.
In response to the Captain's speech?
Yeah, I guess it went well.
I took advantage of the fact that we are very lucky in this situation, in that we have a World Championship ahead of us.
So, it's a fact that we can only benefit from this inner-field support with the impact of being back at the Olympic Stadium and being successful with the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I'm getting a second chance to speak out and fight, and there will be such a great atmosphere".
Blocking voters on Facebook: If you can't take the criticism of voters, you can't run for public office.
We had some information about negative seating in our basement.
Americans were angry with George Washington, but it wasn't long before newspapers began to criticize him severely about everything from domestic politics to political ills.
Of course, the critics were upset.
But his critics were not dismayed.
Because in 1783, Washington declared, "Freedom of speech can be abolished and we can be dragged to the brink in a stupid and silly way".
But, well, I'm bringing Larry Hogan's Maryland suitcase that needs to work harder to be like Washington.
Hogan's staff, who expressed their views on his official Facebook page, enlisted and silenced the comments of at least 450 people.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
Valinin's staff, who were not serious about the matter, reacted with "kimin umrunda?" online comments.
Many people said, "This is just Facebook.tr".
But it is important.
This is especially important when it comes to bears like Htrogan.
The Republican Republican Party, which is a predominantly Democratic, is a surprisingly popular faction.
It has the second highest tasvip rate among the country's 50 suitcases.
Hogan gerici beer is not delitr fischek.
The state has shown a knack for leadership and commitment to its principles.
He jokingly described his hairless post-chemotherapy coffee as a joke, and was quite adept at using Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his constituents.
So blocking people from coming to the valin page, which is a public forum, officially sanctioned and run by members of the public tax dollars paid, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the valine icraats, claiming that blocking comments was more than regulating them.
But it's easy to use images of trolling, spam, or hateful online attacks.
The Post spoke with some of the real people hired by Hogan.
And these are real people who only speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner, and a priest; not trolls.
He said that Hepsi's comments were not offensive, thoughtful or blasphemous.
Papaz, in his parting, quoted from the Bible, referring to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Maryland Bowie'den lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, not a hateful person, but asked questions about hate crimes.
He wrote to the comment section of The Post'un reporter: "I made a comment in a Nazi way that disappointed me with his unanswered remarks on hate crimes and other recent news".
"I also don't like the idea that when many people comment on the same topic, some of them are treated as a collective effort rather than a large group of concerned citizens".
What Valinin's staff dubbed a "intensified spam attack" will likely be dubbed by others as "thought rape".
The Facebook era has made it easier to easily make a message relevant by switching off a message or deleting a negative message.
The personnel outside is much cleaner than in the old days when newspapers with critical writing were collected and sent to the yakma or when protesters had to be arrested and stormed.
But, digital in nature, this is exactly what happened.
Hogan isn't the first gay man to be criticized for having banned Facebook and other social media sites.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have blocked his Twitter account.
One of the decisions that could be a future reference on this topic came last week from Virginia.
According to the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors, US District Judge James C. Cacheris of Alexandria, the first electorate to ban Facebook was the First Amendment.
Kentucky's Matt Bevin (Cumhuriyetçi), de Vali, was visited by the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington's time, the cheap mail had a similar effect to the Internet.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled and his leadership was undermined by anonymous letter writers.
Even Washington had unnamed trolls at the time.
People who used such takma adlar as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers in which they blamed Washington's decisions.
The online George Washington Mail Project, which collects Belgian history, reported that the British government had been criticizing the deal with the office of the dilektronist regarding the Dostluk, Ticaret and Seyrüsefer Agreement.
But Trotter did not scare them away.
Ifade, be a muhalif and be a mu'kaleme freedom is being destroyed in the bottom.
Real leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty, the Renaissance Club's founder, predicted that the club would be in its own comfort.
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty predicts that the Renaissance Club in South Lothian will be in the comfort of the event over the next three days, hosting the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman who came out of the final by leading the next door before losing to Paul Eales at Archerfield Links'tr and is now feeling a new sense of commitment and acting as the tournament ambassador for the club's CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
Rafferty said, "I watched the building of the Renaissance Club and we see that with this organization we have achieved a great deal".
The toy is in good condition, so they will see it in a fevkalade state.
Jerry had a very busy day in the house.
Oh, he is proud of the success of this game and the success of this game.
This is a great showcase for this field".
Although England won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour, Eales will be winning a championship for the first time in his 32-year career.
"This is a really special hissettiriyor", said the Southport-based player.
"I didn't have the chance to win the Extremadura Open because my win was removed from the calendar earlier this year.
It's nice to be back in this part of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
Last year's win was a huge success, and it was a special win for me and my wife Sharon last year.
It was a really special time and we will always know each other in love".
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour earlier this year after turning 50, is making a comeback in his field.
This will be the first Scottish Open since Abertrdeen Asset Management at the 2013 Scottish Open.
Heltrensburgh man Orr said, "When you struggle, it always makes a little more sense".
"You want to do this, but you feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing tektrar and played golf.
This is how we are happy".
The three-time champions included former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Turkey's in a big "propaganda trussü!"
Yes, I am talking about the Diyanet Business Bureau!
Yes, I will be talking about Mehmet Görmez, the head of Diyanet business!
Güntrlerdir...I am answering soruya in the Kafamdaki...
I wonder why Mehmet Görmez'in was taken from Koltuğundan...
I read her article about her assignment.
Yoktr.
I cannot find the answer to the sorrow I am looking for.
Earlier this year...
Mehmet Görmez, head of Diyantret Business (DİB) has prepared the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan.
President Erdoğan has withdrawn 1 million liras S 600 Mercedes models from gold.
Demek Erdoğan was not a big fan.
So what happened?
You may say, "I have served three years and yet I am not".
The first DİB President M. Rıfat Börektrçi served for 17 years.
As all of you know, Mehmet Nuri Yılmaz has been in office for 11 years.
So... the president's term of office is open.
Tektrrar soruma dönüyorum: Why did Mehmet Görmez leave his koltuğundan?
Ishtr understood...
The proximity of the shrine is very high.
A source close to İktidara said: "According to the tradition, Mehmet Dönmez's family did not have circumcision!"
The code for this sentence is this: He did not possess Sunnilyk!
This sentence is used when the person behind it exclaims: - "Geleneksel ulema has found the modernist!"
So, Mehmet Görmez was a new innovator.
Netr demekti innovation?
Mehmettr Görmez's response to the grief was hidden in a foreign trip.
Date: 27th of December 2015.
Mehtrmet Görmez, who is going to be held in Tahran - with the aim of bringing Islam closer - visited Iran to attend the 29th Vahdet Conference.
He met with the religious leader of Iran Ayetullah Ali Hamaney.
He prayed saf tutarak with the Shi'a.
Vetr conference said: "Mezhepler, Islam is a time-formed, humanist movement that represents different ideas and channels in the understanding of religion".
The purpose of hepsinin is to determine Allah's varan stitching.
Her bears are the same, but the paths are the same.
Mezhebi dinle aynitrleştirmek or mezhep mensubiyetini, is never acceptable to see above the truth of Islam.
Mezhebe dayalı is a reflection of the division, idealism and conflict of taassubun ve cehaletin.
Of the places where the mosques have been overtaken by religion, the most damaged religion has been the religion itself...
I want to emphasize again by drawing the gold here:
Şiiler and Sünntriler are the only ones who can...
"No one can be a tekfir because he does not understand Islam as he understands it or lives it as he understands it".
A year later...
Only the Caferi leader Selahattin Özgündüz from Turkey was present.
So...this is tr.
It is not Sünnilik but Vehtrhabilik.
Mehmet Görmez's speech at the conference and visit to Iran made the UN the target of "traditional U.S".
The next Tahran conference represented the Turk Devleti - again - and nobody was present.
Zaten Mehmet Görmez has been invited four times since taking office.
Sebebi belliydi; the Shiite-Iranian anti-DİB "traditional ulema!"
Following the Iranian disaster, Mehmet Görmez's cult was started to be used from early 2016.
At the top of this was Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş, who was responsible for the DİB'tr -dönemin!
Mehmet Görmez was so impressed that he asked for "the DİB Presidency to be tied up".
Ishtrin is a...
There was a difference in the treatment of Sünniliğe within the state.
Theoretical worlds formed in Saudi Arabia and Egypt were formed by the "traditional ulema", who compared Sunniism -in the shadow of the U.N. - to Vehhabi-Selefilik!
These were Tehran's rivals, the Tehran gas station and the non-interventionist Iranian army.
It was not surprising that Cübbeli Ahmet'in Mehmet Görmez said: "Diyanet'e has never been more precise than this".
"Rabbim, the vatana miltrlete bağlı ve Ehlisünnete sadık hayırlı bir reis nasip eylesin"...
"Ehlisüntreti", they used as a symbol of Iranian hostility.
FETÖ'n'un-era CIA-backed Iran's counter-attack was now launching a new name.
Üstelik FETÖ with his compasses...
A photo of a man with a scotch in his hand was sent to the media with the lie "Mehmet Görmez'in's son"!
Ahtr ne tesadüf!
Mehmet Görmez's medal was awarded to a great opponent who did: USA led by the Lightmakers Cemaati'nin Gazette Türkiye!
The result is...
- The Süntrini, the Suudi Vehhabi-Selefi line is being drawn by the...
- To blur the gap between the two...
- Modernist... a cleric, whose conscience was destroyed by the "traditional ulema" formed during the Soğtruk Savaş era...
In the US culture of imperialism, Turkey continues to accelerate the Araplaştırmaya (making of the Vehhabi-Selefi).
You have no doubt that Gelecek Diyanet Chief of Operations will be the Vehhabi-Selefi representative!
"We support the continuation of the Turkish rule"
Foreign Minister Mevtrüt Çavuşoğlu visited China for an official visit.
In the State Konukevi in Beijing, the capital, Çavuşoğlu held a joint meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi.
Vang, "We hope that Turkey will become more active in international consular activities".
China will support Turkey's efforts to preserve its sovereignty, stability and security.
"As far as Palestine is concerned, we hope that the international community, including Turkey, will dissolve", he said.
Speaking about the Ştranghay Cooperation Organization, Çavuşoğlu said: "Turkey, in its quest for close cooperation with regional and international organizations, is not an alternative to each other, but a complementary one".
The second cycle of Ruhtrani resmen begins.
The presidency of Hasan Ruhani, who won the presidential elections in Iran in May, was confirmed by the country's leader Ayetullah Ali Hamaney.

A rare glimpse into the daily life of the former Dutch colony of Papua, which was absorbed by Indonesia in 1969, after a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 people were forced to vote and vote in general before the Union was invaded.
An existing movement that was propagandising independence against the Dutch government quickly turned the population to the Jakarta government, which banned foreign newspapers and hak-zatenim organizations, which controlled the region tightly.
In 2003, the region was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, in a way that would allow independent Papua New Guinea to occupy the eastern part of the island.

But it is also the golden land of Indonesia.
Grasberg, the world's largest and most fertile gold mine, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a mountainous region in the bowels of New Jersey that is home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from the mine.
In addition, Papua has about $78 billion in crop reserves.
In fact, these riches, a source of livelihood for the Papuans, enable the strong Indonesian army to sustain its strong stock.
A 2005 New York Times investigation reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and personnel about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 in compensation per salary.
The Papuans' call for greater autonomy threatens this golden-egg-laying chicken and is in denial of their rights to mercy.
According to Hak Hak advocates, since 1969, more than 500,000 Papuan have been killed by the Indonesian army and more have been subjected to torture, torture and imprisonment.
The 1970s massacre in the mountainous parts of Papua has reached the height of the genocide, according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.
The 2016 report "We'll Do Something" by the Archdiocese of Brisbane contains testimonies of mass executions, such as illegal executions, torture (according to another report, tecavüz and electrical executions are especially popular) and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations carried out the previous year.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because of the weekly events", says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at the Human Rights Institute.
As Papua's resources brought settlers from other parts of Indonesia, the pressures increased.

"Göçmentruk and vegetables are sold in traditional markets at a cheaper price than indigenous Papuans", explains Abeth You, 24, a Paniai native who moved to the regional capital Jayapura for business.
"This has caused the indigenous Papuan people, the Papuan mothers (women) to lose their markets".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, better known as Jokowi, vowed to resolve inequalities and human rights issues in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
As the old marangoz progressed to the presidential palace in Jakarta, Panaia included 27 of the 29 provinces of Papua.
But very little has changed in Papua, and today the local people feel changed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for the austerity that the judiciary will have to re-thesis soon", You says.
In fact, Paniai en badtrunu situation came to life only two months after Jokowi'nin took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children, riding a motorcycle and singing Christmas songs outside a shrines fire in Enarotali, Indonesia, passed through the darkness of the Indonesian military.
The Kortrkan children told them to open their lights.
One of the soldiers was angry with his troops and according to local priest Yavedt Tebai, four soldiers later returned.
He said that soldiers who had drunk alcohol with tanks and tanks were chasing a group and beating them with their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot the boy group.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten that he slipped into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government election commission building was blown up and the next day the events escalated.
About 1,000 Papualan men, women and children from the local police and military commandos gathered to demand a court martial on a football field in front of the military command center.
They carried their torches and waited for the Meetr Pago tribe of Papua to dance (running in the shape of a hula and imitating the bird's nest).
Some protesting police and military garrisons began to attack the stones.
The more violent, underground radio sent an emir to the soldiers: "If the rebels show more than three times resistance, shoot them and kill them".
Jeremiah Kayame (56), the head of the Ktrego Koto neighborhood in Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and demanded a yararak sukunet to return to the fishermen.
No one was going to listen.
"When I turned my back, I suddenly felt like I was in my left leg", he told TIME.
Kaytrame Hala does not know who fired the shots, but says the gunman is descended from a group of soldiers.
"The Kalabalıktı, it was shot several times", he adds.
According to a cousin who witnessed the shooting, the local Alfius Youw was shot three times.

In 2016, Security Minister Wiranto Ekim said that there is an unjust Kurdish mechanism for the protection of human rights.
But the materialtrailer almost started here.
"Most of the tribals were long ago.
Some are in their 90s and some are in their early 2000s.
The point is that we are determined to resolve this issue, but there are processes we have to go through".
5 June, a spokesman for TIME said that there was no complaint mechanism in Wiranto, Papua, and that there was no plan to curb it.
Instead, he said, "Hepsi will be solved by the kanuntr".
Wiranto, who was convicted of more than 1,000 death-related "crimes against humanity" during East Timor's 1999 independence elections, said 11 human rights cases in Papua, including the Paniai incident, had already been resolved.
The families of the victims of Pantriai responded to such claims with bitter skepticism.
"I've been asked to meet four times in the last three years, but nothing has improved", says John.
"Yoruldum. "
A year later, he says he lives in fear.
"I'm scared". he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the soldier, I'm afraid of being shot".
Cardeshi Yacobus repeats the view that the people of Pantriai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by a soldier after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After buriing their graves, a soldier came to me in Aramaic", he says.
Even then, the attacks did not stop.
On Tuesday, Paniai'tr neighbor Deiyai was shot dead by Indonesian police at a farmer's farm.
During a clash between a farmer and a construction company manager who refused to help take an unemployed man to hospital, one person was killed, including 17 children, and wounded.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who was stabbed in a lake near Balık tutarken, died in hospital.
Öfkeli farmers organized a protest outside the company's construction office.
Police said the farmers threw stones at the walls, and they responded by sounding a warning.
But the local people say that a mobile tugayın (Indonesian paramilitary police) shot the fish and killed the bear.
"We were so panicked, we were afraid of revenge", says the 29-year-old Sunday Badii TIME, who lived near the hospital and witnessed the upbringing of the injured.
"I've been on the edge of my seat for the past few days".
Deiyai MP called for the detention of members involved and the withdrawal of the police force from the district.
Pantriai, Indonesia has always been a troubled region for the Indonesian government.
The unrest of the Anlamlı development is fueling the dissatisfaction of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live dispersed throughout the green mountain core of Papua.
Many joined the rebel group Özgür Papua Hareketi'ne (OPM), which claimed to be corrupting the rights of the Papuans by carrying out random attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya, come from Paniai.
As a cevap, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and detained by soldiers under the slogan "milli egemony koruma" in recent years.
Some never cry again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is billed as "a tragic and forgotten place".

Economic inequality between the indigenous Papuans and the Nabire Havalimanı has increased since the opening of new air routes to the area, with more new immigrants arriving.

Tecrit, the world's eyes are turning away from Papua.
Moreover, the restrictions on journalism for international media are being strictly enforced.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua for "lack of coordination with the associated institutions" despite the rare video permission given to them.
Phelim Kine'e, Deputy Director of the Human Rights Organisation Asia, said that the lifting of the news-and-development restrictions and promises to increase the transparency of Jokowi's election campaign were not realized.
In a statement, he said: "There are new threats for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa waivers and blacklisting".
The absence of a network of basins means that the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands) called on the Human Rights Council to investigate "diverse and widespread incidents" in Papua, including the Panaia attacks.
Historically, the same countries have supported OPM.
Arrmanatha Nasir, spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, countered the group's claims to newspapers in Jakarta, saying, "Indonesia's democratic system is legal and free media exists, so it is difficult to cover up the allegations about human rights".
The people of Yertrel want more attention from foreign governments.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands visited Jayapura on May 4 under the chairmanship of the country's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, a source who attended the meeting and asked for an explanation of their faith said that the local people broke their secession with pleas for "We want freedom".
Indonesia has yet to have a presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say it is unlikely that Jokowi will ever vote again.
"A person with good intentions for Jokowi but surrounded by people involved in the Paniai attack", says Gobai, president of the Kabile Council.
Jokowi'nin wants Pantriai people to know that they are not only living under the threat of the impending military dictatorship, but also in the need for education and healthcare.
Gobai, like other Papuans, says that the Paniai people see their vote as a "borç" they give for Jokowi's geri ödemesi.
"They don't need a pariah, they just want an adalet", he says.
Despite the threats and the hardships, the families of the victims of the Paniai attack carried out a symbolic anti-gay act: the burial of the body of the victim in the araziye tomb opposite the police and soldiers station.
They will at least ensure that those responsible are not forgotten about their crimes, noting that the code of conduct can never be enforced.
"One of our family members was killed", says Yacobus, nodding his head.
"What else can we do?"
Yangın, Dubai'nin 'Meşale' skyscraper has fallen for the second time.
A fire in Dubai on Friday destroyed the world's tallest residential towers and forced hundreds of sakini to flee the 337-meter-long 79-story structure.
This is the second major fire in two years, which has spread at a high rate, known as the Meştrale Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and no explanation was given as to the cause of the large fire.
"We were screaming and we woke up to the fire alarm, people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs and reached the 50th floor in about 10 minutes", a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said the fire department had extinguished the large fire at around 4am local time (00:00 GMT) and were cooling the building.
The government has said it is trying to provide shelter for the affected.
This event may bring up questions about the safety of materials used in the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the Meştrale administration following the 2015 fire found that most of the damage was caused by an external panel used for decoration and insulation.
Police in the United Kingdom said they believed the insulation and cloaking system on London's Grenfell Tower, where 80 people died, may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire.
More than 4 binden chronicl hastatrya'social aid' mujdesi is published.
The first phase of the social assistance program to be launched for poor citizens and families struggling with chronic diseases, according to the Ministry of Home Affairs and Social Policy, will benefit 4,300 people with tuberculosis and SSPE.
The Ministry, which plans to provide patients with monthly support of up to two-thirds of the minimum wage through the aid program, will provide regular psychosocial support.
According to the information, details and implementation principles of the "New Social Aid Programme for People with Chronic Illnesses in Eden" have been revealed, which recently began work under the direction of the Minister of Health and Social Policy Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya.
The social assistance program, launched in partnership with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labour to support citizens struggling with chronic diseases and struggling economically and psychologically, has the distinction of being the first of its kind in the world in many respects.
Having completed all the necessary preparations for the launch of the programme, the Ministry will provide families with regular psychosocial support through the social assistance program, not only cash, but also social support.
Thus, the goal is not to leave poor citizens and their families, both physically and mentally, alone while continuing their treatment and treatment processes.
According to the studies, in the first phase, poor citizens who are struggling with tuberculosis and a brain disease caused by measles will be provided regular psychosocial and cash support under a new social assistance program to the poor citizens who are struggling with Subakut Sclerozan Panensephalitis (SSPE), a brain disease caused by the measles microbes.
In later stages of the program, it will be covered by the poor citizens' assistance program, which fights with other rare and risky diseases.
In addition to the support planned to be given in excess of two-thirds of the minimum wage, the payment will be made to tuberculosis patients who have been diagnosed with a medical condition, who are caring for their medical staff, who are bedridden or who have a medical condition that requires improving living conditions.
To be eligible for the benefit, the minimum wage per person must be less than two-thirds of the net amount of the minimum wage.
In addition, citizens with SSPE disease must have a health council report prepared in accordance with the procedures and principles set out in the "Özürlülük Ölçütü, Sınıflandırma and Özürlüller Verilecek Health Board Reports on Management" of the health council.
According to the survey, more than 1 in 5 US passengers brought illegal items into the plane.
According to a survey of airline passengers, more than 20 percent of them have unknowingly or unwittingly hijacked unlawful items from the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration's checkpoints, including unknowingly hijacked knives or other small objects carrying at least 6 percent.
Less than one percent claimed to have accidentally made the trip with firearms, mortars or explosives.
A study of more than 1,000 people conducted by the jet charter service Stratostr Jet Charters found that younger passengers were also more willing to break the rules.
Among the participants who admitted to trying to fly a TSA-banned billiard jet, 19.7 percent were Y-class, although 15 percent were X-class.
The TSA agents were kidnapped with general items of food and liquids.
More than 3 percent of the participants admitted to having passed through the safety of the drug, while 2.2 percent of the female and 3.7 percent of the male participants admitted to carrying illegal drugs.
The firm said it conducted a nationwide poll of people who had smuggled in by mistake from airport security and to find out how many had been smuggled by billiards.
It is not surprising that many people have been able to sneak through security without knowing it.
However, as the firm notes, the TSA rules are a bit of a metaphor and a confusing one.
People are often unsure of which fluids or how many they can carry.
So it is no surprise that the TSA has revealed el koyulan en grande miktardaki maddenin as banned liquids.
For a while, people thought that the TSA might be treating books like smugglers.
Flyers are allowed on domestic flights but not on international ones.
China has welcomed the US's comments.
At a press conference in Beijing, Tillerson told the Pyongyang administration that "we are not looking for an excuse to send our troops to the 38th parallel, but we are looking for a regime change, a collapse of the regime, a rapid reunification of the peninsula and a return to the country".
Chinese Foreign Minister Vangtr, Tillerson, reiterated that the Washington administration stressed the problems with North Korea, and expressed his support that the United States effectively implemented these problems in a policy that focused on results.
Stressing that the security of the Korean Peninsula is a priority, Vang stressed that the parties expect a middle way where they can resolve their concerns through equal dialogue, and that the Beijing administration has long been an insistent supporter of the peninsula's nuclear disarmament, preservation of peace and stability, and the resolution of problems through dialogue and negotiation.
EPA President Pruitt, Obama has refused to pass the emissions reduction laws.
A day after being sued by 15 states, the president of the Fourth Circuit, Scott Pruitt, withdrew his decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era laws that cut emissions of air pollution.
Pruitt represented change by having his own organization, state environmental regulators, more sensitive to the needs of the past than previous administrations.
Birtr never mentioned the legal objection raised in the Federal High Court against his previous position.
The issue is that the states have begun meeting the 2015 standards for ground level ozone by the end of October 1.
Pruitt, his own organization, had announced that it would postpone the Haziranda accord for a year to give more time to work on its plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth".
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's attorney general before being appointed by President Donald Trump, had long served as a reliable ally against stricter environmental regulations.
Since Pruitt arrived in Washington, he has repeatedly taken action to block or disrupt regulations against the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
On Wednesday, the day of the change, Pruitt'in regulation geri alma agenda for en son hukuki yenilgisi.
Last month, a federal high court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator's attempt to curb the practice of demanding that oil and gas companies, a law of the Obama administration, detect and reduce methane leaks was in violation of its authority.
In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that the reversal in ozone standards only reinforced EPA's commitment to meet new standards on time with states and work through complex processes.
In his previous case, Eden Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times, said: "Under these administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines for decisions, waited for action by activist groups and others, and agreed on the timing of the decision".
"We don't believe in regulation by litigation and we take deadlines seriously.
We will also take the canon and its verdict against us seriously".
Yet in an EPA statement, Pruitt'in said he could once again use his "power to regulate and all other legally available powers" to ensure that regulations are "supported by sound policies and the best available information".
Congress Republicans are pushing for a broader rewrite of ozone laws.
A bill passed by the House of Representatives last month seeks to delay the implementation of the 2015 laws for at least eight years.
It has not yet been introduced for the Senate election.
This week, the EPA was sued by the state's state-led coalition of attorneys general Eric Schneiderman, who said the group was determined to continue the legal battle.
Schneiderman said: "The EPA's decision to change the law after our findings is a significant improvement in the health and safety of the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the pollution that affects 6.7 million New Yorkers and their communities".
The meeting was attended by representatives from New York, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
When the general atmosphere is exposed to sunlight by automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources that respond to sunlight in the atmosphere, ground-level ozone is produced when the general atmosphere is exposed to sunlight.
The resulting smoke is a group of people who are easily affected by madness that can cause serious respiratory problems and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists applauded Pruitt's surprise decision-making change.
Lori Ann Burd of the Biological Diversity Centre said: "It is inconvenient to find that so many Basque people need to be trained to achieve this healthy level of diversity".
"We must continue to fight the ideological struggle of the Trump administration, the environment, the politicians and the interest groups".

"If this is the way it goes, this people will soon be faced with a self-serving health care group", he said.
The actions of health workers Ankara İl Sağlık Müdürü Dr. Kamil Türkmen, Ankara Birinci Bölge Kamu Hastaneleri General Secretary Prof. Dr. Öner Odabaş, Turkey Yüksek İhtisas Eğitim ve Araştırma Hastanesi Başhekimi Prof. Dr. Mustafa Paç and the hospital's hospital wardens have also given their support and support.
Olayı kınayan Paç, said:
Violence against health workers is on the rise.
An example of this occurred yesterday evening when we were revived by the beating of a patient by our cardiologist, a close relative.
Despite all the measures that have been eliminated as our state, ministry and validity to prevent these events from happening sooner, we demand that the sensitivity of our people to this conundrum be increased.
I apologize for yesterday's events on behalf of my hospital and my healthcare staff.
Odabaş, noting the need to raise awareness in the community about health and violence, said, "The age in which we live is a complicated one".
"We're going to take our own precautions, or more importantly, our nation's own health care worker", he said.
Noting that the judicial process on Olay had begun, Türkmen de, "Our laws on Sağlıkta violence have been sufficiently effective".
Devtrletin cademeler implemented this.
Currently, the emniyet is working.
In the past, these were always empty, but now they are directly prosecuted and the state attorney is assigned to the case, following the case.
He used the phrase "Through the var samples of heavy penalties taken in connection with the gun".
After the announcements, the employees continued their work.
According to the allegations, the incident occurred around 5:45 p.m. the day before.
The relatives of the patient who died in intensive care, Dr. Hamdi Mehmet Özbek'e, a member of the Kalp and Damar Cerrahi department, who reported the death, attacked.
Uzbek, while being removed from the scene by doctors and assistants; the hospital police were called.
While Olayda Özbek'in was burned, the attackers were detained.
A doctor who witnessed the incident said:
When our friend went to his patients to report the death of a patient, he attacked our friend and our two friends.
Our friend's burns broke, and he was left in a ditch.
Then we took our friend to the operating room and put him in a bag.
For 15-20 minutes, security checks are performed between us.
If the patient had broken through the family or the security wall, much worse would have happened.
Gaziantep DEAŞ suffered a heavy blow: 102 soldiers...
According to the report, in the course of the investigation being conducted by Gaziantep Cumhuriyet Başsavcılığı, as part of the investigations into the DEAŞ armed terrorist organization, the Gaziantep Emniyet Müdireküteri Terörle Mücadele Şube Müdirekünce's investigative work, 5 thousand 100 kilograms of ammonium nitrate were transferred from 102 containers used in the explosive plant in a warehouse operation located in Kayaönü Mahallesi'de, which was determined to belong to the DEAŞ terrorist organization.
In the operation, in which six people were detained, suspects were seized in their homes, workplaces, warehouses and upper searches, along with 10 long-barreled guns, which contained 35 chargers, 2 370 long-barreled guns, 3 shotguns, 7 barreled guns and 382 long-barreled guns, 2 rifle-guns and 1 shovel, 39 705 TL and 15 870 USD, a total of 163 thousand TL bills signed for different persons, 40 thousand 500 TL cheque books, 2 blank cheque books and a large number of digital items were sent.
In the aramas were found four books containing the final decision, which were taken out by the broadcasting bodies of the FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization.
Six people were detained and after their interrogation were taken to the judicial authorities.
The suspects, who were also reportedly being held by the Nabetçi Sulh Ceza Hakimliğince, were arrested.
The rainfall of the Suriye'de YPG...
The US military intervened.
According to reports from local sources, the AA's YPG terrorists, backed by the US military, looted the homes of Tel Semin residents in the northern suburbs of Raqqa where they were fighting the terrorist organization DEAŞ.
Evleri was looted and the reaction of the civilian population was turned into organized terror and conflict.
In response, US forces in the region entered the region armed with armored vehicles.
Cougar MRAP tanks, personnel carriers and Husky-type light trucks were seen to form a buffer zone in the area.
The terrorist organization YPG, which is part of the anti-DEAŞ operation, does not allow civilians who escaped from Rakka'da and were shot dead as part of the operation to enter the controlled cities.
The local activist movement "Rakka sessiztrce katlediliyor" yesterday announced that 121 civilians had died in the topçu fires in July alone.
Let us not carry the old world's rubbish tomorrow.
The perpetual perception of the realities of the world can lead to crises in countries, not in individuals.
One of the reasons why the backward East, which we describe as "sharkly", is so perverse about world realities, may be that the reflection of these realities on the geography of the East is blocked by certain points of view or that the truth is conveyed in a different way.
Don Kişot and Oblomtrov have been the subject of literary debate in the world, whether to recognize or not the realities and changes that occur.
Cervantes's "Dontr Kişot" in the period when the bourgeoisie began to form, still bears his name.
Although Gonçarov is an "Oblomov", it is a myth that when the facts are revealed, everything can go on like a sketch.
China, for example, was a country open to the world and free to the sea until the late 15th century, when the island was closed by the succession of a dynasty.
This lasted until the execution of the captains of the ships that sailed out of the Chinese Black Sea.
We Turklers, who have one foot, eye and ear in the West, and the other foot, eye and ear in the East, have had constant difficulties in perceiving reality and change, starting with the Ottoman.
Old and new One of our chapters refuses to move the day to the present, to understand the present with schemes that fit the old conditions, to know the day tomorrow.
Some of us, however, have been able to quickly adapt to the changing perceptions of reality and the world as well as the thinking centers of developed countries.
This situation has been a source of constant conflict, friction.
The encounters between science and university, between modernity and modernity, between faith and doubt, have led to a dramatically-contented dualism.
The worst of all, the new and advanced routes of a given era, the certain routes that would eventually expire and the routes that would eventually run, were not accepted.
Yesterday's illicitists, one period after another, proclaimed the new and advanced "Tehlikeli", while those who tried to interpret the yurt and world conditions in accordance with current reality began to proclaim "Hain".
In the Ottoman Empire, the people who were constantly aware of the reality of the yurt and the world became dominated by the thought and state life, eventually the empire collapsed, the people fell into poverty.
An important lesson from our Ottoman history in the Republic is the fact that the rapid perception of world conditions and change is an inevitable prerequisite for a stable peace.
Because this lesson was so well absorbed, we have become the model nation of geography that has succeeded in maintaining unity, integrity, and stability in peace since World War I to the present day.
To survive and survive the global change process that is being driven by a different approach, we need to let go of the recklessness and adapt to reality.
In other words, no one will be able to resist the pointless campaigns and lawsuits that have led to the collapse of our democracy in the past.
In today's world, even small mistakes lead to very large and dramatic crises.
The geography of this problem is the Ortadoğu'dur in which we live.
The history of the operation is not lost.
A statement from the Valilit said that the Il Jandarma Commune had carried out an operation related to the smuggling of historical items.
It stated, "As a result of the work done, two suspects worked with two gold coins, one silver coin, 20 bronze coins, one gold bracelet, two bronze rings, one broken camel bracelet, four stone objects, eight necklaces, one pink and white stone object, one picture frame, 23 different printed and sized objects and in different colors, four metallic objects, six pieces of metallic equipment with age-appropriate covers and pages, and some pages were torn apart in Arabic with the Qur'an-Koran script, one piece of stone or ker, 10 pieces of old bronze equipment with age-appropriate covers and pages were torn apart in different books, one piece of stone or paperwork, and one piece of bronze metal fabric was torn apart in different sized chapters".
"We will continue our operations to combat crime and criminals for the peace and security of our people with determination".
Turkey is a windy country.
Turkey's future is a global development, and the recently realized wind farm in the country has struggled.
The world record for the production of models that the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources has devised to provide a million-million-dollar energy transition by reducing external dependence has been broken.
Turkey's energy costs have been reduced by a $1 billion investment and 4,000 jobs.
Local wind turbines will be installed in the system by early 2019.
The renewable energy resource areas (YEKA) wind power plant licensing scheme, which was opened by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MOE), included 8 consortia of US, Chinese, German and Danish developers.
İtrhalede, first in the low bidder 5 bidders were identified in order to open financial offer envelopes.
After the first few bid envelopes, the lowest bid was $4.19 per kilowatt hour.
The open margin of error was set at 0.01 cents.
After the launch of İhale, the joint venture groups Enertrcon, Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas have decided not to participate in the open expansion.
In the open exhibition, teams from Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang competed.
After the consortium that Nordex was in, MingYang-İlk İnşaat and Siemens-Türkerler-Kalyon were able to build the new joint venture.
MingYang-Ilk İntrşaat has won the award 11 times.
The Siemens-Türkertrler-Kalyon Enerji consortium has never used a single spring.
Enerji and Tabii sources: A record day for Turkey.
The open exile of 30 tours continued.
The intense tension between the two consortia was mostly a result of a joint venture between Siemens-Türkerler-Kalyon, which offered low bids of 3.48 cents/kilovat hour.
While the consortium offered $3.49 per cent per kilowatt-hour, the proposal was received at 3.48 by telephone from the Fish Commission headed by Müsteşar's Deputy Alparslan Bayraktar.
In the two-hour YEKA race, Turkey set a world record.
The price of $3.48 per kilowatt hour offered by the company is the world's lowest ever.
The previous record was set by Mexico at $3.84 per kilowatt hour.
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak, who organized a press conference following the conclusion of the talks, said that the victory of German company Siemens in the competition was an important message to the region and the world: "Looking at the 200-year history of cooperation between Turkey and Germany, I think this will make a significant contribution to Turkey-Germany relations".
Our targets are big.
The results of today's survey have shown how steady and reliable the economy and energy markets are moving toward the future.
I am very proud to have shown with this discovery that Turkey, no matter how regional the world may be, is at the forefront of the region and the world's most trusted investment countries.
"Tüm Türkiye, we are 80 million and proud of this image, in a great contribution, in 15 years of experience and leadership, is Cumhurbaşkanımız, which carries Turkey to this point", he said.
Expressing the fact that it is a new era in which open, transparent and comparable competition is taking place, Albayrak said: "One of the most important steps of the year, the first time that the wind has been delivered at a cost of 10.3 dollars/cent per kilowatt hour, a record fall of 3.48 dollars/cent, a world record price, with a tonne of local input".
I am proud of this, on behalf of my country.
Noting that the first domestic solar power production panels are targeted to be delivered before the end of 2018, Bakan Albayrak said, "We will be integrating our domestic wind turbines by the beginning of 2019".
Türtrbinler is divided into five regions.
The winning company will be divided into five regions and will operate at least 50 megawatts of wind power per unit with a combined capacity of one megawatts per unit.
The total investment in the Siemens-Türkertrler-Kalyon group will be more than $1 billion.
When the local wind farms start operating, they will produce an average of 3 billion kilowatt hours of electricity annually and meet the annual electricity needs of about 1.1 million wind turbines.
The Kurulacak wind turbines will reduce CO2 emissions by an average of 1.5 million tonnes per year.
The company that won the competition invested over $100 million and built a factory.
The plant will produce an average of 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines with a capacity of at least 2.3 megawatts.
At least one third of the consortium, the canoe, generator design, materials technologies and production techniques, software and innovative gearbox engineering will be doing research and development over 10 years in a total of 5 areas.
With a budget of $5 million a year allocated for R&D and geotechnical research, 50 technical personnel, 80 percent of whom are local engineers, will be employed.
The factory will be shut down 21 months after the contract is signed.
The project license is for a period of 30 years.
Kazım Türker, Chairman of the Board of Directors of İhaleyi's winning consortium Türkerler İnşaat, said that domestic production would be about 64 percent of the project, with 35 percent of the equipment coming from abroad, saying, "We plan to finance the equipment from foreign sources, and the remaining part from local banks".
Türker noted that the Turkish economy reflected his confidence in the Turkish economy.
Murtaza Ata, president of Kalyon Holding Enerji Group, said: "Turkey's dependence on external sources has become a major problem, reducing its dependence on external sources by a few megawatts".
"Sonuçtan memnunuz" he said.
Noting that the company has been operating in Turkey for 160 years, Hakan Yıldırım, Managing Director of SItremens Gamesa Türkiye Üst, said: "We will do a complete elimination of the electricity grid to further reduce the costs of electricity generation".
The landfill rate for wind turbines manufactured by the factory will be reduced by 65 percent.
65 percent of the eight bin industrial parts in the wind turbine will be local (about 5,200 pieces).
In 5 regions with a capacity of at least 50 MW, a total of 1000 MW of power will be generated.
3,750 people will be employed for 10 years and $5 million will be allocated annually to research and development activities.
1,000MW wind turbine capacity 65% Yerlik Oranı En az 2.3 MWe power generation between 300 and 450 domestic wind turbines.
Over $1 trillion in investment Annual 400 MW/year wind turbine production capacity over 100 million dollars in factory investment.

Moore'un Ford catlitramı: Activists Adalete Çağrı İçin Irkçı Linç Olayını Yeniden Canlandırdı was founded by the activists.
A 1948 model Ford Mercury, Monroe was passed through a group of street riders in rural Georgia and proceeded to the small Ford Bridge in Moore.
Four black passengers and a white driver drove a car, before reaching the bridge, an armed group of white men went out to cross the road.
A middle-aged man in a fine-checkered suit took a long breath from the mouth of the cheetah leader and looked carefully inside the front camdan.
Inside, they sat in fear and irked.
"We want to, Roger!" said Adam.
"Try to get him out!"
A young black man before the passenger was dragged from the station and screamed through the darkness.
Neither, on 22 June, this appalling scene was played only once again.
But when a spark was thrown around the neck of Roger's neck, almost everyone realistically nodded.
Since 2005, human rights advocates have been returning to the Ford Bridge in Moore to recreate the lynching of two black couples (Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey) by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
To date, no one has been charged with any crimes.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the Yentriden retreat, said: "It is not inconceivable that during all these years, not one person has been arrested who knows who they are in our toplumes".
"This is a burden on our souls, but not on history".
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia state congressman and lifelong human rights activist.
For Kendisi, this re-imagining is a dramatic eyleme call and an annual reminder to Monroe society that no injustice has ever been corrected.
He said: "We want a trial, we want results, we want children to be embraced, we want a compromise, but first we have to get justice".
"We cannot have a fair trial of the children and a fair trial until we have achieved justice".
A sheet was placed on the body of one of the victims of the Ford Lincoln at Moore on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 male lynchings from Monroe and surrounding areas were suspected.
But Bir Tanesi has never been investigated.
Suspects, who for years have been smuggled into the world as human rights defenders, claim that the twin motivations of lynchings have always been very good at the heart of the matter: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote in a primary election for the first time at the end of the summer.
According to the FBI, at the same time as the election, black partner Roger Malcom apparently stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight over a woman.
Brooks; the gossipy gossipster stated that Hester knew Malcolm's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcolm from prison.
Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey were also jailed.
But as the car was driving away from the prison, a gang of lynch mobs surrounded the car while they were driving along the Ford Bridge at Moore.
An FBI report concluded, "It seems that Harrison was the one who arranged the murders and gave the order".
"There was also a secret agreement between the state and local law enforcement agencies that had not only taken the cinayette, destroyed evidence, and concealed the identities of eyewitnesses".
Brooks is shorter and narrates himself.
"This was a massacre", he said.
"Hepsi was killed to send a message to the black people in this community: 'If you register and vote, this is what will happen to you.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the redesign of the Ford Bridge linchpin at Moore, which took place her year.
His performance is meticulous, eye-catching, and based on a deep-seated form of racism that many believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to read and even to translate, but Greene says it's the same.
He said: "We don't want to talk about Lintrç because it makes us all face the ugliness within us".
"But if you don't listen to me or what's happening to me, I'm going to build a relationship with you".
This year's production rehearsals began in Haziranda and on the first day, nearly 30 actors (a dozen white and black veterans) attended a one-day event and listened to Greene's well-proven general lines.
Wade Marbaugh, who serves as an assistant director at Greenetr'in.
For years he played the role of the Klansman's President, but he says that role never got easier.
"I feel so guilty because it's not me", Marbaugh said.
"But this past is very important because we don't want to go back to that time".
Throughout the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, were rehearsing their own lines.
Malcolm starts the game by yelling at Hester, who is so angry that he has sex with his wife Dorothy, and starts by tearing her down.
"Ztr....i, get out of here, I said!"
Rastrcona is reacting.
Birtr vurma session was.
And then everyone (at least the black actor) will be able to make a big deal.
But Greene is laughing.
Rascona said "No?!" and he nodded.
Telaşlıdı, he was surprised.
How much do I serve?
Greene said "No" in the keynote address.
"It's just that I don't think white people used to say 'z...i.'"
One of the political actors jokingly said "Etrvet" and threw a mixture of stones.
"'You must be a good man.'
So the energy in the room changes and some kind of closeness replaces the unrest.
Everyone is committed to doing this right, not only for the sake of the game but also in memory of the four people who were killed.
Sahtrne is starting again.
This time Rascona N is saying the first word, keskin ve vurgulu.
No one is laughing.
Yentriden can be adjusted sharply and quickly.
There were screams, gunfire and then silence.
A woman dressed in black stands on the bodies of actors and reads Billie Holiday's sad methyesies "Garip Meyva".
Her two words in the first session are broken.
A hundred yards of the average gauge of four dozen or so spectators shed tears from the eyes of a group of tears.
The audience is almost evenly divided into black and white.
A couple, who came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many of them were traveling.
Brooks took them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys, all of whom spent nearly eight hours in Georgia's invading territory.
Until then, the cinayettr had been a bit of an anecdote, or it meant that the durmak had come to the same place where the lynx was now.
As the song's notes weaken, Greene invites the band to come closer and examine their bodies.
The children are lying on their hands, clutching false blood and immobile bodies and whispering to each other.
A little boy whispers, as if reminding himself, "They didn't really die".
A few minutes later, Greene thanked the fisherman and suddenly stood by.
The actor is wearing a linchpin and wiping his tears.
Bradshaw, the president of the Klansman, is wearing the Marbaugh's suit.
Nick Rascona is hugged by two of his fellow actors and tears gush from their eyes, causing the emotional impact of his performance to eventually fall on him.
The cardinal bears whisper, "It's all right".
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did this for a reason".
Then the actors sat down to eat with the actors.
A white couple from Atlanta, a black couple from Atlanta, are having a chatter about the transformation.
Denise Duplinski struggles to find words to describe how her performance makes her feel.
"These horrible, horrible words and behaviours... come from people who work hard and do it because they are hardworking", he said.
"What this kid is doing, making the lynchings think it's going on", he added, "is that they're no longer just denying police armed attacks".
Tyrone Brooks is sitting at the table outside the room, eating and telling stories of human rights.
He said he's already started planning his next year's performance.
"Yentriden's interpretation is in a way inspiring because it describes what we are bound to but also teaches us".
"Mr. Sanki, you're not learning from this, it's like it could happen again.
Those who do not investigate their own past, those who do not know their own past, are condemned to repeat it".
Muğla'da kaza: 4 dead; 6 wounded
According to reports, a 48 YS 411 license plate car operated by Adem Sağlam, collided with a 09 B 1510 license plate car operated by Sinan Kıroğlan at the Salkım station on the Kavaklıdere-Yatağan railway.
A number of health and rescue operations were carried out in the area of the incident on the 112-acil Çağrı Merkezine.
Kazada died at the scene of the accident, where she was eight months pregnant with Duraniye Kıtrğlan and Derya Kıroğlan and Yasemin Sağlam, and Mertcan Kıroğlan died at the Yatağan Devlet Hastanesi, where she was taken.
Yaralanan Sinan, Senem, Furkan Kıroğlan and Adem, Yılmaz and Abdullah Yiğit Sağlam Muğla Sıtkı Koçman University of Education and Research Hospital and Yücelen Hospital were removed from the hospital.
The patients were found to be still in active life.
The Yatağan-Kavaklıdere railway was temporarily closed due to the accident.
Kavaklıdere Belediye Chief Mehmet Demir and Yatağan Jandarma Komutanı Yüzbaşı Engin Ocak were briefed on the incident and were immediately informed of the accident.
The AKtr Parti'den kongreye is a private website.
by the AKtr Parti, 6.
A website called "akkongreler.com" was created for the Congressional process.
On the websites, the brochure, material and instructions for the party organization to use in this process were provided.
In the "Communication Strategy" section of the site, the 14 headings of the congressional agenda were listed.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is also the general president of the AK Party, warned the members of the organization to follow the party's curriculum during the congress.
In a message from Erdoğan, "We are now beginning a new era of achievement".
We must renew and redistribute our plans to achieve our 2023 targets with more solid steps.
"Thrun is like yesterday, tomorrow is like tomorrow, we must continue to work together", he said.
To restructure the business, Pearson made another 3,000 layoffs, costing the car a second time.
British education group Pearson, while launching another restructuring programme to overcome the pressure facing the business, said it would on Friday dismiss 3,000 more people and cut its share of the workforce by 72 percent.
According to CEO John Fallontr, the layoffs, which will mostly take place between late 2018 and early 2019, will add to the 4,000 positions lost in the previous restructuring.
Pearson, in May, announced a plan to save 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) by trying to speed up digital learning with a third cost-cutting program.
The firm, which last September admitted to paying a fee to Penguin Random House partner Bertelsmann, said there was no change in the outlook for this year after reporting a 1 percent increase in core sales to £2.05 billion in the first half.
Mettrin 2 once again led to death!
According to the first report of Adli Tıp Kurumu, the first bulletin in Hakan's pre-op autopsy report stated that the death was suicide.
In a detailed examination, no signs of darp and aloe were found on the child's body.
The cause of suicide is the inflated inflated inflated boynth due to the compression of the elastic bands.
Ailesinin is marked as sargı bezi, bezin, and was determined to be an elastic bandage used in yarlama.
According to the newspaper Habertürk'ten Müslim Sarıyar, after a detailed report on the child's death was prepared, it was learned that the report stating that the incident was a suicide would be sent to the Büyükçekmece Cumhuriyet Savcılığı, which is conducting an investigation.
The police investigate the boy's suicide in detail, and afterwards scan the computer of the consular.
The friends of Poltrisin Hakan also indicated that ifadesine would occur.
Information from Hakan's computer, which his relatives called "Temiztrlenmiş", is said to have access to third parties or a gang.
Police are investigating whether Hakan was dragged by a gangster.
Gaining certainty that Hakantr's suicide was a suicide, his eyes turned violent to Metin2".
Reacting on the grounds that it causes child addiction and abuse, last year Antalya's governor's office brought to light the 2009 murder of Metin2, which was banned for children under 15, and again the murder of 13-year-old "minik hacker" Metin Kang.
To play "Metin2", developed by Kore'de 2005, you need to log into the site and create a record.
Oyuncular, the game's ejder god, is trying to provide huzuru and adaleti in the world.
In doing so, there are fights, and the dose of violence increases.
Besides the images of warfare with delicious weapons, such as oytrunda satir, sword, spear, balta, and other weapons, the images of humans being torn apart by wild animals are also being displayed on the screen.
The player is buying parayla characters to strengthen himself.
The family who buried their children the next day, after the incident that occurred on July 25 at the Esenyurt İstiklaltr Mahallesi Köknar Sokak'taki home, continued to claim the murder.
Baba Mehmet Ekinci, "All dreams of being a doctor, we do not think that the game can harm him or anyone else", said: "They wore the elastic sergeant boynuna and knotted the side knot".
I found it in another way, my son.
We certainly don't think our son could harm himself or anyone else by playing a game on the Internet or committing suicide.
We knew he played a game like this.
The hashir was not a game he played.
Let's say that a little bit of a canter is used when he leaves the game.
Anne Gülizar Ekinci, "There is no turning-point inside the building".
It is rumored that the boy entered the house at one time.
None of them are looking at each other.
When Ağatrbeyi arrived on the eve, he was wearing only sandals.
"When my mother was found dead, there were 2 sandals next to the computer", he said.
İlker KARAŞ: Çeteye may have been bullied.
Aileler generally ignores this conundrum.
"Whatever happens to my child in the house", they watch closely.
Kids, through games, many people communicate with people.
There may have been a debt-to-own debt situation or a blasphemy.
Or even if you invited one person to the game, there may have been some problems.
Directly through the game, but also through the game, someone may have been affected by problems with other people he communicated with.
The game's simplicity, the curse of the child may have been real.
The trauma that drives the intr intrhara may be related to blackmail.
The child or the family faced a situation of complaint and could not solve this problem, so it was dragged into a situation of uncertainty.
Oytrun could not have committed suicide because of himself.
The child is not likely to be contacted.
It could be that he's a bully.
There can be nothing that the child could have done alone.
Advising Advertising Systems Füsun NEBİL: The interaction of the children of foreigners should be improved.
We can't say that games are harmful.
Research suggests that games are beneficial for children's development.
What's important here is that parents pay attention to what their children play and how they talk online about play.
Aileler should take precautions, knowing how children are affected by what content.
Turkey's only two children were born in the 5 senede, where the game is said to have killed them.
This shows that the child's life is not only affected by the games.
Was there a child like that?
First we have to find out.
The sociology and psychology surrounding the child should be considered.
The Istanbul Stock Exchange's eight-month yield was up 50 percent.
The upward trend that started in December 2016 in the BIST 100 index continued in July and the upward trend was up 8 inches.
Thus, the index rose for the first time since July 2007 by 45.3 percent over the same period, for eight consecutive months.
The BIST 100 index, which has been dominating the world's major stock exchanges, including Germany, the US, the UK, Japan, among its performance since the beginning of the year, has not lost its lead in yield in July.
The BIST 100 index, which completed July with a 7.06 trillionth of a year, rose 2.54 percent, followed by the US Dow Jones index, 0.81 percent, and the UK FTSE 100 index.
The Almaya's DAX index and Japan's Nikkei index both ended July with a loss of value.
When the BIST 100 index was compiled for the period January-July, it showed a high performance from both the major world stock exchanges and the emerging market indexes.
This year, as of the end of 2016, the BIST 100 index gained 37.6 percent, followed by a 10.76 percent increase in the Dow Jones index, a 5.55 percent gain in the DAX index, a 4.55 percent increase in the Nikkei index, and a 3.21 percent increase in the FTSE 100 index.
The MSCI EM index, an indicator of the emerging market, yielded a return of 23 percent.
When the BIST 100 index was tracked, it was found that the past showed similar performance.
In the last eight months between December 2006 and July 2007, the BIST 100 index, which completed an eight-month period of value gains, had seen a 38.3 percent increase over that period.
It also completed the BIST 100 index by gaining value in eight months between August 1996 and March 1997, and nine months between May 1997 and January 1998.
Mexica Investment Research Director Eren Can Ümüt, AA correspondent, said in a statement that the BIST 100 index has continued to rise for eight months, and that it has surged 37 percent since the beginning of the year.
Overall, MSCI's emerging market (EM) index is up 23 percent, and if we look at these figures alone, there is a positive difference.
The fall of funds in developing countries has been ongoing since the beginning of the year.
Especially funds in the search for high returns prefer countries with higher interest rates.
This situation has a positive impact on the domestic market.
Of course, on a global scale, risk appetite is one of the highest.
This is because the index of rağbet is not a risky asset.
The US S&P 500 trends have been up nearly 11 percent since New Year's Eve, and we're seeing new record levels tested here this week.
Emphasizing that the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) 3 percent interest rate forecast markets are under stress but that it is quite well using the Fed's policy of directed interest to eliminate uncertainty, Ümüt noted that there is a lack of interest rate confidence in the Fed.
Overall, the inflation rate in the U.S. is not yet at the desired level, the Fed will not be quick to raise interest rates and will avoid radical moves, and its clients are highly effective at current price quotes.
He said that the Obamacare healthcare reforms of President Donald Trump have strengthened the perception that the expansionary fiscal policies will not deliver on the promises of the expanding financial policies, adding that "the faster-growing U.S. economy, thanks to Trump, will positively impact the markets for a period of time in response to the promises of faster growth and faster inflation".
Ümüt noted that 2016 was a year of many negative developments in the Turkish market, and noted that the difference between the two was in the midst of closing efforts to compare the similarities of the BIST 100 index, which was negatively divided and over-sold.
Noting that they do not see a strong recovery from the domestic news flow, Ümüt noted that the current view may be interpreted as a trigger for the demand to close the gap between the increase in risk appetite abroad and similarities in domestic markets.
Overall, he expressed that he was following a certain amount of car sales on the BIST 100 index, technically testing its 108,600 levels and new records:
Especially 109,500-110,000 short-range critical areas are at risk.
After approaching these levels, sales of the cartridge are normal.
In the short term, we believe a new local or global story should be created for the 110,000 market price tag.
A drop in the 107,500 support for now could trigger cartridge sales.
In this case, I think we can see a change in the range from 106,000 to 105,500 if we follow the 107,000 support.
In particular, breaking the 105,500-strong support could lead to a withdrawal of 104,300 to the level of 100,000 to 108,600, which Fibo estimates is 50 percent higher.
Noting that both the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) decisions will be at the center of global market, Umüt said that the expectations for the Fed are now clear, but that the FOMC's interest rate increase in September could trigger a strengthening of the foreign exchange rate potential in the US dollar if the balance sheet reduction program is not expected.
In general, this situation could trigger car sales in the short-term index of the upcoming developing country (GOÜ) with a high potential for excess imports, noting that "the most important thing is what the ECB will say".
After the July meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi, the ECB's policy-making body, expressed a desire to discuss the euro in a more open and open way, which led to the euro/dollar parity rising to 1,1700 levels.
Therefore, the announcement that the monthly 60 billion euro savings programme will be reduced or can be signed would mean that post-Fed liquidity on a global scale will also be reduced by the ECB.
"So, in countries with high foreign exchange reserves and foreign direct investment, such as Turkey, negative price trends may occur on the markets". he said.
Gedik Yatırım Investment Advisory Board Director Erol Gürcan da Kasım said in November 2016 that after the election of Trump as President of the United States, there was a fairly serious rally in global stock markets.
Gürcan, the key driver behind this rally, said it was possible to say that the key elements that triggered the rally were improvements that boosted global growth expectations, including Trump's early tax cuts and tax cuts.
The Istanbul Stock Exchange and the global rally were at the top of the list.
While one of the main reasons for this is that the BIST 100 index has been relatively weak compared to similar emerging market markets in recent years, it is worth noting that the steps taken by policymakers to support economic and financial markets have played a serious role.
In particular, we can say that the index of the Credit Guarantee Fund (KGF), which became active in March, has had a serious impact on the rise observed so far.
Gürcan, who noted that in the rest of the year, positive developments were significantly reflected in price movements and that KGF, which played a key role in this rise, was gradually reaching maturity, said that while the BIST 100 index remains relatively quiet compared to similar country markets, a new story search for the rest of the year may gradually emerge.
Gürcan said that the 180-day action plan, which is expected to be shared for some time, the increase in the limit of the Credit Guarantee Fund, the regulatory arrangements to support corporate profits, and possible tax deductions on the recent agenda could contribute positively to this.
Stressing that the fact that the major developed country central banks such as Gürcan, the Fed, the ECB and the UK's Central Bank (BoE) will gradually tighten up their existing expansionary policy positions and that they are among the critical risk elements for developing countries, he said that "the very high probability that the Fed, which continues to make modest interest-rate investments, will begin a balance sheet shrinkage process after September, the possibility that the ECB will shortly be closing its stock transfer programme and the BOE will be the key developments to be followed in this regard".
Gürcan said that the 104,150-104,600 support zone, which corresponds to the upward trend since the beginning of the year, was very critical in the upcoming index possible correction movements, and that the support zone could continue to reach the levels of 101,700, 100,000, 99,200 respectively, if this support zone is broken.
Gürcan said that in the current upward trend and the current historical peak of 108,605 resistance levels, the index could rise to 110,000-112,000.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldiers were killed in a suicide attack.
According to officials, a suicide bomber in the Afghan capital of Kabul attacked a military convoy, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
In a NATO statement, he said five soldiers and one translator were wounded.
Local sources, who have not been identified, say three civilians have died in the incident in Karabağ.
The bombing in Afghanistan has been a source of violence; on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a suicide bombing in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In a NATO statement, the Afghan army said in a statement that the attack was carried out with "personnel-guided, el-made explosive" in a joint deployment with the Afghan army on Thursday evening.
In a statement, all the injured were said to be in good condition and undergoing treatment at a US military hospital in Bagram, Hawaii.
The correspondent says the Taliban's growing power and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh are an important source of food for NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in the first half of 2017, Afghanistan, with an average of 20 percent in the capital, witnessed at least 1,662 civilian deaths.
At the end of July, a suicide car bombing in the predominantly Shiite region of Kabil'in killed at least 30 people.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people in a deadly militant attack on the country after US-led forces ousted the Taliban in 2001.
In his speech, President Donald Trump stressed the unstable security situation in Afghanistan, while stressing the importance of US President Donald Trump's emphasis on increasing the number of US troops helping the country with military and police assistance.
The Muhabirler says the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have created a crisis in the government, its policies and especially the camouflage of confidence in President Ashraf Ghani's position.
EPA, after litigation, refused to comply with the Clean Air Act.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency, an Obama-sponsored agency, returned a day later from a decision to overturn a law requiring states to curb emissions of pollutants, with 15 state organizations suing the initiative.
Earlier on Wednesday, the EPA said it was determined to work with the states and announced its decision to continue with the "Ozone Regulations 2015".
EPA President Scott Pruitt said in a statement, "We believe in dialogue with our state partners and in being sensitive to them".
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA's intention to reduce its ozone emissions by one year until October 2018; these decrees measure the current pollution from the pollutant in various parts of the country and determine where the pollutant must be removed to meet stricter air quality standards.
Fifteen states and the District of Columbia, which are largely Democrats, filed a lawsuit Tuesday claiming that the effort was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump continues its quest to recover the wide-ranging environmental regulations enacted by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump calls "enhancing economic growth".
But these efforts have sparked a backlash from Democrats and conservative groups concerned about the public health impact of more emissions.
According to the EPA's website, ozone-containing air solutions "can reduce liver function and increase symptoms of asthma".
Orman is the preacher of the verdict...
Sıra stoper ve kanat transferinde!
Beşiktaş President Fiktrret Orman, Dutch footballer Jeremain Lens and the stoper transfer made statements to Bein Sports.
Fiktrret Orman said the following...
Transferde bir surprise is not.
Our goal is not a transfer, but a point play.
Now we will make a beer stoper and a canat transfer.
We have Champions League matches, hopefully we can have a good ball.
We have to make the transfer of Mecburen sails.
10 million euros is easy, but we don't have that kind of budget.
If it comes to our budget, we will transfer, or we will die.
Without networking, information about lenses is impossible.
We are a publicly traded company.
The end of patience is peace.
Is the threat of ISIL only for the festival of var for August 30?
Ankara's governor's reaction to the banning of concert events including the oturma eylemi, anma toplantısı and benzeri tüm toplu events during the month of August on the grounds of "ISİD threats" continues.
The decision to ban validity included the phrase "all toplu events", while the 7th in Ankara.
The International Festival of the Grand Ankara is still going on.
In a statement issued by the SÖZCÜ, CHP Group Vice President and Ankara Deputy Prime Minister Levent Gök said that "the impact of the 30 August ban on the country cannot be considered in this case", adding:
There was a lot of confusion.
In the case of the validity and validity of the decision to implement...
The Devtrletin's mission is to create spaces for the celebration of holidays.
CHP Ankara Milletvekili Murat Emir de "Tüm Ankara has a security concern, only Gökçek'in organizations do not have a security concern".
Ankara's Independent Millettrvekili Aylin Nazlıaka also carried the ban to the Meclis.
Nazlıaka, who responded to the Prime Minister's request, suggested, "Does this ban not clearly show the AKP's hostility towards the republic and Atatürk? How do you plan to stop the millions who will be gathering in the areas on 30 August?"
"I learned from Edwina that I was changed personally".
Ibrahim Kutluay and Demettr Şener, whose divorce case is ongoing, had been with his lawyer Aslı Hatemi and Nişantaşı the day before.
In a lawsuit for damages, Edwina Sponza'ya, who claims to have bought her daughter, filed a suit for damages, alleging that she had filed court-ordered photos of Şener, Sponza and Kutluay together.
Sponza was convicted of the crime of "Demet, illegally exchanged my private photographs".
'YEMİN EDERİM BİLMİYORDUM' is also known as 'YEMİN EDERİM BİLMİYORDUM'.
After this recent development, Şener, who met with his lawyer Nişantaşı Delicatessen'de buluş, the newspapermen appeared to be out of the mecca.
Very happy, Ştrener laughed, remembering Edwina Sponza's claim about the photos, saying "Allah Allah, I have a good idea".
Aslı Hatemi de Spontrza's complaint "There was such a complaint or its content is not correct".
"Everything is gone; we are going to court", he said.
Ştrener, the newspaper's "In recent times everyone has a billion dollars in your relationship with your spouse Sponza".
"How could you not know?" he asked in astonishment.
What is Netryi?
How?
"I swear I didn't know", said Şener, "should I be thrown into the garden with my husband or with my mother?"
When the journalists insisted on "Didn't you hear me?" Şener, who first said "No", continued: "I didn't, of course I heard it the first time".
But I never believed in such a thing.
Everything was normal, right, there was nothing to suspect.
Hanımefendi, I have learned all of this since you sent me everything, so I just...
Şener, who responded to the cry "Evet" "Was it Sponza who sent the deliverables?" with the court-appointed photos and correspondence, confused himself, claiming that Sponza had sent them to him personally.
Sponza, who had previously claimed that his correspondence with Ibrahim Kutluay was a montage.

Qatar: We broke through thanks to Turkey in the Ambargoyu saatler.
Qatar's Minister of Economy and Trade Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani expressed his gratitude to the Turkish people.
Al Thani: "I thank you very much for your respect and support for us".
I extend my greetings to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the Emirate of Qatar.
The Qatari economist Direniştrini has spat out.
The economies of many countries have been adversely affected and our economy is in a stable state.
We must do our best to ensure Qatar's independence and stability.
Thanks to Turkey, we broke a huge orange in the amber during the sack against us.
At present, we are not in any way in any way in the wrong.
The natural resources we have, and the exports of natural gas, have been a major contributor to Qatar's economy.
Thanks to Turkey's cruel treatment and crackdown on laws, we were not affected.
Today Qatar is once again continuing to produce natural gas and LNG worldwide.
"After the events, we saw a 30 percent increase in natural gas emissions, not a decrease", he said.
Noting that the brotherly relations between Qatar and Turkey and work in all areas is ongoing, Al Thani said, "The first quarter of the trade volume in Aramiz amounted to a whopping $554 million".
In recent times, the role of the central government has played a significant role.
The rapid introduction of Turkish goods into all sectors, as well as investment in many areas, is of great importance to us as a result of the success of Turkish products in the market in Qatar.
"I thank you very much for your constructive attitude towards us", he said.
The cost of Sontr afetler is 300 million TL.
TSB President Can Akın Çağlar, pointing out that after the July 18 cell strike, insurance companies received 7 losses of 116 million TL, the Gökova earthquake of 21 July received 12 million 800 liras, and the July 27 Istanbul cell strike brought 168 million liras 22 billion liras, the last three events reported the insurance costs of 300 million liras.
Çağlar, "In terms of castration insurance, the damage caused by the dolunun is a carport loss of 3 bin 500 lira per vehicle, while the loss is bin lira civarında".
"The average loss of the depreciation is 6 billion lira", he said.
Stressing that they have made a strong effort as a sector to compensate for economic losses, Cantr Akın Çağlar, stating that none of the 4 persons 3 have insurance, one of the 2 businesses has no fire insurance and the 3 persons 2 have no helmet insurance, said: "The risk of natural disasters due to climate change is increasing".
Due to the low insurance rate in Ülkemiz, the risk of our citizens and institutions facing serious losses is increasing day by day.
All of the budgetary expenses should not be left to the state.
Insurance policies are not as expensive as they are, and insurance is not only a loss-making sector; it also provides risk management consulting.
Increasing the insurance bilinc and the rate of insurance coverage is very important for our people and our country.
Cantr Akın Çağlar, "In the general conditions of the Kasko insurance company, insured persons are required to report their losses within 5 working days, and this period ended yesterday".
"Will the victim be a smoker?" the shooter replied, "If there is such a time under general conditions, the Ticaret Act extends the time limit to two years".
"This is also a natural disaster, so there is no need for insurers to panic, no company is paying demez", he said.
This is how the German media dev ihaletryi saw it!
It is worth noting that, at a time when the tensions between Turkey and Germany are increasing, German Siemens has won the first Rüzgar Enerjisi Renewable Enerji Kaynak Alanları (YEKA) in Turkey.
The German media reported this development with the words "Dev ihaleyi German Siemens in Turkey won".
DWelle Türkçe, YEKA's head of sales, reported the victory of the Siemens-Türkerler-Kalyon consortium, saying: "The consortium will invest over $1 billion in wind farms".
The company's 8' from 2'ye index today, when it was faced by Chinese Mingyang and German Siemens consortia, was described as "the first YEKA to be a turbine powered by the wind power capacity of bin megawatts", using the words "the turbine is opening up to create wind power capacity, and it carries the characteristics of being the first YEKA turbine in Turkey".
Enerji and Tabii Kaynaklar, who made a statement after İhaleden, made striking remarks on Turkey-Germany relations.
İtrhale, the result of the acquisition of German company Siemens, is an official message to the region and the world.
Looking at the 200 years of historical cooperation between Turkey and Germany, I think this will make a significant contribution to Turkey-Germany relations.
I am very proud to show that Turkey is the leader of the region and the world's most reliable investment country, no matter how regional the world may be.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomtrachenko meet for the first time, meeting a possible date.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are on their way to a near-future boxing match for 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
The World Boxing Council briefly met with cycling champion Garcia, who walked the corridor and was the World Boxing Organization super-haired cycling champion Lomachenko until he was killed at ESPN's offices in Los Angeles.
Showtime and Saturday voted in unison, following Garcia's defeat of former four-cycle world champion Adrien Broner, the two cyclists fought unprecedentedly between the five teams.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
"You have a good chance".
Lomachenko, the host of the game, Miguel Marriaga'ya, will play against the team on Saturday night at 7pm ESPN'de savunacak.
While posing for photos, Lomochenko's manager Egis Klimar noted that a potential match between the fighters would be "the perfect size".
Garcia, who made the reminder "Ben is an old birtrüy cyclet".
"I went up for Broner but I'm not that big.
My little one for 140tr.
I want to have a lightweight inmek.
If we can get through the lightweight cyclette (135 pounds), then we can fight.
This is what the fans want.
Let's make it easy for them".
Lomtrachenko was killed.
"Boksun needs this fight".
Klimas said it should be 'odé ve izle'de mi; Garcia'yla (37-0, 30 nakavt) had a date set and Lomachenko was part of his strategy to fight in a 135 pound opening match this year; Garcia and Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell were probably interested in fighting for the lightweight cyclet title at the 23 September Forum.
Garcia said, "Dövüştröde ve izle'de can be because all the supporters want it". and later stated which channel this financial package offers would be open to him.
Biztr such a name.
No other name has generated such interest.
They are never ready to...tr"
Garcia Lomachenko'yu said he appreciated the "true bir dövüşçü" and said he could attend Saturday's match.
But Lomachenko, Garcia's ball-outs were thwarted by the practice and said he thought the three-cycle champion from Riverside looked "too slow", "so bad, Mikey...nakvtı sen istedin".
Garcia said the room was first to show his yumruk strength, then boxing.
Both said they felt the momentum was being created for their encounters.
"This is a fight that needs to be done.
No other fight has generated so much interest and rumor.
"I'm very happy to be working on this", Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I was waiting for Mikey and Ben in the fight.
It's going to be a great fight".
Russia and the United States remained Turktr.
Beyaz Saray is not considering sanctions that would affect Moscow's pipeline construction, but sanctions against Russia could increase the cost of those pipelines.
This is because of the increasing debt-to-equity ratio.
Worried that its investment partners in Batı would consider withdrawing from the projects due to sanctions, the Kremlin, in turn, hastened the construction of pipelines.
The Turkish railway line, which is planned to be built by the Swiss company Allseas Group, is being built on the lines of Gazprom.
Reuters reported that Gazprom has begun construction of a second pipeline parallel to the "aceyl" Türk Akımı to export more gas to Europe.
The new results of the Swedish test for age-approval have been announced.
In Sweden, a new method of evaluating medical age or the final results of the evaluation tests of refugees, more than 80 percent of the test participants decided that they were over the age of 18, but not everyone was confident in the validity of these tests.
The Swedish National Adlitr Tıp ve İlaç Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) has begun to make its tests even more accurate this year.
The Testler was designed to make the age assessment more accurate during the iltica process after some refugees claiming to be underage were criticized for failing to assess the correct age of some refugees.
To date, Migration Agency has sent out 6880 vacancies for testing and Adli Tıp and İlaç Adresi have released the results of the current tests for the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent of the people (2002 adedinin) were 18 or over, while 25 percent of the people were Adli Tıp ve İlaç Dairesi who ruled that the person was "probably 18 or over".
The 432th result was that the person was "probably under 18'in".
The test is only performed in cases where the age of the person is suspect.
According to Adli Tıp ve İlaç Directorate'nden Johan Göransson, the results are consistent with past months.
"We don't see much difference in the statistics from the previous year, the numbers are fairly consistent", said The Local.
The high rate of cases in which the age of 18 or older is determined does not mean that refugees are lying about their ages.
In May, the 581st District Court explained the results of the tests and said that "some people have been shown to be 18 years of age or older" with 442 cases.
When the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper analyzed the results of 581 candidates, it found that 243 candidates had publicly declared their 18th birthday this year.
Medical age assessment methods, which include taking X-rays of 20-year-old teeth and MRI scans of the dental exclements, and then analyzing them to dentists and radiologists, are criticized in some circles.
One of the researchers, Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institutet, evaluated the biological maturity of people who had studied the blue age earlier or later than normal.
"I have reasons to think about it and I think that this should not be the kind of measurement used.
It is highly questionable to make such a decision on the biological age.
If we can say it with certainty, we must pretend to do it", he told Metro.
In fact, Adlitr Tıp ve İlaç Dairesi'nden Göransson defended the validity of the tests: "You can say that the risk of a child being misjudged as an adult is generally low.
The greatest risk is that a person is under the age of 18, in which case the risk is around 10 percent".
Yıldız Hamidiye Camisi is opening a meeting today.
The Yıldız Hamidiye Camisi, built by Abdülhamit in 1885 by architect Nikolaidis Jelpuylo'ya, will be inaugurated today with Friday prayer after restoration work.

Battrı Virginia has announced that it will change the party's portfolio.
West Virginia Democratic governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night that he would change parties at a meeting with President Trump.

Meanwhile, the Cumhuriyetçi Ulustral Kongre on Thursday evening issued a statement saying that "the change of party of the Justice Department is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is willing to work to prevent it from re-enlarging the country rather than to make it bigger".
RNC spokeswoman Rtronna McDaniel told CBS's verdict, "History has only 15 valid valid and in a small number of states the legislature is under control, the Vali Justice's ministry is one of leadershipless and positive, and a message of conversion that the party is only one of its own surrender".

The Turkcell Districts are the best.
Turkcell's Deputy General Manager İsmail Bütün said that Yasmani Capello believes that London will be a success, saying, "We sincerely believe that Yasmani will represent our flag and championship in a better way".
We wish our athletes who will compete in London success.
"We will continue to support the further development of Turkish athletics and bring greater achievements to our country", he said.
Coe apologized for his "similar" wishes for Russia's doping scandal.
World athletics patron Sebastian Coe praised Russia's apology for the doping scandal, which it described as "serious", but stressed that the vaccine was not appropriate for the country's re-admission of the sport.
Russia's athletics patron Dmitry Shylakhtin, at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics, said that the country's sporting achievements were correct and that it was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all athletes who have been forcibly stripped of their gold and silver medals in competitions".
In response to his own assessment, the IAAF Congress voted in November 2015 to extend the ban after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
IAAF President Coe Trader told reporters, "Today I think it is very samimi bir jawa, very samimi bir sunum".
"All the council and all the congress were pleased... that the Russian Federation had accepted it, that it had overcome its troubled days, and that it had done everything possible to ensure the reorganization of the federation"...
Coe said that Russia was "remiss" that it accepted the re-admission criteria.
"I think it's a very productive day and I think it's being passed, but Congress is supporting the task force's proposal that it's not the right time to give up Russia's rights", Coe said.
"We must do everything we can to normalize this situation within a few months.
"It has always been a way of distinguishing clean athletes from the system".
Ninety-nine Russian athletes who meet the IAAF criteria will compete as neutral at the World Championships in Athletics, which begins in London on Friday.
IAAF task force chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still does not meet many criteria for the eligibility of its rights.
After a meeting of the IAAF Council in London, the IAAF told reporters that the drug test was inadequate and that illegal trainers were working freely.
The news of the US's 'YPG'trye tank' lies.
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) Ankara Büyükelçilitrği, Syria, has announced that no tank has been delivered to any of the warring parties.
Claims that the YPG had sent hundreds of tanks and weapons were denied.
The statement by Eltrçilik, entitled "Explanation on the false news in the press about the Syrian refugees", said:
A series of false reports in the press in recent days have been falsely claimed that the US and the YPG have sent hundreds of tanks and artillery to Syria to provide support.
In this report, some basic facts about the current situation in Syria are ignored.
The US has disguised any tank group fighting against Suriyede Deaşa.
The United States, which provides a large part of its military aid primarily with light weapons and mortars, supports elements of the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAK) within the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG).
The Syrian Araplar, who are fighting to clear the region and reunite with their families, are now in the process of being evacuated.
President Ertrmut TYDTA: Foreign direct investment will be higher than last year.
TYDTA President Artrda Ermut said that 55 percent of all investment in the past year came after July.
15 July FETÖ's coup attempt led to no investment boom, but rather a surge in investment, with actor Ermut saying, "Maybe there would be more boom, and then there would be more".
Perhaps without these conditions, without some regional improvements, we could see a further increase in the spread effect.
Therefore, we are hoping for more for the coming year.
In the future, it will be a brighter year in terms of direct investment.
In the first five months of the year, we have seen an 11 percent increase compared to the first five months of last year.
But we're not doing enough of that.
"We hope it will be more". they used the phrase.
"It's not just global, regional or regional developments that are making a difference", Ermut said, stressing that they are trying to diversify investors.
Ertrmut, recalling that by 2010 75% of direct investment would normally come from Europe, continued:
This figure fell to 66 percent.
Again, Asia's share increased from 2 percent to 7-8 percent.
Russia's influence has increased.
While we tried to do this, some problems arose among the Gulf states themselves.
Turkey has good relations with all of them; especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar are two important players.
But the problem between these two countries is still a bit more troubling and at the same time, it makes investors reluctant to make decisions.
Not only in the sense of Turkey's investors, but we may be experiencing some setbacks as a result.
Arda Ermut recalled that there were some incidents in Germany last week, or that the government, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had reacted so forcefully and decisively.
When speaking to investors in countries experiencing political crisis, President Erdoğan responded, "There are problems between governments, there are certainly not between peoples".
Second, these people came and invested in my country.
These are no different for us than Turkish companies.
When there are any small or complex problems, they will come to us and we will solve them.
Expressing his "we will certainly not allow them to suffer", Ermut said that the family was comfortable with this and that they continued to support all investors.
Ertrmut, "We can guarantee that in the future".
You will see that neither German companies nor investors from countries where we have some political problems in any way will have some problems.
In the meantime, I hope we will eliminate the investment and increase in these countries.
We believe that investment from Burtrada will continue to grow.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect perceptions of the investment environment.
"But we will do our best at this point, and we will do everything possible to avoid being affected by the target, not only by our investors but also by the perception of the investment environment".
Turkey's President Ertrmut TYDTA said that after the tek kuşak tek yol strategy Turkey has started to take a strong interest in China, but if the problems in the Gulf are resolved and large investments are expected from the Gulf.
"In our relations with Germany, there is not a single investor who says, 'We have suffered from these relations, we have had investments because of this incident, we are fleeing,'" Ermut, using his own words, noted that there were companies coming, coming and going and they followed.
Ermut, "We have about 10 percent of our portfolio of projects in German companies".
So of the companies we interviewed around the world, almost 10 percent are German companies.
Some of these are companies that already have investments in Turkey.
Adam's investment in the area of the project was not a problem, but we were open to it as a project.
"So German companies are actually a big part of our daily workflow", he said.
Emphasizing the need for all state institutions to be cautious during times when Turkey's intelligence operations are being carried out, Ermut said the issue was sensitive and could be affected by a slightly poor communication.
Ermut, pointing out that the past 2-3 weeks have been a good lesson, commented:
Investors and politicians have different agendas.
We have always seen that economic relations always lead to political developments in some way.
Germany will continue to be our important trading partner and important investor.
Because there are still a lot of investments in Turkey right now.
The electoral agenda in Germany is increasingly rife with such rhetoric.
And as they're going through, I think these things will work out a little bit better.
Saudi Arabia, in particular, is careful not to make negative statements.
Nettricede, an investor who invests in Turkey, is investing in markets of all surrounding countries.
So, not because of Saudi Arabia, but because of the uncertainty in the region, the process slowed down a bit.
But we are still in talks with these investors.
In my personal opinion, investors are waiting for a decision that they can perhaps make faster.
'In a negative sense, I see uncertainty due to the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, I'm getting out of here,' said our Saudi investor.
There are also Saudi investors who continue to live in Turkey, where we are doing a tour and we are meeting, following all the processes.
Arda Ermut, recalling that last year international direct investment (UDY) into Turkey was $12.3 billion, said, "I think we will definitely go beyond that this year.
"But how far we go, these regional developments, global uncertainties will affect us".
While hoping that the normal spread effect will be higher, perhaps a little more limited, Ermut noted that the rate of growth was 11 percent in the first 5 months, indicating that this could be corrected, stating, "I hope that if there is no bad development, I believe that we will definitely get better off this year than last year".
He also said that a significant part of the investments made will continue to be real estate, indicating that new investments could be made in logistics, healthcare, fintech, business, petrochemical, food, energy and manufacturing.
Emphasizing that there will be new investors to be announced in the coming months, Ermut said, "In the near future, an investment in the sense of 'imlat' may be announced".
Not a billion dollars or a huge investment.
"Interested countries may be investors". it was assessed.
4 litres of wine to a firm 9 ilde operation: 55 detained
The team of the Mücadele Şube Müdireköy, together with the İstanbul Kaçakçılık Suçları, found that the long and loose mantar tapayi kapatan folyo capla on the products sold by 4 wine companies did not stick the bandrolls to the bottle, the TAPDK bandrolls glued to the capla were collected after the sale of the products and were marketed as newly produced wines.
The team of oltris argued that the state lost 20 million 400 billion lira in tax revenue due to the repeated use of bandroleri by suspects.
Police teams conducted a simultaneous operation today at 55 addresses, including the factories and warehouses of four wine companies in Istanbul, Edirne, Tekirdağ, Bursa, Balıkesir, Manisa, Aydın, Denizli and Nevşehir.
In the operation, 55 people were detained, and in the calls, 15 cans of ready-to-sell wine, 52 cans of 480 TAPDK bandrolü capüşonlu dolumu dolumu made of wine were used many times, 12 cans of 890 TAPDK bandrolü capüşon, 3 cans and mermeri, 100 cans of cinsel, 992 cans of cigars, 698 cans of various kinds of fake liquor and 100 litres of anason essence were transferred.

Security operations are underway for the suspects.
The operation of the teams' factories, warehouses and businesses was mirrored by police cameras.
During the search of a warehouse by police officers, the checkpoint was shown removing the caps on ready-to-sell wine bottles.
The bags were filled with TAPDK bandrollü caps, police equipment and were stored.
How will the financial rules of football affect Neymar's Paris trip?
Rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent Neymar from transferring the world record from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris-Saint Germaintrine, France.
With the power to keep teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament, European players can draw any kind of conclusions from UEFA's governing body, Paris Saint-Germain.
The Financial Fair Play rules, issued by UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar's transfer is financed before he loses his life.
Barcelona, for example, paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian outside of his contract alone, and Neymar would be paid tens of millions of dollars a year.
Some of the financial aspects of Neymar's French journey include:
Given the paralytic influx of his team, energy zengtrini Katarlı family, PSG will certainly be able to pay off the paralytic signatures of Neymar and his other stars in the galaxy.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to buy players, but they themselves have to pay for it with legitimate sources of income to ensure they are successful in their football-related business.
The FFP was designed by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player, who was a successful player, believed that clubs with large debts were effective gamblers and were at risk of bankruptcy if bankers or owners checked their backs.
In the 2011 FFP, instead of concentrating on the club's debts, it began to track down losses.
The change, which was first used by Roman Abramović at Chelsea in 2003, meant a more difficult transformation of the model into a more challenging one.
During the three-year FFP evaluation period, which runs until 2018, the group could suffer a loss of 30 million euros.
Although Plattrini was disgracefully removed from the presidency in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Aleksander Ceferin, was determined to give up the extreme violence.
Andrea Traverso, UEFA's FFP chairman, told the Associated Press last week: "The FFP has definitely not died and we will continue to strengthen it by moving the rules forward".
Her amount of PSG's purchase of Neymar's maddesini toplu would be payable, although for reasons of personal reasons, the contract could be extended.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the transfer fee can be shown as a cost of 44.4 million euros in the next five years' annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP players in 2014 saw the implementation of heavy demands by Manchester City, which is owned by PSG and Abu Dhabi.
PSG, which was later fined 60 million euros ($82 million at the time), was later fined 20 million euros and ordered to limit the Champions League team to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA, the owners of the clubs, and the companies connected to them through the UEFA, have also been able to change the financial regulations of the clubs.
A Qatari company sponsored by PSG is credible, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed standard market values, UEFA will not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA Qatar Tourism Authority ruled that PSG sponsorship was suspended.
It was reported that part of Neymar's income from PSG could come through payments to Qatar's 2022 World Cup organising committee.
But PSG and Qatar have denied Neymar will be the World Cup ambassador for 2022, and such a move could easily be revealed by UEFA regulators.
The previously imposed sanctions and rules by PSG mean that UEFA will be more careful about the atlatma charges.
According to the speakers, UEFA is not in a pre-emptive meeting with PSG about Neymar's transfer.
Since PSG was not authorized to discuss the situation, they spoke to The Associated Press in secret.
Recently published calculations show that PSG made a surplus of €542.4 million to €10 million in 2015-16 between now and 2016.
The accounts for the previous fiscal year have not yet been released.
PSG expects Neymar's success to contribute to sponsorship deals, gift sales and form sales.
Kultrup expects the cirron to rise at least 30 percent after being signed.
The Spanish league, which was clearly upset by the progress of one of its biggest players, tried to stop Neymar's progress by claiming that PSG had defrauded the FFP.
La Liga president Javier Tebtras told Spanish newspaper AS that Qatar is the clear owner of PSG, saying: "Bu, club ve devleti ile açık bir'mali doping' vakasıdır".
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who owns his own club, American sports devine, shares his concerns about La Liga being financed by a state.
"Bu, it's a result of the Dutchman's victory, and in the last 15 years football has completely changed the world", Wenger said on Thursday.
"When a country has a single ballot once, everything is possible.
Financial Fair Play is very difficult to respect because for a country, representing a country with such a large player can lead to different methods or interests.
The insurers' 'high price' insurgency.
According to the TSB, the insurance sector has been hurting the traffic industry since 2006.
In 2015, the sector suffered 2.35 trillion TL of losses, while in 2016 it only made 19 million TL of profits.
The stock exchange in Istanbul is trading Aksigorta, Anadolu Sigorta and Güneş Sigorta.
Speaking at the meeting where TSB assessed the results for the first six months of 2017, Çağlar said that the 11-year loss in traffic insurance reached 7.3 billion TL, the sector's loss by applying the ceiling premium this year is 2.3 billion TL, and the estimated loss-price ratio is expected to rise by 125 percent.
Saying that the figure will be captured this year and 2015, Çağlar pointed out that the losses recorded in 2012 and 2015 also took the profits of other industries, saying, "This is what it means; we are financing bad drivers by raising the price of a citizen's account policy".
"The sector is 75 percent foreign, and our foreign partners have also financed the bad driver in some way", he said.
Çağtrlar, continued:
We have not been able to show that we have made any profits in the past 11 years or even in any other year.
"While we accept that there is a reasonable harm to the environment, we hope to be able to carry it along with other policemen", he said.
Noting that traffic losses were dramatic price increases when compared to other products, Çağlar said, "Traffic insurance in 2012 saw a price increase of about 30 percent, almost doubled in 2015, and we have written down our history and our big losses".
"In an environment where prices have soared, our traffic at the end of 2016 was only 19 million TL", he said.
Saying that they expect the free tariff to be passed next year, Çağlar said, "We will lower the price of a good driver at a free tariff and apply a higher price to a bad driver".
"However, the General Treasury is keeping a general agenda, and it is not yet known when it will happen", Hazine'de said.
Hazard Insurance, stating that the increase in the premium of compulsory traffic insurance since 2015 has affected a large part of society, has moved to the application of the maximum premium (average price) from 12 Nisan.
Accordingly, the minimum requirements for the compulsory traffic insurance policies were established on the basis of the vehicle group, traffic volume and traffic density statistics and accident statistics, and the maximum requirements for the compulsory traffic insurance policies were determined on the basis of the specified groups.
In July, the "Riskli Sigortalılar Havuzu" app was launched for high-frequency crashes in high-risk traffic insurance or vehicle groups.
The primary and secondary insurance policies for traffic insurance policies in Havuz will be shared among insurance companies.
The first of these insured will be identified by the Hazardous Hazard Insurance Company.
Çağlar said that in the first six months of 2017, the production of traffic premiums in the application of the ceiling-price ratio decreased by 11.5 percent compared to the same period a year earlier, while the number of police officers increased by 4.9 percent to 8.6 million, and the reduction in traffic police in the light of inflation reached about 30 percent.
Saying that traffic will again take a toll on other industries this year, Çağlar said, "This loss cannot be sustained at such high prices.
How much more harm can this sector bear?" he said.
Saying that all companies in the sector have a capital of 9 billion TL, only 2.3 billion TL will be lost in three years when traffic is damaged, Çağlar said, "The residents are like, 'Why is a good driver financing a bad driver, why are my thousands of shareholders financing a bad driver in Turkey?'"
"We are trying to tell Haztrine'ye about our problems now", he said.
On a question about whether foreigners have come to the point of reducing the burden in the Turkish insurance sector after these developments, Çağlar said, "They have not yet come to that point".
Turkey expects to invest more because the Netherlands has an average of six police officers per capita, compared to 1.3 per capita in Turkey.
"So Turkey is a place to grow in the real sense", he said, adding:
So they didn't give up on this.
But even though the company earns a reasonable profit every year, it uses all of the profits to grow the company.
According to the TSB, the sector's primary output in 2016 was 40.5 billion TL, up 12 percent from the same period last year in the first half of this year to 23.1 billion TL.
Çağlar said he predicted that the sector would not complete the year with a 15 percent growth in total primary production.
Thousands of chronicles have been published in social aid news.
The details and implementation principles of the "New Social Aid Programme for Families in the Eden Valley", which recently began work under the direction of Family and Social Policy Minister Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, have been revealed.
From the social assistance program to be launched for poor citizens and families, 4 bin 300 tuberculosis and SSPE hastası will benefit in the first phase.
Patients receive up to two-thirds of their minimum wage, as well as regular psychosocial support for health.
The ministry will also pay for the treatment of patients with tuberculosis who have been diagnosed with medical problems, who are dependent on their bed, or who have health problems related to the need to improve their living conditions.
Ötrdemeler will be provided via PTT via Social Assistance Cards.
Those who go to withdraw for reasons such as geographical conditions, illness, or poor health will be paid in advance.
The program, in many respects, has the distinction of being the first of its kind in the world.
Ten of the firms that will invest are still German.
Arda Ermut, the head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry's Turkey Yattrırım Destek and Tanıtım Agency, said that the political war between the two countries does not reflect the business world, as German firms in Turkey are seen as Turkish firms.
Ermut, "In German-language relations, one investor said, 'We are running from this situation, we are suffering from this situation.'
Ermut, "The future portfolio of projectors is about 10 percent of German companies".
Some of them have investments in Turkey.
"Germans are an important part of our daily workflow", he said.
Ermut, the Abraaj Group's partner in the logistics company Netlog, said that this is a good example.
Abraaj Group Partner Omar Sytred, pointing to economic growth in Turkey, said, "We have invested a total of $1 billion in Turkey".
Ötrzer, on his way to becoming Son Osmanlı.

The transfer of Yüzyıl has taken place!
Barcelona have announced that Neymar is transferred to Paris Saint-Germain for 222 million euros.
The transfer development that has been followed by the excitement of the football club in recent times has been officially revealed.
PSG, the Brazilian player, has been awarded 222 million euros, the player's free-to-play price, to the Catalan team.

The strike of Deniztreniz workers has ended.
The company İzmir Büyükşehir Belediyesi's İZDENİZ A.Ş. and Türk-İş'e are the two largest contractors in Turkey, Turkey Denizciler Sendikası (TDS), which has been linked to the Turkish-İş.
In response, the workers' union İZDENİZ, a union affiliate, went on strike on July 12.
A strike lasting almost a year, after the workers were forced to work, ended today at 15.00.
According to the contract signed by the toplu, the wages of the employees of İZDENİZ will be reduced by 12 percent.
The rate of pay for personnel with the status of seaman increased by 25 percent of their salaries, along with the Gelir Vergisi allowance, obtained after the signing of the newly-formed İZDENİZ'in, the International Gemi Sicilian, and the salary of the sailor increased by 5 percent.

Improvements were made to the strike card and to our workers working at sea.
We are suddenly leaving the monastery.
The average cebine working at Denizde will be 28 percent, while the karada will be 20 percent.
We had friends who worked for the lowest wages.
We have made significant improvements in their salaries as well.
Nostalji, "Istrlak Sıcak Amerikan Yazı" and "Yoldaş Dedektif" were written by Niş Oluyor.
For example, for the characters' glittering 80s days, for the grunge era of the 90s (when brains like David Wain and Michael Showalter did the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV) and for themselves, i.e. 2001, before their stars Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went on to bigger things, the story's buzz version is nostalgic for all of them.
As a cultural product, it is always remembered as the reinvention and embodying of our Facebook era.
But as a series, it seems like the franchise is out of date.
"The First Day of the Campaign" was an unexpected success, and it wasn't just because of the absurd joke (in addition, there was a story about the origins of a box of talking plants voiced by H. Jon Benjamin.)
Focusing mainly on comedy (playing teenage children by older actors or actresses) made it impossible to recapture the past part of the joke.
Paradoxes are more casual, including the now-adult-played "Ten Years Later" with less emotional content and monologues about the 90s sequel film Beşiği Sallayan El.

There is also another crazy plan that has been pushed by George H. W. Bush (a perfectly well-placed one by Michael Ian Black) and that Ronald Reagan (just Bay Showalter) has been involved in.
As usual, the serinin is in this part of the words.
It's especially nice to see Matt Dillon's "Bekarlar" always young Mr. Rudd, who has six beards, and his old school and popular kid Andy, who now looks like a moruk.
This series can be a thrilling, random moment of delight (like a sort of repeat of the "Seven Up!" series) until I reach what I think is the logical conclusion: "Islak Sıcak Amerikan Yazı: Twenty Years Later", which in the final scene ensures that the friend class goes to see the opening of the movie "Islak Sıcak Amerikan Yazı".
Meanwhile, the Amazon "Yoldaş Dedektif" is referring to a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of Soğuk Savaş of "The Americans", the film "Sarışın Bomba" and even the iconographic "GLOW" against the Batı güreşine of Doğu, Batı güreşine.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, Rhys Thomas's directorial comedy, it looks like a TV-made show: a 1980's Romanian police buddy drama about two Bükreşli police officers fighting for the real, atheistic and Marxist-Leninist path.

Like Gülen, Gulâm Ahmed's de imperialistes en sevilen viewpoint is that "cihad" is a struggle that Muslims are only waging with their own selves and that there is no boycott to be fought against if imperialism is allowed to live in religious freedom.
In fact, if you remember Gülen went a step further, even praising the attacks of the Haçlıs, whose wounds in our history are still open, in a 'vaz' last year, he said: "The occupation of Haçlı's homeland is not very dangerous.
Because there are red lines between you and them.
Once they are attached to your wife, your daughter.
Mabtredinze is a disgrace, a disgraced Haçlılar!
The idea that Mehdi and mesihilik are united in themselves, the idea that his own community will be the savior of Islam, the concept of jihad as a mere self-defense, the similarity of the theses to FETÖ, the spread of Kadyanism in general, has been realized in the field of education and civil society.
The total number of Kadyan centers in the world, which is said to have over 2 million 'Tabî's', is 1869, according to the official number of countries registered by the humanitarian organization Humanity First as 23.
There are also 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 dispensaries in 55 countries, 8 printers in Africa alone; 505 training centers in 11 countries and around 16,000 camelry and verilers worldwide.
Given that the Nobel Prize-winning "ilk Muslim scientist" Prof. Abdüsselam, the former President of the United Nations Court of Justice Sir Zaferullah Han'in, the "ilk Oscar-winning Muslim actor" Mahershala Ali de Kadıyânî, we can see more clearly the depth of global power's support for Kadıyânî.
Let's not imagine that the Kadyradian meeting last week with 30,000 people in the UK was touted as a one-man show.
One of the slogans of the Kadyanis, "Herkesi sevin, nobody hates", is enough to understand what it actually means to "love your oppressors/colonialists".
The origin and motivation of such organizations as Hütrlasa, FETÖ or Tahir-ül Kadri can be traced back to the Kadyanis, and all of these organizations are in fact supporting the overthrow of imperialism and the subjugation of societies in order to serve colonialism.
The cargo "my desire" came out.

Barış Yarkadaş said that many programs at TRT, where 6 bin 760 personnel work, are being carried out out and the prices are being paid.
The CHP'li deputy, "TRT 2016" and the millin taxpayers again appealed to AKP companies".

The official response to the request of CHP Istanbul Millettrvekili Barış Yarkadaş's Bill of Rights Bill of Rights has highlighted how TRT's resources are being spent.
Yarkadaş, of TRT, where 6 billion 760 people work as staff, said that despite all the technical possibilities, 753 million 500 million TL were transferred to the allied companies in 2016 through programs made under the name of external production.
CHP'li vekiltr, "Bunun meaningı vurgundur" used the phrase.
Barış Yarkadaş, "The production companies of the AKP journalists and businessmen are looting TRT and its assets".
"It is not known whether Izlenmeyen or Çekilip withdrew or not", he said, "and millions of people are borrowing from unknown producers".
Recalling that the money transferred to the companies was collected from the people's contributions, Yarkadaş said, "The 7 thousand-strong Kurum has returned to the AKP's four-man squad".
"Bu companyler, what programs did 7 billion people sign up for and get this money?" he shouted.
Explaining that TRT's advertising revenue in 2016 was 224,456,182 TL, Yarkadaş said that the advertising revenue was devede kulak when the salaries of staff and other expenses were taken into account.
Yarkadaş, "TRT, which has become the AKP's seat, does not receive advertising because it is not published".
Besleme newspapermen are paying for TRT'den, shouting for the AKP.
"Yukuni is a millettryor", he said.
CHP'trli Yarkadaş continued: "TRT personnel pay an annual salary of 660 million TL; or they give all their work to outsiders".
753.5 trillion yen were withdrawn from the TRT'den, the people's budget.
This is a very good thing.

The Bank of England will reduce interest rates by 0.25%.
The Bank of England is expected to announce soon that interest rates will remain unchanged, after reducing speculation that slow economic growth and inflation will increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue "yavaş" due to the decline in household income and the steady maintenance of interest rates.
The Bank's Parasal Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep the failure at 0.25%; thus, it wanted less growth after the slow economic growth had weakened its support for growth.
The Bank, in its quarterly inflation report, has revised its growth forecasts from 1.7 percent in 2017 to 1.6 percent in 2018, and warned that the country's population's income will continue to fall as inflation is expected to rise to close to 3 percent.
However, he said interest rate increases were a necessary sign to deflect the inflation triggered by Brexit over the next few years and that borrowing costs could be higher than expected in financial markets.
Ütryeler also used part of the massive economic development package launched a year ago following Brexit to push back.
The bank will sign the Dönemsel Fontrlama Plan, a low-cost financing scheme, starting next February, but said it expects to raise an additional £15 billion (totalling £115 billion) under the plan.
Minutes after the interest rate decision was taken, the Bank said: "The MPC's central bank, the Gayri safi yurt iç hasıla (GSYH), is slowly continuing to operate in the short term as the flow of reel income continues to be a burden on consumption".
As for Faizler, he stressed that "a certain amount of parallax in parallax politics" may be necessary to slow inflation and that the market will be "a little higher than expected".
The market forecasts that the first increase will occur in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank is insisting that any transaction will be "adam adım" and "simplified".
According to the May forecast, the bank's forecast for this year's and next year's declining growth is compared at 1.9 percent and 1.7 percent.
The 2018 bank's forecast is 1.8 trillion.
Sterling, after the news, lost its value against the dollar and euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to US$1.31 and the euro fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to change the decision came after GSYH's disappointment with the three previous quarters' 0.3% growth rate compared to the second quarter came after the growth figures of the last three quarters had eased many of the growth expectations.
Growth is likely to be 0.3% in the third quarter, but the bank said it will start to show a slight increase towards the end of the year.
The Bank, while saying the situation will worsen before the reforms, in its inflation report, leaves the people of the Han people, who are being hit by rising inflation and low wage increases, with little to no chance of recovery.
The Bank said that monetary policy would "not allow income to flow" over the next few years, but expects the three-year salary forecasts to "substantially" improve towards the end.
The weak pound resulting in a stronger British economy will support the economy by reducing some of the consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the shock of the AB referendum vote, which brought the pound down, caused a fall of 0.25 percent of the August vote.
The Bank estimates that this will likely take four years to fully affect prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's decision on the final interest rate, there was a rise in inflationary pressure on the people of Zordaki hane and a rise in interest rate inflation by the three policymakers' call for a 0.5% interest rate increase.
Inflation has fallen from 2.9% to 2.6%, but the bank said it was expected to rise again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the target of the two percent target was to "really" refer to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in interest rates, the business of lenders and the positive closure of the bank, the mortgage market will once again become more competitive.
In the real estate market, the current contracts seem to be getting better for the foreseeable future, with many free options and low interest rates becoming more popular than ever".
The NHS will produce 10,000 controversial HIV drugs.
In the Yüksek Mahkemde, after a struggle with funding for the NHS, patients with 'dönüştürücü' HIV prevention treatment will be able to access it from the end of the month.
NHS England has announced that a three-year trial of PrEP, a single dose taken six months ago, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 per cent, will provide healthcare services with approximately 10,000 patients through a three-year trial.
The Supreme Court's ruling last year upheld the trial's funding after the Temyiz Court's ruling that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite claims by local authorities that it was financed.
The hamle, announced on Thursday, was met with a'very serious intervention' by Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'dönüm noktası'.
The population of the sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first registered clinicians, with the participation of more clinics in the scheme, and will be fully implemented across the UK by April 2018.
PrEP (preventive prevention) has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV capma by a number of HIV medications.
Dentremeler showed that PrEP'in significantly reduced HIV transmission among those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means that a person has enough medications to prevent HIV infection from settling into his body.
Such drugs can be taken here two hours before a day or two before sex.
Those who are suitable for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transgender people and HIV-positive partners who have successfully treated them.
Clinical staff will select suitable participants from men, women, transgender individuals and unknown individuals whose partner's HIV status is controlled by an antiretroviral therapy.
Individuals living in the UK who are registered as practicing hecklers will be able to register for potential participation in participating local sexual health clinics.
The programme will cost £10 million and the NHS England has signed a deal this week to provide medicines to a nationwide offer.
Dentreme, the clinical evidence on how PrEP is targeted, implemented and applied on a large scale, is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP.
Bay Stevens said: 'This new and serious intervention will contribute to a broad and far-reaching and highly successful HIV prevention campaign.
This marks another milestone in the progress of thirty years in tackling one of mankind's most important health problems.'
Deborah Gold, president of the National Aids Trust (NAT), said: 'Bu, this is a milestone in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is targeted at those in need and those at risk, it has the potential to transform the HIV epidemic in the UK.
Since Eylülden, people with high HIV risk, through this experiment funded by the NHS in the UK, will really reach a new and powerful, privately controlled and open-minded market; this will lead to many lives being improved.
But we warmly welcome this proclamation.'
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'At the moment, the experiment must be rapidly rolled out nationwide and anyone at risk of HIV should not be left behind.
With the PrEP vaccine now available, we are heading for the coronary pathway to more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV".
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Public Health Minister, said: 'We welcome the start of the PrEP experiment and the months of hardship and subsequent government shutdown.
The study of this drug shows how transformative it can be in the fight against HIV, as part of our vision of combating HIV and in the detection of this life-changing infection.
Deney, without fully understanding the benefits of PrEP'in, will take us one step closer.
Now it is important that this experiment be rolled out nationwide as soon as possible to infect people living with HIV and bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.

Two secrets of death
Ayhan Çilingiroğlu, former Minister of Sanayi and Ticaret, died after his daughter Ümit Makbule Çilingiroğlu (51) fell from a 19'uncu floor in a business center used as a hotel in Istanbul Levent'te.
Melis Salihoğlu, a 24-year-old student at Koç University, was also found dead at the scene.
Salitrhoğlu was allegedly hanged.
An investigation into two secret deaths, which were later ruled suicide by police, has been launched.
'Depressed Hali Vardi' is the name of the film.
The daughter of Turkey's first Sanayi and Ticaret Minister Ayhan Çilingiroğlu, who served in the Nihat Ertrim government in 1971, and was born in 1966 in Washington, D.C., Ümit Makbule Çilingiroğlu, made her way into the Le Meridien Hotel in Etiler at 5pm on 1 August.
The Kuveytli Bir Tourist Hotel Management was notified by the Odtraya, a city in the Kataki region, that had been receiving reports of the death of its resident, and that an ambulance and police were called instead.
Poor health, 19'untr kattan sert zemine fell Çilingiroğlu'nun has claimed the life.
Anne Mediha Çilingiroğlu, a police spokeswoman, said: "There has been a lot of depression lately".
31 July, Ankara and Istanbul arrived.
My other daughter has leukemia hastası bir torunum.
"Bu torunumla was interested and was adversely affected by his disease", he said.
Cenazesi Adli Tıptr Kurumu' was lifted and Çilingiroğlu'nun Ankara was expected to be defended.
It is being investigated whether Çilingiroğlu was beaten or committed suicide.
'CANTRINA KIYDI' is the name of the idiom.
Another suspicious death in Istanbul was Sarıyer Zektryaköy'de.
Melis Salihoğlu (24) was found dead at Koç University.
According to reports, the girl's father, who has no contact with the news and cannot reach her daughter's eye, has gone missing near the scene.
Dad, at home he met the uncanny corpse of his daughter.
The very beloved Melis'in was pronounced asarak hayatına son verdiği by the radio, close circle and friends.
Melis Salihoğlu'nuntr death his family and relatives were forced to leave.
Melis was followed by a friend on social media, "Pırıl pırıl bir gün yüzümüze at the top of the hill".
Under our feet were green cotton, and Jack and his sister Eyşan were in the corner with a little plastic topping behind them.
"I needed to die now", he shared.
Luxury life: Asma kat and smart design numbers have turned this little Earls Courts apartment into a spacious one.
Former banker Joanne Leigh, who was passionate about the business, went to the Knightsbridge to shrink in 2014 by moving into a large apartment at Earls Court in Knightsbridge.
The Queen Anne style is a testament to the new design that Joanne was able to create at her first appearance and before collecting her vaults.
"Before, my ex-girlfriend, Knightsbridge, I used to live in a much larger area", Joanne recalls.
"I was looking for something that would be worth my price.
Earl Court's apartment was shown flat and had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and one day I made her an offer".
After the first meeting, we rented a 1000 ft. flat from the top down.
Originally a single-room and complexly planned property; you had to go through the kitchen to reach the bedroom.Joanne cömert wanted to add a storage area and a bathroom to make the most of the ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows and a lot of light.
This is my condition". he says.
This is to make use of the 12,5 ft' tower of the Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed'den Erfan Azadi'i to create not only a building but also a place for Joanne to live.
The tavan, in turn, was not high enough to add these two areas, so the architectural challenge was to create an asthma kit that could stand upright.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
"The small skeleton is quite carmic", he explains.
"We had to adjust the boxes so that they could collapse without having to bend down on each other.
It was not only a simple platform to build, but also steels that were so sloping that they would be at the right altitude according to the upper or lower function".
This arrangement, with many dramas and performances, allowed Erfan to get two full-length orders on top of each other.
Retrouvius's old tip for asthma cat is a copper light pencere, which looks down at the wonderful living area below.
The gold-coloured mirrored furniture, silver-colored furniture and old-fashioned Serge Mouille lighting design style determine the overall design.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the mechanism, the field and the light.
The short corridor with the two sides of the mirror makes it look longer.
The panel of the camera is giving another sensation of the opening of the cell.
The entrance to the new unit provides Joanne's all-black knife team and the züccaciyesine switching area.
The more spectacular is the beauty of the children's living room, the kitchen is unstable when not in use.
Opening up the mudflats is not new.
The unique feature of this is the garage-style lifting door.
Erfan, a steel-reinforced MDF gate with a steel-reinforced cylinder, explains, "We used some engineering.
"The weight of the denge is very high so when you push the door up it really slips easily".
With the clever use of the area and storage area, Joanne also gained 16 square meters, an extra one-bedroom and improved one-bedroom plan.
"At the end of the day, it's what you sell the property to, or the value of the property is determined", Erfan says.
"As a hypothetical, a realtor will enter and perform a calculation on the basis of the settlement area".
Here, while increasing the floor area, they managed to use quality materials that gave the area a luxurious appearance.
Erfan says, "Malzemtreler is a touchstone and thus helps to build emotional connection at home".
"Well, you won't fall in love with the electrical wires in the garage.
These are important, but do not shake the strings of your heart".
This is a proof that, through a good design and improved meter, an apartment can be transformed from a standard thing to something quite spectacular.
In fact, like Joanne, you may choose not to separate.
Jeremain Lens is good service to Beşiktaş'ta.
At the end of the 1.5 month-long talks, Lens bonservice, originally thought to be a lease, was transferred to Beşiktaş.
After a week of intense discussions, the team from Lens and Siyah-beyazlı agreed to a bond for 5 million euros in bonuses.
The Dutch player, who was signed to a five-year contract, was reportedly paid 2.2 million euros a year.
Beşiktaş is expected to make no official statement on the transfer of Jertremain Lens.
Wedding photos of famous couples.
For about four years, the man who has been in a long-term relationship with actor and singer Emre Altuğ, Sortie'de world event entered.
The couple immortalized the wedding ceremony with a photograph taken of what they called "a special moment of our life".
The couple decided to separate after 7 years.
The brothers are fighting for a $500 million real estate empire.
Two brothers, founded by Italian families forty years later, are fighting for one of Victoria's great empires, worth more than $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and manager Colin De Lutis, lives three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has been charged by the High Court with a case involving how to distribute property, property and business assets to a Toorak estate.
Paul had wanted to quit the family business since 2014, but the dispute over the split was still hotly contested in the High Court.
Together with his sister Anna and brother Smith Sokağı, they own 38 properties with a combined value of more than half a billion dollars from a store they bought in 1973 in Collingwood.
There, the Westco Jeans family built a chain of 160 retail outlets.
In 1999 it was sold for $85 trillion.
This property was put into operation and De Lutis's portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento shopping areas, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments and suburban shopping centers.
Under a settlement with deceased fathers, Colin (described by Paul as "a powerful force and a dominant individual" in the De Luttris family) owns two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul owns one-third.
A court filing says that this means Colin has $316 million in assets and Paul has $176 million in assets.
For Paul, the sharing of property and cash is a contentious issue.
In 2015, the court sentenced the first sentence of the oath, which read: "The divisions proposed by Colin left him with property I had added as my heir and heir".
Last Friday, after several failed hearings, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.
Erkek brother also has a long-standing dispute over who will control the current business; Paul claims Colin left him out of the business.
Colin admitted that this was not true, but Paul accused some of the owners of incompetence in managing the property.
Colin, who initially gave his verdict in a sworn statement, says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"Italy's roots dictate to every child that it is a priority".
Hundreds of page-like affidavits, emails, and e-mail messages recorded by firms including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, along with senior legal advisors from both sides, such as Allan Myers, QC, and other lawyers, are increasing.
Bayan De Lutis and the late cousin Luigi had been owned by Italian immigrants who owned bakeries and cafeterias since the late 1950s and had bought beer in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
Colin'in, who opened the first ever pant shop in the country, had pledged to buy the Collingwood property.
Colin, "Later in my last years, Paul was a little boy (about 10) " there Westco'yu speaks Kurdish.
Anna De Lutis herself and Luigi, who died in 2012, said they were reluctant to leave their belongings to their sons in a friendly manner.
"Luigi Bana often told me that he never wanted brothers to go to court", he wrote.
The other two brothers Mark and Luke are no longer part of De Lutis's group of businessmen; Colin says Mark was paid $10 million when he quit, and Luke $26 million when he left.
Paul said that both Luke and Mark "disagreed on the terms of their financial separation".
According to the 2015 biography of television star Eddi McGuire, best friend, Colin tried to avoid being noticed despite being a former member of the board of directors of an AFL club.
Fairfax Media, Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers contacted on Friday.
Just because Colin was in court with a short message, he responded, "Please tell me something".
"It was very sad that my brother Paultrun chose not to sue me and to drag our family name to court", he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court appeal that he was trying to comply with his brother's demands.
"Our father, Paul and I did not want to get into the current dispute", he said, adding that he was "clean about the solution".
On Friday, it seems that hope is gone.
Colin wrote, "The matter will be settled by the courts in the near future".
Trump's new special election plans to curb the president's media diet.
The others of denedi ve failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do that.
If it does, it will be the first.
Politico, the new Beyaz Saray special styline, announced that it would restrict President Trump's flow of information (including news media reports), to its employer with a more rigorous tutma umudu.
Here is some brief information from Muhabir Josh Dawsey'den:
"When senior staff met on the first day of work, White House special counsel John F. Kelly highlighted a fundamental problem President Donald Trump was planning to solve regarding the White House: the president's ability to get bad information.
Kelly explained that information should flow through the staff, on paper or through briefings, because the president, when given better information, would be able to make better decisions.
Kelly's story sounds very meaningful, but others have been unsuccessful in denying Trump's popularity by denying the media's diet.
President Trump's television relationship with Beyaz Saray goes back years and now, this TV show is in good shape.
Former campaign adviser Sam Nuntrberg told Politico in February, "Aday Trump, sorry that the media is not being fairly involved, is convinced that showing fair ground in persuasive media organizations is a way to increase revenue".
Tara Paltr of Politico once wrote, "According to six campaign officials, the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control was to ensure that personal media consumers contained a steady stream of praise".
All right, then.
But Trump's notion that his Twitter habits are "under control" at any given time is ridiculous.
Perhaps the campaign officials know something that our elders don't know, such as Trump's tweets, that would be much more provocative if they weren't intervening.
We'll probably never know about any tweets Trump hasn't sent.
If the elements managed to pull him out of the danger several times, then his efforts were worth it.
But no one has ever stopped Trump from continuing to create controversy.
Part of the problem was that Beyaz Saray was made up of competing hippie, in this case, people who tried to advance their own agenda with materials that Trump had given them (which could be reliable or unreliable) and who were promoting their own worldviews.
In May, Politico reported that, throughout the course of the campaign, the advisers had reported strategically uncertain information and trends.
An example, narrated in detail by reporter Shane Goldmacher, was as follows:
"Mevtrut and former Trump officials say Trump has reacted harshly to negative coverage, especially bad-impact leaks, from the Trump administration and has been obsessed with finding out where they came from.
This was the case in late February with the head of the bureau, Charles C. Johnson's Internet provocateur, from GotNews.com, a copy of a magazine that accused special assistant Katie Walsh'u Beyaz Saray of being "the source behind a series of leaks".
It didn't matter that Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, that there was no evidence, or that he had made and turned away from the wrong allegations in the past.
Trump has begun to write a sorcery about Walsh's staff".
Goldmacher, then special agent Reince Priebus and Beyaz Saray's staff secretary Rob Porter, said that "Trump's receipts are being managed and a system is being established".
But how did the result turn out?
Kelly tries to do the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will emerge as a more effective executive than Priebus, but Trump is still competing for influence on his own initiative and on the part of his aides.
This change will make Kelly's job quite difficult.
Crypto FETÖ"cüleri has revealed a special template.
The İzmir Cumhuriyet Advisor Berkant Karakaya, in the context of an investigation into the leak of some information and the use of the "army case investigation" tool, completed the investigation initiated by the head of staff of the Deniz Kuvvetleri Komutany General General General General General General General Cihat Yaycı on the allegation that a secret witness, code-named "Sarmaşık", was a FETÖ'cü".
In the letter, it was emphasized that General Tümtramiral Yaycı helped the investigation to decipher the cryptographic information of the non-governmental members of the Deniz Kuvvetleri Kommunity and played an active role in fighting FETÖ.
The note, which marked that Yaycı's coup attempt on July 15 was being pacified by the so-called "hard-line" order of the Deniz Kuvvetleri Komutany in order to verify the verdict, indicated that Yaycı had been actively fighting FETÖ since the first day of the coup attempt.
The decision to withdraw from Karaktraya's surveillance was made in the following manner: "It is understood that Yaycı's work with the detection of personnel of the Deniz Kuvvetleri Komutanlığı crypto community is based on a special template and 64 basic criteria for the detection of mensup FETÖ üyelerinin for the class of crypto mahrem service providers and a special system created on the basis of 209 alt criteria".
In the course of the legal investigation, a private and obstinate gay group was observed, and there was no evidence of any secret witness being attacked, except for the above-mentioned statement, but the general jury decided that it was impossible to assess the publisher, who is known to be an active anti-terrorist organization and who has made significant contributions to this method.
Admiral Yaycı had previously been tried on charges of hacking.
Behind this, it was revealed that FETÖ'cu were once again present and that the alleged crime was compassed.
The former Air Force Pilot Kurmay Albay Hakan Dinç, who had a complaint that Yaycı had mocked him, had only translated the complaint in the form of information notes into Belgian by the former Adana İncirlik 10.
Tanker Üs Commander Air Pilot Tuğgeneral Bekir Ercan Van, former Chief of Staff Adli Müşaviri Albay Muharrem Köse, former Chief of Staff İstihbarat Korgeneral Mustafa Özsoy, former Hâkim Binbaşı Erkan Ağın, former Deniz Yüzbaşı Necmettin Aksoy, former Hâkim Yüzbaşı Akif Us and former Hâkim Üsteğmen Serdar Çamiçi ile Yaycı'nin's former witness, former Hâkim Albay Mustafa Çekran, who issued the summons, were deported due to ties with the FETÖdan.
Some of the members of the organization, including FETÖ fighter Tuncay Opçin, revealed that they targeted Yaycı by posting on social media before and after the July 15 coup attempt.
Gezginler was a woman, and the 'zengin mahallesine' returned.
Some of the wealthy landowners in the West Midlands fought back with the desperate travellers who had been cut down by the council to reclaim the land outside their own.
Gezginler parked his 20 caravans outside an area known as the 'zenginler neighborhood', which is Solihull's still-occupied street.
The council, having been at the mouth of the creek for several years to cut its streams, returned with a baby and a truckload of goods just after the closure in May.
Zekice, a moving group of defense workers, found a gap in the defense, and forced their vehicles into the area by making a roadway through a barricade.
An angry resident sharply criticized Solihull Council, saying that it was "useless in solving the problem".
A resident said: "The stone throwers who crossed the river arrived there on Monday evening after being sent from Bentley Heath.
The Congress should be ashamed of its movements because they are useless in solving problems.
Gezginler had spoken in May, had been sent, and now they have returned again.
There was more coming last night, probably more coming today".
Ekledi: 'Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this with its long-term removal decisions to protect parks.
Ben, I live on Streetsbrook Street and I'm not happy to continue paying taxes, which the council can't even stop.'
One local sakini who wanted to give a statement said: 'As usual, we saw that the last group of travelers had just left and were immediately destroyed by a new group.
The animals had been raised this time and were seen eating in the park area.'
A female Solihull Council spokeswoman said: 'We are aware that there is an unauthorised camp on the grounds of Streetsbrook Street, so we are launching the necessary legal proceedings to send them there as soon as possible.
To support our campaign, it is essential that as many of the 101 areas as possible report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police.
This will help to bring our case to court and help to establish the status of the court's official decree.'
Galatasaray, Ndiaye'yi borsaya has reported.
Galatasaray Sportif Sınai and Ticari Yatırımlar AŞ'den Borsa İstanbul sent a statement on the Kamuyu Aydınlatma Platform that said the club, Osmanlıspor's football team and the club will be paid a bonus of 7 million 500 bin euros, leagues, cupades and a total of 25 matches in Europe will be played at 750 bin, 50 more matches will be played at 750 bin.

In addition, in matches played in the TFF Süper Lig and UEFA competitions, the yellow-red team will receive 5 bin avro prime verilecek for each point.
In a statement, it was announced that the player had been awarded the contract for a one-sided termination fee of 18 million euros, effective 15 June 2019.
Sontr Gün telaşı is the day!
They were looking at İtfaiye stations.
The storm and hail that hit Istanbul last Thursday caused thousands of vehicles to be damaged.
While most of the drivers who reported the losses to insurance companies made their claims, the report has so far been in the pipeline for the driver to report.
Today, drivers who are not notified have been called to the fire stations to report the incident, as it was the last day of the alert.
Today is the last day of our lives.
The driver first took photos of the vehicles to the fire department to detect the damage to their vehicles.
The driver who was diagnosed with the damage to his vehicle later reported it to the officials.
Hasan Erol, who came to the fire station for a report, said, "I've made a photo shoot".
When I stopped Bentr there was a lot of pressure.
"There was a camda hasar", he said.
The driver Erbil Kılıç, "It is a costly decision".
It is a secret money.
We took the picture.
"We will now wait for the report", he said.
The Deniz ile karaya duvar, which is a skywalker, does not care about breathing.
CHP'li Meclis Ütryesi Nadir Ataman, in a warning of earthquakes regarding the sahilde rising dev yapis, said: "Davadaki bilirkişi report says net that these structures will not withstand depression at 6 degrees".
The fact that the stumps of solid material are 25-30 meters high indicates that they have not been dug into the skin.
Istanbul Ataköy is a two-story high-rise hotel and residential building located between the sea and the sea.
CHP'li Bakırköy Belediyesi Meclis Üyesi Nadir Ataman, the chairman of the dev AVM, hotel and residences project group, said that the decision was made to increase the number of employees.
Noting the wind-shedding of the buildings in the Sahildeki, Ataman said, "From 80 years ago, the wind-planners who designed the Florya'ya Atatürk Forest formed the Atatürk Forest.
Eighty years later, the concept of how urbanism was achieved was reached by the wind tunnels being transformed into a climate change.
"The breathing is not taken", he said.
Noting that climatic changes in the climate of climates such as the Ataköy sahiltrinde walls, Ataman continued: "The temperature is felt 10 degrees higher due to the gökdelenler".
These buildings must be built in the direction of the winds.
Or our skyrocket Istanbul is rising above the windy corridors.
The wind is blowing through the inside of the engine.
These structures are the natural means of life.
Noting the connection and the lack of connection between these smoking, environmental and human health-damaging debris and the sea for the Bakırköy people, Anıtlar Kurulu'na said they would appeal the matter to the court.
In the meantime, surgery-free treatment is possible.
In the cases of phentrol administration, 83 percent of cases are successful.
In this way, the diseased tissue is effectively cleaned and the tissue gap is filled with a deadly agent that kills the roots.
The laser method is another of the treatment techniques for unmedicated hair removal.
With various lasers, the fibers of the root and surrounding tissue are burned by the radiation emitted by the ring, which ensures that the tissue is glued to the wall during this process.
These two non-operative methods of the disease allow patients to return to their social and work lives more quickly.
Dr Mert Atak, who noted that overweight, lifestyle inactivity, prolonged sitting, heavy hair and body hair, and lack of hygiene and compliance with the rules of the diet, said that symptoms of the disease include low back pain, infection, apse and diarrhea.
Italy is harnessing STK's approach to migrant rescue boats.
Italy, the STKs operated by Akdeniz'de migrant rescue boat, warned that they would not be allowed to continue if they complied with the new rules affecting their operations.
Interior Minister Marco Minniti, in an interview with the Torino newspaper La Stampa'ya, said, "If STK's comply with the new regulations, it will be difficult to see them continue to operate".
Minniti's warning came a day after the arrest of a technician, an Italian authoritarian, employed by German aid agency Jugend Rettet, who was suspected of cooperating actively with human traffickers to facilitate illegal immigration.
A relief effort that has been active for only a year, the Italian cleric Ambrogio Cartosio has refused to comment on the contents of the detailed detainees' arrests.
The social media group said in a statement: "Saving human lives is, and will be, a top priority for us, so we are very sorry that we are not currently able to work in the search and rescue area".
"We can only assess the allegations made at this time after collecting all the information and evaluating the situation".
Italian officials have been following Jugend Rettet'in teknesi Iuventa'yı since the beginning of the month.
Mürettebatın, who is suspected of taking migrant technicians from the rubber bottles delivered directly to them by human traffickers, and allowing them to reuse the technicians.
According to the files of the scientist published by the Italian media, at least one such meeting, allegedly occurred 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya, took place.
Mürettebat, who for one reason or another oversaw the rescue operations in the region due to a lot of human effort, is under no authority from the Italian coastal security.
According to the custom, the technicians like Iuventa were supposed to be led by an Italian police officer who would oversee their activities.
Of the nine STKs involved in rescue and rescue operations, only three have so far agreed to comply with the terms of reference: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latest of these, on Tuesday, he said he considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they would not cause any "serious change or inconvenience" to his own rescue operations.
Among the signatories who have given their consent is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Sınır Tanımayan Doktorlar (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue last weeks was a sign of the fruit of efforts to strengthen security along the Libyan coast and cooperation with local governments.
Bakantr said: "We have recently started to see the light in the tunnel sound".
This month, he held further talks with Libyan officials about economic development initiatives and announced plans to reduce the number of migrants leaving Chad, Niger and Mali to reach Europe as soon as they reach these countries.
Sontr minute yumruq!
At the "paraşütçü day" celebrations in Moscow, the Russian capital, carpush yen vodka was drunk, as every year.
Nikita Razvozjayev, a Russian NTV television correspondent who was involved in the activity and who was a heavy drinker, attacked while broadcasting live at the Russian Gorki Park.
On Canlı, the actor, a reporter, once a man was standing and shouting "We will seize Ukraine".
Sarhoş adam, who was identified as an old parachute, served him a yumruk attı on the warning of the woman.
Aldığı yumruk darbesiyle afallayan muhabir, adamdan tried to get away from him.
Millions of people watched the show live.
The Economic Coordination Committee met today.
The Economic Coordination Council (EKK), headed by Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek, was convened under the economic leadership.
The first ever EKK meeting under the leadership of Şimşek, after the change of cabinet, began at 6:30 pm in Çankaya Köşkünde.
Turkey's macroeconomic outlook is in full swing.
The meeting, chaired by Shimshek, was attended by Mali's Minister of Finance Naci Ağbal, Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü, Minister of Labour and Social Security Jülide Sarıeroğlu, Minister of State for Trade and Industry Bülent Tüfenkci, Minister of State for Kalkınma Lütfi Elvan, Hazine Müsteşarı Osman Çelik, Central Bank President Murat Çetinkaya and other relevant bureaucrats.
It is possible to get rid of the Beltrot oil in 45 minutes.
Doç noted that only 5 percent of patients treated with belfry need surgery.Dr. Oğuz Karaeminoğlu, "According to the results of the hospital's examination and imaging, the first step is rest and medication treatment", says.
Specifically, he pointed out that the initial methods (such as epidural injections, radio frequency techniques, disc-based techniques) should be tried in the patient's pain-related area, warning that "if any of these methods are successful, and the pain and weakness in the back are detected, then surgery is necessary".
Noting that the risk or even the risk of 'full-close belfry surgery' being performed today, which has not been successfully performed, has led to a reduction in the amount of cellulite in patients who have undergone surgery, Karatremino sons point out that it is possible to get rid of belfry in 45 minutes:
Microscopic surgery or open surgery has very good results, but there may be some complications, such as a long recovery period after surgery, spinal patches, recurrence of spinal cord injury, and further development of belts and infections.
Most often microscopic certrhi is defined as 'closed surgery', but microscopic certrhi is used in the same way as open certrhi.
In the case of a complete cirrhosis of the spine, this risk is eliminated as the surrounding tissue is inflamed.
The full-blown belt surgery only takes 45 minutes.
The Special Commissioner is in charge of the work.
The commission is chaired by CHP MPs Mehmet Gökdağ, Cemal Okan Yüksel, Barış Yarkadaş and Yüksek Disiplin Kurulu Üyesi Turan Aydoğan.
Commission, Berberoğlu'nuntr 4 Ekim'de İstanbul 14.
The Ağır Ceza Mahkemesi'ndeki trial will be followed by the applications made by the Anayasa Mahkemesi and Bölge İstinaf Mahkemesi.
In the letter of appointment, signed by CHP General Secretary Kamil Okyay Sındır and Vice-President Bülent Tezcan, "The independence and impartiality of the Yargı is an indispensable condition of the administration of any emir almamas except the law".
"Our deputy, Enis Berberoğlu, in the course of his duties as deputy, did not request any special status, did not take refuge in the parliamentary armor of the parliament, did not seek to protect the judge's belief in his independence and impartiality".
In the judicial process, it was argued that the judge preferred to apply political emirs rather than judicial rulings.
In Yazida, it was argued that the fact that the Anayasa Mahkemesi's arrests of MPs were made without a verdict despite the wrong decisions of the court was a clear indication that the court had taken a decision under the influence of the court.
Michelle Carter was jailed for messages encouraging the suicide of Conrad Roy.
A woman in Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide via text messages and phone conversations.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years on a drug-related parole.
Carter was convicted of the murder of Conrad Roy's taxi driver on his own account on 13 July 2014.
Bay Roy's father, who spoke at the trial on Wednesday, said: "My heart is broken.
My son was my best friend".
Carter's release was granted before the appeal process was open.
Azami faced a 20-year-old jail cell in a pair of pants that his law firm and his Bay Roy's team claimed were suffering from mental illness.
Carter was wearing red pants and cream-colored blues, with his eyes covered in old cheese, his elbows covered, and his eyes burning to the ground.
Savcı told the court, "Ontrun's agent killed Conrad Roy".
He sacrificed his life to improve his condition.
He did not accept the sorrow".
"He never showed any remorse".
But Carter's lawyer said, "It was a terrible situation that she regretted deeply".
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not see "youth, maturity, or even mental illness having any significant effect on the behavior".
A lawyer at Bay Roy's sister Lynn Roy quoted her as saying: "I will not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of how he and I have handled this situation, and I try to be with his sisters as soon as we can".
Bay Roy's sister Camdyn Roy said that she was "unconscious" of the fact that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be able to have her children.
"The fact that I have been with you every day since I was born is a pain that will always be with me for the rest of my life", she said.
Since there is no Massachusetts law that criminalizes telling someone to commit suicide, it seems likely that a lawsuit will arise.
Carter was 17 when Bay Roy was found dead in 2014 of carbon monoxide poisoning in a car.
Dava was intrigued when Carter's short messages revealed that they encouraged her to end her own life.
While she was in a car accident, she wrote in a series of messages two weeks before her death: "I'm like, a building, a building, a knife, I don't know, a lot of roads".
In the days before his death, he had written: "You must do this, Conrad" and "If you open the generator you need, you will be free and happy".
Judge Moniz, giving instructions not to allow him to bring the suit through the courtroom, said Carter wanted to draw attention to Bay Roy's death.
Dava has made legal connections.
Among Carter's soap actors was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
After Knox (30), a Los Angeles Times interviewer published a piece saying: "Michelle Carter is a misunderstanding and a helper, not a prisoner".
Mehmet Şimşek'ten has a remarkable growth forecast.
In his statement, Şimşek pointed out that Turkey's low inflation should be reduced to a certain amount and said that food inflation constitutes a "risk zone".
The Deputy Prime Minister predicts inflation will fall below 7 percent in 2018.
In his speech Şimşek said:
The next 12 months are critical in the rise of uncertainty.
The biggest incentive is to reduce uncertainties.
There is a strong government.
Political uncertainty is not.
I hope that the uncertainties in our geography will be clear.
By increasing our resilience to some reform shock, I believe Turkey is experiencing a growth trend of over 5 percent.
Ben, I told you a few months ago.
The entrance is closed so that the traffic can be stopped.
Slowly, we no longer focus our energy on areas, but on energy for inclusive growth, employment growth, and reforms.
Therefore, the next 12 are critical.
On the one hand, reform, on the other, uncertainty, and on the other, there is no political uncertainty.
Hopefully, we will have a chance to see the problems in our geography nearby.
We are in a state of collapse in the market for many of our classics.
Like Libya, Iraq, and more.
Not only do we lose Pazar, we face a wave of migration of over 3.5 million.
Over the past 15 years, Turkey has grown by 5.7 percent despite all these shocks.
Turkey, that is, we are beginning to have solid problems.
Now we are pushing Turkey back to a growth policy of over 5 percent by increasing our leverage against some reformla shocks and further easing the question mark on investors' heads.
Let me be clear, from here, we have such a cömert retirement system.
I think it would be reasonable if I told you that our employer has not done enough.
Once in a car, the performance will be strong.
What is it?
Because we are very careful.
Firms don't have to go out and make the effort and pay the expenses.
We have observed these concerns, dictated poor performance, and debated how to allocate global assets to which investment areas.
Mevduatta, you know, get the higher the getter.
Once the net state income is 25 percent, there will be a performance there.
The ILAVETEN are backed by the risk paper, where the risk is generally low.
As we look at the big picture, I think interest will increase in the coming period.
Because they'll see the performance.
In other areas, it is not a failure, but a success.
We reconstructed the BEStr in 2013.
There are 6.8 million participants, 70 billion liras.
The system has been successful.
Automatic participation was attended by 2.6 million participants, 775 million liras and briquettes.
We want companies to put in a little more effort.
Let them do some advertising, let them tell the system.
We are working on Caytrama.
Maybe he's a little bit of a snitch...
We're going to do it, we're working.
Perhaps citizens will see the results and see the combination and stay in the system.
The system's exit rate is 38.3 percent.
Almost half of those divorced were voluntary individuals.
You don't want two individual e-mail accounts.
Are you not doing this?
You're getting out of the car.
We were actually expecting a beer in the neighborhood of 10 percent.
There, that means we're very busy.
The Birtr kere system is working.
We brought a prime roof.
The insurance companies are one-sided.
They raised their primates very quickly.
As a result, the court decisions said that the existing regulations were not being dictated.
We've made a new net adjustment.
We called it Siz de gereği yapıntr.
They said yes, we will wait for the trial.
We've said that this is not the case.
We had our differences of opinion in the past.
Or, as the practice of ceiling prim went on, some firms declined.
We've made a new arrangement.
Riskli insurance companies have created a lot of risk.
Shunu tellyeyim, let me go again.
I prefer that this system works through Bentr rekabet.
So I don't see these ceiling price practices as being right, they've just let us live.
I'll be there for three more days and see what happens.
Let the system we have created be dictated.
Two, the normal system of operation, or the price of a stock.
The burden of the debt is heavy, and the premium of her 100 liras is almost 30-31 lirası tax going to the SGK quarters.
I'm working right now, so we'll talk to our manager.
Third, technology is moving faster.
Now, traffic accidents will be reduced dramatically in structure.
Or is it a serious traffic insurance policy?
SABAH has saved the manhattan bay.
Buerger's disease, which has been present since adolescence, was a common disorder in male Eskimos, but has now become more common in women.
One of these women is 36-year-old Mehtap Dursuntr.
The pain that began two years ago was chronicled in the foot.
A young woman forced to leave Yürümekte faced the risk of losing her leg.
A friend of his, Prof. Dr. Yusuf Kalko'yu, suggested it.
SABAH showed the news on the manşet 'Azerbaijan Olağanüstü Haller Bakanı saved the life of the Minister.'
It was then revealed that he was battling Dursun'un Buerger's disease, which was on his way to Kalko'ya.
Prof. Dr. Kalko, the young woman underwent acil surgical treatment.
Dursun, who recovered from his pain shortly afterwards, is now undergoing oxygen therapy.
The car is equipped with a Ters Tepkiyle Karşı Karşıyayken Audi 850,000 Diesel Aracı Modifiye Edecek.
A day before the announcement, Audi announced that BMW would be upgrading its software to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of the board of directors of BMW, BMW's headquarters (which is considered to be the place where diesel vehicles are banned or restricted), Munich, including European cities, said that the company believes that "there are more smart options than traffic restrictions".
Daimler said on Tuesday it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the firms identified these companies as recruitment.
European automakers have been heavily promoting the use of diesel vehicles to help meet carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States.
But the nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines adds to the cancer-causing effects and can cause asthma.
The cost of the equipment that automotive companies need to cut down on diesel exhaust emissions is rising and making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German automakers faced a series of scandals, and Chancellor Angela Merkel's government was accused of ignoring the wives and daughters of powerful automakers.
Companies that hide that they are using a device known as a decoy and that when a car is tested, adjust emissions to meet regulations and avoid repeating Volkswagen's mistakes that have been made under normal driving conditions.
Many Volkswagen executives have been charged by the US and others by the Atlantic are under investigation.
Last month, in Audi's engine development department, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, was an Italian and therefore convicted of crimes against humanity and could be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year Audi was drawn into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen; the authorities had expanded the United States-based investigation after accusing Audi of using a system to circumvent emissions rules in Europe.
Audi's involvement in the investigation may be a heavy one for Volkswagen: Luxury car manufacturer, Volkswagen's profits are over-priced.
Hertr sees the balıklama atlama as it is.
The chairman of Türk Nöroşirürji Derneği, Prof. Dr. Yusuf Şükrü Çağlar, warned of a deeply uncertain, 2 meters shallow earth atlanma.
Every year thousands of people are at risk of falling from a slug due to broken neck and spinal cord injury.
Boyun fractures are often 5 or 6" in length.
The characteristic feature of fractures is that this level affects the nerve cells that supply the col and bacak muscles as well as the solunum muscles.
Prof. Dr. Çağtrlar, "In such accidents, the region of the spinal cord, our precious organ, is cut by the fractured spine or becomes dysfunctional due to compression".
"In Omurilik's cases, the wrong first aid is the only way to increase the damage caused by the accident and not to lead to death", he said.
Suya balıklama dalmak, fourth in line in the omurilik yaralanma.
The average age of the victims is 20-29 years and the majority are male.
Prof. Dr. Çağtrlar, "The resulting change should not be ignored".
"As long as the flow is good, a heavy wound can survive", he said.
Prof. Dr. Çağtrar also recalled:
Depending on the level of the omurelin in the area where the damage occurred, different degrees of felc may occur in the col and bacak.
You may know the truth, but it can be changeable.
The area that seems deep to you may be shallow.
Thanks to the warning signs installed on the coastlines of the USA and Australia, 70 percent of shallow water atlama cases were diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
Prof. Dr. Çağtrlar, "Turkey, despite having a denize shore for 28 years, unfortunately does not have a single warning sign outside Istanbul".
"Hayat Karartan needs to be carefully monitored in the summer before the health department, schools and social awareness project on the beaches and in the bays, with information lights or information boards".
TÜRK Nötrşirürji Derneği Spinal and Peripheral Sinir Cerrahisi Group Chairman Prof. Dr. Kadir Kotil, the child, suggested that the following be done:
112 should be arranged as the first job in Otrlay.
The boyun should be as fixed as possible, move as fast as possible, and serve as a detector.
The airway must be maintained and the water drained from the water should be kept on the right side.
The water should not be drained from the seeds and drained to drain the water.
No attempt should be made to correct the shape-shifting wrinkles on the neck of the Hastan.
Boutron's back may have been broken.
However, if the spine has not yet been damaged, during first aid and patient transportation the boyna will be placed in an inappropriate position, the broken chemical parts may cause the spine to be pressed and the spine to be damaged.
Provence lavantası under threat from climate change
Provence in southern France has become a symbol of the city, but there is a warning that it is under threat from climate change.
Lavanta, a drought-induced disease, is falling due to disease-carrying insects, causing a headache for scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because in recent years there has been much less and mostly sunny vegetation, especially in the rain, which has been affected by climate change and other factors.
This affects the lifespan of the lavender.
There are also a number of micro-bacterial actors, including a small, poisonous species of ostrich insect, and many of them are grown in the air".
And many things are necessary.
The amount of lavender oil used for perfumes and cosmetics is dropping steadily.
Eric Chaisse said: "While the widest flower should have very long plant buds, we have smaller, less developed or no or weaker buds.
So we have fewer essential oils".
Among the solutions tested, it includes better water distribution and slower ground evaporation, but with more water-resistant and more environmentally friendly mixtures, it is possible to develop a more resistant turler.
The Chinese newspaper Gazeteci paints the largest gold tehdidin in Mexico.
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodotrce in Sinaloa often scramble on Wednesdays to review plans for newspaper coverage of organized crime, corrupt memories and the endless drug wars.
But on this day, they met to discuss their safety in the shadow of their own tragedy.
They were told that it was important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what makes them feel safer: bringing their children with them to the office where the 2009 bombing was targeted, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the hall: hasımlar, bezrafsızlar, müttefikler.
They ask reporters to suggest names for their column; no letters are needed, only letters and insider notes are sufficient.
Journalists suspected of bribing drug traffickers, politicians, business people, government or cartel workers, and a list of bad guys who have made the chaos of Mexico's newspaper industry dangerous.
More and more journalists are becoming journalists: According to the Committee on the Judiciary, at least 25 people have died since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people have died under federal law since the attacks and threats.
Among the sons of the authors were managers of writing and inspiration sources, as well as Riodoce's co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas da Var.
"It's a big mistake to live in Mexico and be a journalist", Valtrdez writes in the cover of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is felt deeply, but his presence is everywhere, with a large photograph showing Valdez's middle finger on the front of Riodoce's building with the word "Adalet" on it; two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing t-shirts showing his smile, eye-catching face and the flamboyant Panama hat.
The work, which takes place less than two months after his death, tells of his fellow traumatized, hostile, sleepy, paranoid experiences.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was created in 2010 to prosecute journalists, according to the Gazetecileri Koruma Committee, only two were prosecuted.
Every year, like thousands of other Chinese companies linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, the killers of journalists are sometimes brought to justice.
Riodoce'de; despite their broken hearts, the earth is now more transformative, they insist on touching the silt in Sinaloa.
Without knowledge of the killer, without the idiot, without the security consultation, it's hardly working, Ibarra says.
"This is a stupid job and a stupid job", he says.
"Unless we know why, you trust no one".
On the morning of May 15, Valtrdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the state capital.
The red Toyota Corolla was only able to drive a few blocks before being stopped by two men; it was forced out of the vehicle and hit 12 times, about to be named after the newspaper, translated as Onikinci Nehir.
The gunman drove off in his carriage and hit the vehicle nearby.
Valtrdez was 50 years old.
He was survived by his wife and two adult children.
Culiacan'da dedicated freedom does not do this.
But there is nothing here but silent talk about Valtrdez.
Sinaloa has become one of the country's most active battlefields, as the U.S. has been fighting to fill the gap in the military forces since Guzman's arrest last year and the U.S. has been fighting to fill the gaps since then.
Let Sinaloa's sock be a waste of killing one or more people every day or letting the cemetery be filled with many more exquisite, two-story, large mosques that the drug kings used to live in.
For a minute, just forget your "sükunet" status to control the high-value ports of the cartel and the US drug trafficking routes.
Despite this and despite the depth of Valdez's awareness of the dangers of the business, Riodoce's former partner and manager Ismail Bojorquez (60), was found guilty of failing to keep his friend accountable.
He believes that the two mistakes contributed to the signature.
First, a February broadcast featured an interview with Damaso Lopez, leader of one of the rival cartel groups fighting Guzman's sons.
This may have infuriated the sons of the paper; the suspected gang members bought every copy of the printed edition to be distributed to the newspaper bays.
A second mistake, after another newspaper with the same story told Valtrie, was to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as a decisive moment for Mexican men who were opposed to newspapers.
He had survived for so long, that his friends and colleagues pretended that he would always be there.
A veteran reporter from the Northwest in 2013 was involved in the $50 joint venture that involved five of his business associates in the discovery of Riodoce.
"It was impossible to make a newspaper without touching the drug issue", said Bojorquez.
It soon gained a reputation for its newspaper, newsstand, and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters, without fear of censorship, were devoted to publishing investigative reports and were immersed in a publication of stories that no one dared to tell.
Riodoce, eight years after its founding, won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for its news in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez, Mexico's drug lord, won the International Committee of the Red Cross's Gazetecileri Koruma Award for his portrayal of the endlessness of the drug story.
He openly admitted to being a fool.
During the CPJ awards ceremony, he said, "I want to continue my life".
In an interview with Rompeviento TV, Sinaloa denied drug trafficking was "a way of life".
"You have to accept the job you deserve as a journalist, you're either stupid or stupid.
I don't want to be upset by the child saying, 'What were you doing in the face of so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what happened?'"
The staff of Riodoce misses Valtrdez; the blasphemous joker like Hamal, his friends who were generous in their gossip and advice, his teachers who knew how to survive...
Her routine is more reliable.
Hertr then wore his hat.
The bar called Eltr Guayabo across the street from the office was a bar and the same table was always available.
Now they ask: Has his love for routine collapsed?
His death, and the way they could do their jobs and survive, forced them to question their own assumptions.
"If you're dealing with their women, children, clean jobs, secret airplane tracks they use to smuggle drugs, they don't like it".
"Things are about crossing the line", Bojorquez said.
As a result, the car was recently fitted with a high-grade auto-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting in your own instincts.
If there is a bad cochlear implant, stay away.
Andres Villarreal, director of creative writing at Riodoce, said: "This is a changeable feeling... and what happened to Javier happened".
O and others say that the old rules do not apply in Sintraloa; the same as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that host poor corporate and corrupt government officials, there are no illegal smuggling routes with a toxic mix of black and white.
The Earth's surface is constantly changing.
When Riodoce personnel gathered for security training, no cell phones were allowed; days ago, it was revealed that casus software sold only to governments was used to spy on journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers tried to escape a 104 degree (40 degrees Celsius) heat, under the shade of a tree.
Riodoce'nin, assigned by the state government to run Culiacan's four-story office building in a middle-class apartment building.
Seriously, some reporters wondered if these members were among the 50 percent of the police who Valinin himself said was not trustworthy.
Muhabirler, a drug cartel operative, controlled the mountainous countryside of the Gidheli Aylar.
This week's Lord of Riot has three children hikayeyi irdeliyor.
Former boxing champion Julio Cesar Chavez' brother had a signed contract in Sinaloa.
In addition, there was a revelation of government officials who were concentrated in the valley.
A group of people were abducted from Culiacan's expensive restaurant a block away from the village.
There was no official explanation as to whether or not Kim was kidnapped, so when it was time to write that everyone in the city knew about it, the issue was decided: The restaurant was run by drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter, from official records, learned that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Kurumsal Devrimci Parti (PRI), which had been its chief judge for almost the entire last century of politics.
Recently, many PRI suitcases have been accused of corruption in sensational incidents.
Villatrreal, the correspondent, or on the spot "El Chapo" asked Guzman to write about earlier events, including the escape of one of Guzman's sons from a soldier's hostage.
Only months ago, they would have gone to Valdez's corner for information provided by the best source on the kidnapping.
Due to the inclement weather, Villareal (46) "Eltr Flaco" said, "We already knew what was happening in Önceleri".
"All our communication channels with our resources are now blocked".
While the staff never gave anything away, to activists in the name of the pool, Valdez's office is being reused as a warehouse for banners and posters for journalists protesting the murders.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few posters and went out to the local sheriff's office to protest for another newspaper this morning.
Salvador Adame, a native of the western Michoacan province, disappeared three days after Valdez was killed.
A burnt-out ceset was found and DNA tests indicate that it was a o.
Gazettists across the country, organizing protests in the streets and the bins, wrote "Help the Bahai" and voiced their thoughts louder.
Today, director Bojorquez, a long way from Washington, is trying to provide international support for the adalet during Valdez's vacation.
At a meeting in the Sinaloa suitcase on the morning of Valtríndez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of making a case for newspapers and killing them for telling the truth.
A day later, he thought that the government was stifling his neutrality and asked for a job other than reporting.
Valtrdez repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "squeezed out" by organized crime, accomplices, officials and a grotesque society.
In his latest book, "Drug News", he wrote that journalists were killed not only by drug gangs, but also by politicians and security forces who cooperated with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19, linked more than half of the attacks on newspapers last year to police and officials.
Ramirez said, "You're going to die in Mexico because you're going to be stunned".
Cinayetler clearly had a cold shower effect.
No one can forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Cesedi was found with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "I am here because of my news".
A computer keyboard and headset, a serial next to a coffee shop.
The northern border state of Chihtruahua and Miroslava Breach'in, after the murder of their reporter in March, chose to shut down some publications, such as El Norte.
After the 2004 assassination of their managers, others continue to do as Nuevo Laredo and El Manana did.
In 2010, the headline on the front page of the Diario de Ciudad Juarez was: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their own states, and even their own countries.
This is a burkan decision.
They are searching the streets in the hope of finding work in the rush and even in danger.
Three months after escaping from Bazen de Veracruz in 2015, four women and a photographer, Ruben Espinoza, were allegedly murdered in an apartment in Mexico City.
For Gertride, who continues to work, it's a daily dance with these high-risk decisions.
Itrbarra, who once wanted to be a poet, says that reporting on the drug trade has scared him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist", he said.
On a past Saturday, around midnight, while the late master was preparing for the finish, the Riodoce editorial managers sat down on the sidewalk outside the office and drank a beer, and at the same time their phones started ringing.
A series of armed clashes, including gangs and security forces, near Mazatlan, a Sahil desert resort, have resulted in 19 confirmed deaths.
The war was still raging, as indicated in a series of cartel messages found around.
Kaldırımtrand through cell phones was informed of Riodoce's website koydular.
The previous page was to be changed the next day.
The siren began to sing nearby, and there was another gunfight around.
Bojorquez quickly looked at the police officers who were on duty to see if they were being targeted.
If they were afraid, they would even show off.
Under the huge portrait of the newspaper's yenik guards, his middle finger was pointed out to all Sinaloa, while the Riodoce's crew was following in his footsteps.
"How can you think of a deal", Bojorquez said, "on the day Javier was killed, asking me to send him out to do a street news interview with an intern?"
To avoid the enemies of the dinosaurs, he used camouflage.
The first sighting of a beehive was a benziyor but a terrible beehive.
The researchers explained that the first bulgars of an incredible creature of the size of a giant found by a Canadian miner were now very well decorated, which experts describe as the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
So well-colored that they could understand that the pul pul pul derisi was a red-brown color and could say that it had a'simple past'.
A report in the journal Current Biology described it as "the best-known yellow-crowned dinosaur and one of the best dinosaur species in the world".
Fossils, dating from the middle of the Cretaceous period, 110 million to 112 million years ago, are a newly discovered nodezor species.
This hidden state of life, described as "really miraculous", surprised researchers.
According to National Geographic, this is the most preserved fossil found in its own genus.
The Suncor Millennium Madeni near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta, Canada, was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011.
By looking at the rocks around him, he hit something that seemed strange and decided to look closer.
The fossil extracted from the Ortaya was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
The next six years were spent trying to uncover wildlife from a 2,500 pound-trillion (1100 kg) pile of soil.
After such a thorough study, the completed result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you close your eyes a little bit, you can almost believe we're sleeping", said Caleb Brown, head writer and scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, who exhibits the love of your life.
'Science will go through the history of the dinosaurs as a beautiful, coronated dinosaur species, the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
The researchers, looking into the skin, found that if the beetle was covered in a tank of gasoline, it would likely be facing a serious threat from dinosaurs.
The heavily armed dinosaurs used red and white camouflage to protect themselves from predators and used a shadow technique known as counter-shading, which is used by many modern animals.
Experts, claiming that it was devoured by larger dinosaurs, say that it allowed them to better interact with their environment and overcome their enemies.
The 110 million-year-old nodezortr family creature first appeared on the public display in May and is now a sergeant-general at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
The researchers have now completed their work and named the museum technician Mark Mitchell after wildlife species Borealopelta markmitchelli, who was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours diligently trying to uncover it.
The extraordinary corrosion of the strap made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to design and shape the straps and document the armor on the body.
The Haytrvanlar system is a common defense method in the Haytrvanlar world and is a counter-bullet explorer, meaning that the top of the creature is darker by alt.
Although contra-shrimping is common, it is a surprise to the locals because the Borealopelta's boycott is very much in line with the current live anti-shrimping animals.
This, the fact that it has been continuously undermined by bu, dinosaur, and other dinosaurs, means that it is possible to face the evrimination as a survival method.
However, modern animals (such as geykler, zebra or armadillo) using the contra-shadow are much smaller and more pronounced; this means that this nodezor faced serious difficulties in surviving.
Brown said, 'The devasa, heavily armored birder's practice of strong hunting shows just how dangerous the dinosaur predators on Crete can be.'
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the pulses also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including contents of its corrupted intestines, to find out what it ate at its last meal.
It is believed that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was dragged into the denise, where it was found to be the ocean surface.
Alberta, South Florida, at the time, was as hot as it is today, and probably more nehirler and ocean-going birds were spread out into the interior than they are now.
Brown said, "Nodozortr, completely covered with pulp deriyl and corned, but also really noteworthy for the animal's original 3-by-foot shape".
'So, the animal looks exactly the same as it did in Crete in the early days as it does here today.
You don't need much imagination to rebuild it; if you close your eyes a little, you can almost believe we're sleeping.'
The earthquakes of the Dev teropods, two dinosaurs that stood on Crete and were dinosaurs, were on the horizon.
Although he was the king of the Hewes, Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years after the Borealopelta, a giant dinosaur that may have been eaten by a group of Hewes' ancestors.
Among these is the 38 ft (11.5 trm) long, 6 tonne-weight canavar bear Acrocanthosaurus da var.
In his column in the journal Current Biology, scientists including Borealopelta believe that after death the denize is dragged and the mud is melted.
Yaratık was found by Shawn Funktr on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millennium Madeni's quarry near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta, Canada.
The museum says that the dinosaur is a preserved dinosaur that is extinct from its brow to its pants.
Yaratık averages around 18 ft. (five meters) and weighs up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two 20-inch-long boynuts emerge from their shoulders.
Researchers believe that this strange creature was carried by a river until it was swept away by an open dense river in what is now Western Canada.
But the dinosaur preserved the undersea tombs in perfect detail.
This particular type of fossil remains is so well preserved that its derived fragments cover the entire surface of the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, this is a rare occurrence of "getting a lottery ticket.
The more I look at her, the more incredible she becomes.
The fossil-derived fragments of the hala dinosaur skull cover the layers of the tümsekli armor, which are located at point-to-point points in the skull.

As people apply various methods to whiten their teeth, Nükhet Berk, president of the Oral Lazer Practice Association, warns against avoiding products sold in the marketplace or online.
Nükhet Berk, who noted that this type of maddeltrerin, which is sold, draws the surface of the mine, and the teeth are stained in a way that is not recycled again, says, "The whitening of teeth, the chemical components applied by dentists or the thin porcelain surfaces that are glued to the surface of the teeth, such as the takma tırnak, can be provided".
Berk noted that dental health disorders prevent the development of many diseases, that aesthetic practices are important for mental health, and that they provide both dental and dental health and a beautiful smile.
Teenage teeth are usually fairy-eyed, as long as there is no genetic factor or genetic factor in the formation of teeth.
Due to ageing, tooth decay, and frequent consumption of cigarettes, soft drinks or coy colored drinks, the teeth will turn a coy color over the years.
Whitening of teeth, applying chemical components to the surface of the teeth or toothbrushes applied to the surface of the teeth without any or minimal corrosion, can be provided with sticky thin porcelain surfaces such as takma tırnak.
Astrla should not be whitened with products sold in the marketplace or on the Internet.
Because these components will mine the surface of the earth, and will color the surface in a way that will never be recycled again.

Dear friends, at the meeting of the Yüksek Askeri Şura (YAŞ) the previous day, very interesting decisions were made, especially regarding Deniz Kuvvetleri.
This Kuvvet'in command was brought not an oramiral, but a koramiral.
Ordtrumuzda is an application that has never been seen before.
So how did that happen?
Kuvvet Commander Otramiral Bülent Bostanoğlu had filled his vacancy, and was already retired...
It's been a while.
Now the commander-in-chief was Veysel Kösele, who was then a tectra ormiral.
Veysel Paşa, who had suffered a compass injury in the past and had been in detention for some time, was supposed to be a commander in the normal rank of the army.
Or the government would not.
I'm trying to explain very clearly, Deniz Kuvvetleri'nde and the top of the starting line 1, 3, 4 and 5 are the commander's landings.
In this case, Deniz Kuvvetleri'nde became a full-fledged colonel.
Boşalan was the only one who needed to be rescued: two numbered Donanma Commander Oramiral Veysel Kösele.
So what happened after that?
Altıncı's next-in-command, Kortramiral Adnan Özbal o makama was hired by the government.
Now you have this board!
Oramiral Veysel Kötrsele is either there to help or instead is appointing a more senior commander!
Bir kıdemli, kıdemsizin emrine is a converted woman.
What will happen next?
Rütbece was superior to a major general, but a major general to his rank was inferior to his rank.
From him emir almaz, alamaz.
In this case Veysel Köseletr bu incitici duruma will not be a factor, if the retirement is not made today or tomorrow he will resign and go.
Zaten received an incentive message from the government: "Güle güle Veysel Paşa!"
Yesterday afternoon when I wrote this, news of his resignation had been spread, but the situation had not yet been officially clarified.
Now let's look at what happened again!
The government of Veysel Kötrsele'ye was therefore opposed, even removed, forced to resign and replaced the Commune with a 6th-ranked bir koramirali getirip ordumuzun, which replaced the traditional concept of "Kıdem".
There is a political agenda in the business, and we are making a fuss.
Maybe soon someone else will tell you about it and you'll learn it together!
My dear friends, I tried to explain in a very short way above, especially the Turkish ordustrunda kıdem incident is very important.
Not just as a rank.
For example, the Harp School 10th row is bitiren subay, the 11th row is older than the one that finishes.
The first-ranked tertiary edge is older than the general rank, and the second-ranked tertiary edge is older than the general rank.
Some examples of this old-fashioned event have been seen in İstiklal Harbinde.
Garp Cephesi commander İsmet Paşa...
Emrinde was in the hospital for two hours.
Ordu ve 2. ordu.
In 1922, our troops carried out a major assault and the Greek army was disbanded.
There are valuable names that are expected to be assigned to the command at this stage.
Biri Refet (Beletr) Pasha.
Kendri is offered the time command or says "İsmet is older than me, his emrine girememem".
Another name is Yakup Ştrevki (Subaşı) Pasha.
Atatürk'ün Harp Akademisinde is the home of the...
A valued and senior commander, whom he loved and valued, whom he called "Hocam", who fought in various battles.
In 1919, he was captured along with soldiers and civilian Turktr light and was driven to the island of Malta by the British.
Yurda Turunünde is reluctant to say the same thing about the commander of the army: "Battu cephesi commander is older than I am, he is emir alamam".
But Atatürk convinces him to thank him, and Yakup Şevki Pasha accepts the command of one of the two orders.
The triad is a very colorful name...
Ali İhsan (Sabis) Pasha.
A very talkative, constantly elected soldier.
He was a commander who fought in Iraq, the Kafkas, Iran and on various fronts.
O da is being deported to Malta by the British, escaping there and coming to Ankara via Kuşadası.
When Kendisine is offered the position of hourly commander, Ali İhsan Paşa says the same thing: "I am fighting on the orders of İsmet'in, who is not a senior citizen"...
The mother is still alive...
But let's see, after the start of the mission, he constantly argues with his commander of Garp Cephesi, İsmet Paşa, who is in charge, making up a mess and disturbing the people...
And shortly before the great attack, the retirement sevk was being built, replacing the sacallı Nurettin Pasha.
The relationship between Ali İhsan Pashanın and Atatürk'e never improves.
The Turkish ordusunda is not only fighting in the war, but also fighting in peace.
Of course, it should be removed.
Veysel Kösele is a good example of this.
How did an activist find the answer to the question "Soktraklar Kimin?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was found dead.
A day after arriving in New York City to visit, he sat down on the bed of an Airbnb rented apartment in St. Louis and started browsing Facebook on his phone.
Listreden thought of sharing a coin.
"Police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he was lying on the street", he said.
Surprised to find that no one else shared this information in the content stream, he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user named @TheePharoahtr takma constantly re-tweeted the billionth in his content stream.
A rapper from the St. Louis area, Michael Brown, was shot dead in Ferguson, Missouri, by an 18-year-old unarmed black, white police officer.
Brown, who was there for four hours, shared a photo of his body in the soap opera.
Fertrrell thought to himself, "Be a wildcat".
But death was not new to him or his society.
He dropped his phone later that evening to go back to tweets about a crowd gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were police banners, people crying, and photos of a man holding a banner that said "The Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!" and claimed to be Brown's father.
A police officer was watching a live broadcast of a dog barking in front of a group of protesters.
In another video, another police officer, he said, shot his rifle in the head and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals".
Fertrrell recalled saying, "This is not unusual".
"'This is not the kind of homicide we are accustomed to and can be described as typical.'
I feel like I'm a little bit of a genius.
I was in tears and grief".
He booked a return ticket and left the next day.
After the 11th night, he took his 6-year-old daughter from her father's event and decided to go with her to Ferguson the next morning.
Ferrell and Ferguson's next three films, which are set to be released on August 11, will feature a new beer entitled "Sokaklar Kimin?"
It is a story about survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the perspective of people living in society and filling the streets with answers they seek.
Ferrell, wearing a floral dress and a cup of tea, continued his conversation with his daughter to Ferguson, and that morning they returned to the conversation they had repeatedly had previously had "about the experiences of black women and the condition of black women".
"Sana, do you remember me teaching you that black people should fight for their beliefs?" he recalled.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that wasn't true.
I've been doing it all over again". Ferrell said later.
"What is happening here today... is a consequence of what happened in the past.
It should be billed, it should be done, and it should be grown in it.
Not only should we develop in the field of activism and organizing, but we must also know the catman of the black experience and its black state and know what we must do to free ourselves, freedom.
Ben Trot, lucky enough to live an experience where racial discrimination is not experienced personally, will be no different from any black woman or child.
I feel like I'm going to be doing evil to him by scaring him off his face".
When they arrived in Ferguson, their first stop was at the South Florissant Trail, which became a kind of campground for activists, waiting for the memorial Darren Wilson, who stood in front of the police station to talk about the subject that would later lead to the conviction of the offender.
There Ferrell and his daughter met local business owners who prepared packaged food.
They prepared bags and helped to transport them to the protestors.
For Ferrell, a new breed of eyeball was gradually being developed.
Noting that while a student at Missouri State University, he was president of the Azınlık Student Hemşireler Association and focused on food justice and health inequities in the black community, he said, "Eylemciliğim completely changed after August 9".
"I had no experience in organizing.
It stopped automatically".
A week later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, in an evening show.
Folayan, himself and his own video director Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, said the company was "wanting to make a move".
Ferrell's mind was struck by a question: "Do you want to be a witness or are you trying to find a story you can use?"
This suspicion was often expressed by a number of people, including the white man; a society came and made its way out of its suffering and suffering...
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson were not concentrated, and we decided to do it differently".
Folatryan, a local artist and former city manager known for his involvement with death row inmates, has already lost contact with Damon Davis.
His involvement in Ferrell's project was warm, and was followed by six other regional councillors as well as the "Sokaklar Kimin?" team in the years following Brown's firing.
David said, "But belgesel, it's not the brother who speaks for us or us; we speak live".
"For me, the most important thing is how these people are going to be represented because that's how I'm going to be represented".
Folayan, "Although not focusing on Amaç Ferrell's experiences, showed that the movement was "not about a messiah leader, it was about community coming together" and proved that the filmmakers were open, he said.
As a result, "Sokaklar Kimin?" surprisingly, like falling in love and marrying his wife, documents the personal aspects of Ferrell's life.
When Ferrell first saw the bitten product, he said, "I felt like a jerk".
"But in doing this job and making black people crazy, I realized there could be some hassle".
In addition to Ferrell's story, the Black Gay Women's role in the Black Lives Matter movement is reinforced and refocused.
Hartreketin, who posted the slogan #BlackLivesMatter on social media following the 2012 murder of young black Trayvon Martin, two of the three teenagers described themselves as homosexual.
"The leaders of these black, gay women are generally very hard-working", Ferrell said, "and we have been constantly fighting on many fronts.
Gay and lesbian women have to bear all the weight of this".
Folayan said, "The movement is really being supported by black women and many gay black women".
Yet Ferrell insists that "there is no such thing as a true, positive action" and that he was not chosen because of his identity.
"But it was the person who moved this energy", he says.
"But it's no coincidence that she's in the front row, because as a black homosexual woman, you're going to lose a lot of life living in these situations.
You can feel his energy at the screen".
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson are already gone, but there are disturbing racial connections between the community and the police.
Ferrell was under surveillance for 2.5 more years due to auto accident during a beer show.
Evim dediği in the region describes the socio-political atmosphere as "karmaşa".
Yet, Ferguson is still recording the song he wrote in his memory three years ago when he took to the streets.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
Kazanmak is our duty.
We should love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our zinc".
Kyrtrie Irving: The world is not a flat one!
Irving told NBC Sports, "The world is not a yuvarlak".
The earth is flat.
They're making people afraid and practicing these things.
Oh, my friend, I'm so sorry.
Because the more information you uncover, the more information comes out.
This is crazy.
Is the world a flat place?
Or is the yuvarlak somehow revolving around itself?
I think you should investigate this matter.
I tell you the truth, they lie to us.
They're lying to us! he used his words.
Irving, "I've been wanting to believe for years".
I knew that the world was turning.
Do you really think we are orbiting in the solar system?
There is nothing left behind in the Gonderdickler.
He's going back!
The information they give us is very inaccurate.
The real thing is here.
You only need to know this truth.
"Do you understand what I mean?" he said.
Kyrtrie Irving, who claims the world is flat, is struggling this season as a Cleveland Cavaliers forward averaging 24.4 points and 5.9 assists.
Münasiptr Bir Benzerlik: Artist, Chelsea Manning'in uses her DNA to create portraits.
In the middle of the room at the New York Fridman Gallery, there are many hundreds of white, black and brown painted cables, with the colors almost identical to the color of the other.
These 30 portraits were created by the portrait artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, using earplugs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Former intelligence analyst Manning, who was serving a 35-year sentence after leaking classified diplomatic messages via the WikiLeaks website, sent his hair cut out of Fort Leavenworth prison.
The new sergeant, named Müntrasip Bir Benzerlik, was inaugurated on 2 August.
This is the product of a two-year-long rivalry between a trans woman and her leading opponent, Manning, who was sentenced by Barack Obama to three days of school leaving to finish his duties, along with Dewey-Hagborg, who combined his discipline with technology, computer science and artistic expertise.
Using the DNA extracted from Manning'tr algorithmically analyzed and created 30 portraits of what a person with this gene data could look like, Dewey-Hagborg not only revealed the processing of DNA data (that there are many ways to determine and the determinism that comes from the essence of the interpretations), but also its chemistry, with a strict, perhaps a little brain interpretation.
Born Bradley Edward but openly describing herself as a woman as a teenager, Manning was convicted in 2013 of 20 counts of computer fraud and theft under the Casusluk Act.
The prisoner was so oppressed that he had only one photograph: Manning, who was clearly distraught, sitting in the driver's seat, a self-described platinum scarf with a wig, a black and white self-portrait.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagtrborg, and in 2012, the project Daha Garip Önseziler's had a huge success with the success of the project.
In this case, the artist produced DNA from the displays of pieces of art such as cigarette lights and a cigarette lighter to create a picture of what these people might look like.
He was just about to receive an email from Paper Magazine.
"Chelsea Manning't was doing an interview in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait that would accompany this writing", explained Dewey-Hagborg, the new sergeant's bassin's front show.
This time he was visiting the studio, his photo was with the checklist, so Chelsea reached out and sordularly felt no interest in a DNA portrait.
The artist and his inspired artist, in two years, made many correspondence exchanges and became unexpected correspondence friends.
They unveiled a cartoon book, Bastırılmış İmgeler'i, illustrated by Hatta Shoili Kanungo, in which the president is haunted by Chelsea's punishment and imagines a future in which his show can be personally seen.
A few days after Obama actually went public with Manning'in's television, a Kansas soldier was imprisoned after seven brutal years of recovering from a kind of happy tesadüftü.
While Donald Trump's administration is making new, tweetable tweets to fight back against leakage and transgender soldiers and further foment divisions that he wants to resolve, there is something deep and powerful about this current opening.
When all this was revealed in a timely manner, Dewey-Hagborg said, "It will happen for a week".
An artist's statement on the gallery wall, under which Manning's signature in large boyuts is inscribed (the "i"' in his surname is not in the heart), called for "automatic discrimination" based on gender, race, sexuality and culture.
In front of the wall was his mitochondrial DNA sequence: many C'ler, G'ler and A'lar written in lead pencils...
Including 200 letters (the artist's sophisticated science dictionary says nucleotides) by Dewey Hagborg, we all wanted to tell you how amazing we are, at least biologically, in our relationship to each other.
"What I hope people will learn from this is that they don't care about who we are in the genome and how open the genetic data is, how subjective it is", said Dewey-Hagborg, who exhibited his video work Taklit Memories in 2007.
"DNA variants of many different stories can be told and can be told in a series of stories from 30 different generations".
Tektr bir odada is a short line from the previously mentioned romandan bir sayfa.
Here Manning, King Kong, is shown taking a speech from the United States Department of Justice.
"If they have not kept your word, they have gained it", it reads.
"So never be suspicious".
"Bu, she came directly from a letter she wrote to the baby", said the artist from Philadelphia.
"But when I talk about it, my hair is thinning".
Manning has not yet personally seen the sergiyi (as is quite predictably imagined from the cartoon book), but when you see the masquerade, which is his genetic counterpart, being gathered in the middle of the odes like a group of protesters, it will sink.
Like her, her genetic haplogroups were written in Manning'in boyuna (5"2, Manning'in height), which was specially crafted.
"I've always put them against the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a fish".
"I wanted this to be seen as a movement behind his freedom, a movement shaped by Chelsea".
Cinayetten Aranıyor is a Northwestern educator and an Oxford University employee.
Police said a nationwide manhunt was launched for a Northwestern University educator and Oxford University employee who was suspected of being stabbed to death in a Chicago luxury apartment.
Cook County records show that on Monday, arrests for first-degree murder were negotiated without a warrant for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) who claimed to have played a role in the murder of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
Belgeler, a Cornell-Duranleau (26) says he died after being stabbed multiple times.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said a cesarean section was found on July 27.
Memur took a phone call, reached Grandtr Plaza Apartments and carried many deep-rooted calves in the body of the victim.
Official sources said Cornell-Durantrleau was pronounced dead at the scene and police were actively investigating the shooting as a murder.
Lathem has been a lecturer in microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of university affairs, said in an email that Lathem's administration had been granted permission to do so and that the Northwestern University campus was being banned.
"Bu, there is a criminal case under investigation by the necessary authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating with this investigation", Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
A University and Somerville University spokesperson sent an email saying, "We are still in contact with the United Kingdom police and are ready to assist US investigating authorities in any way they need".
Betryanda was also told that Warren's coworkers were shocked and wanted him to surrender.
Chicago Police Department Chief of Communications Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly urged suspects to surrender to authorities.
Guglitrelmi said, "The police had the idea that they were in the area, but they have identified them and our efforts are intensifying".
Gtruglielmi said local, regional and local authorities helped find suspects.
Guglielmi, the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a mysterious hint that something was happening in apartment number 1008, said he received a phone call from the police.
The police described the scene in a very horrific way.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He said that the security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren had been shot.
Guglielmi said, "We believe that Öğretim üyesi Latham and the victim have a relationship".
The Grand Plaza administration issued a statement to residents saying: "The police are currently working on the timeline and history of the victim and are investigating a number of incidents, including a possible family incident".
Italian, German gemisine eltr koydu
Italian police, the Iuventa, a ship engaged in search and rescue activities by the Orta Aktrenizde asylum seekers, reported the conduct yesterday on Lampedusa Island.
The police, who shared the records of phone conversations between the two members of the organization and journalists, announced that the operation was carried out as part of an investigation launched in April 2016 by Trapani Savcılığınca.

Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will soon complete the WADA roadmap"
Russian Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it would not be long before the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria were implemented to restore the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to function.
"A certain step in meeting the criteria of the roadmap has been completed, and in cooperation with RUSADA, UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping Agency) we have obtained the right to plan and test the roadmap.
WADA road map is a good day for us". said Mutko.
Başbakan, recently published on the website of the institute, was evaluating the second part of the WADA Tariff Regulatory Authority Uyumu Yol Haritası, the criteria governing the reopening of RUSADA.
According to Muttrko's, this does not include anything that would worry Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
The results will be announced by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future".
There is one criterion mentioned in the list; the Russian anti-doping authorities, approved by WADA, state-sponsored Russian sports investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, are required to publicly acknowledge the reported results.
Mutko konuya atıf yaparak commented: "While our anti-doping system admits a failure, we are conducting an investigation.
The whole tedbirler was awakened.
But there is no government program and we will not accept anything that has not been done".
Mutko'nun's words were echoed by Vitaly Smirnov, the chairman of the Russian Independent Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to Russian broadcaster RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov acknowledged past problems with Russia's anti-doping bodies, but added: "I have said on many occasions that the report contains conflicting positions and regulations.
No one is considering accepting a report as unconditional".
RUSADA's doping scandal in Russia in November 2005 was called into question by WADA.
Under the supervision of international experts and the United Kingdom Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD), the planning and coordination of these tests was allowed.
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow, WADA Director Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was "going forward" to resume operations.
100 trillion people are following!
The video of "Come to Beşiktaş" content, which was announced by Beşiktaş's Negtrredo transferini, soon reached 100 million people in 18 countries.

The President of Galatasaray is Eli Boz dönmez.
Former Galatasaray president Fartruk Süren, Mircea Lucescu'yu, who is to be transferred to the capital Ankara for the transfer of Bükreş'e and Ndiaye, was elected by President Dursun Özbek'i in a speech.
Here are the special statements made by the legendary president for the SABAH okur:
Lucescu-Özbektr talks: "We were whispering when we left".
The president of Galatasaray is not going to go back empty-handed.
The transfer is made by the Galatasaray President futbolcuya gitmez.
Futbolcu comes at the feet of the President.
Of course, when they meet, whether they are elected or not...
Whoever the actor is, the president is not at his feet.
You pay 9 million euros to the player who gets 300 bin Euro from Osmanlıspor...
It's not 7.5 million trillion, it's going to be 9 million with bonuses!
You've invested a lot, of course you'll play and it'll be 7.5 to 9...
Özbek'in icraattrları: I do not want to make a mistake.
Or the situation is right.
G.Saray's values are being eroded.
Not just football, but all approaches are wrong.
The one who will change this is the Divan Kurulu and General Kurul'dur.
As far as I can tell, they are more memorable!
Start-ups that will help your company become the next Ubertr'ar.
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of employees at an e-cigarette start-up, but the questioner was not working.
Cevaplar was generally unstable, unhelpful or even more destructive.
Anonymity pledges to some employees to process security orders.
"There was no consistency or consistency", says Errett, who runs Madison Reed, a 75-person e-cigarette brewery in San Francisco, about hairdressing.
Otrda called out to the outside staff for help.
A new type of human resources startup is emerging to help companies understand how their employees feel.
These are: producing and licensing software with a specific purpose to measure employee engagement, allowing companies to make smart, selective questionnaires, target specific groups and demographic groups, provide anonymous and complaint help lines to employees, and in some cases, allowing employees to bypass senior managers and directly the board to announce a gradual failure.
Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Glint, a Redwood City start-up that measures employee engagement by software analytics companies, said, "There are tools like Strava and Fitbit that track your health, but where is your company's Fitbit?"
Ertrrett says using Glint has helped his employees understand their thoughts and feelings better after three years.
In addition to the specialty teams' shipşak and select ankle-sniffing, it offers a heat map showing which departments of the company received the most complaints and which managers had low ratings; thus, the reasons for these can be calculated.
In order not to be the next Uber, companies are beginning to realize that employers need to know about the culture; Uber has been in a scandal ever since it described a harassment environment where those who openly say they don't think so are punished in a blog post published by a former employee.
For startups like Glint, this oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the global management, regulation and compliance industry, the financial technology industry could be worth $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Let's Talk Payments website.
Interest and activity in Denver Colorado-based startup Convertrent, which helps detect and prevent corporate misconduct, grew amid the controversies over Uber's disgrace earlier this year.
Convertr'in Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla included close to 600 customers.
Ubertr recently registered as a customer.
Convercent, like Glint, allows companies to create personalized "fast" surveys, collect real-time secret responses, and extract heat maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous helpline where employees can report bad behavior.
If the president is charged, the complainant goes directly to the board of directors.
Patrick Quinlan, CEO of Covercent, said, "You've been through the courtroom".
Quintrlan said: "If a company is not conducive to or ethical in dealing with its employees, regulators may be forced to pay for it, and consumers may face costly consequences due to boycotts, employee violence, or litigation.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 condominiums, has been using Convercent for more than a year to help employees become aware of the problems and procedures and provide easy access to the company's headquarters.
When an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find a phone number or email address from the company's headquarters, have an official complaint, and order that it be taken seriously.
Ruby Tuesday's general counsel James Vitrano, who is mostly a cowardly and uncomfortable expert, said following up on the complaints of employees was not the best way.
But now with the company's use of Convercent, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in remote offices, cities or states (such as the payment system, the payment system, or the unfair pay system) can be detected and solved more quickly.
Speaking to Ruby Tuesday's risk management group, Vitrano said: "I can get closer to the whole experience with a 360-degree perspective".
"We also protect our shareholders from business litigation".
After the 2002 Arthur Andersen accounting firm Enron scandal caused a decline in ethical values, companies took the ethics, values and employee relations consularity of 2002 more seriously, Quinlan said.
But after "social media took over", the company realized that it was impossible to make their dirty laundry go viral.
"Before technology was used to denetise ethics, people used umudu as a strategy", he said.
They offer both Glint and Convertrcent software as a service and charge repeat fees for using their products.
This is a business model and opportunity that has been approved by venture capital investors who support both startups.
Convertrcent received $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February, bringing its total capital to $47 million.
Glint, of Bessemer Venture Partners, raised $10 million in cash and raised its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are not surprising given the interconnected nature, culture and venture capital of companies.
Research by Artan Miktardaki shows that today's employees expect more from their employers than they ever expected.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just the minimum requirements.
Employees want to feel accepted, valued, and devoted to a company with a positive mission.
Nina McQueen, LinkedIn's vice president of global services and work experience, who uses Hem Convercent and Gltrint, said: "When people are happy to be in a company, when they feel their voices are heard and they are doing their job better, they become more committed to making the company successful".
Investors, their portfolio companies, make a profit when they do well; the company, its employees, and the company feel good about it.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employees' honesty and self-esteem, it's not surprising that they're getting support.
Having a reliable record of employee loyalty is important to business culture experts.
But if the truthful, the company's leaders don't act, it becomes useless.
In fact, a company can create a customer base by asking feedback from its employees about whether change is coming.
And if the client is fast enough to get through or never, it can cause disappointment and make employees feel like they're being overwhelmed.
Russell Raath, who is the chief consultant at Kotter International, a business management firm, and saw that companies made the mistake of relying too much on data collection, said: "If you want 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready for 4,000 talks".
"Because if you don't follow, the employees will think, 'Did I really hear you?
Are you a real person?
And if it's not your age, why should it be mine?'"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, a hired surveyor, was able to move on the same day that a problem was reported.
After gathering feedback from employees who were tired of the speed of decision-making and communication quality, Vetr organized various teams within the company and added communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday, the company is gaining new insights about its employees and hopes that in the long run, this type of industry known to have a high number of employees will become a more employee-owned enterprise.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're losing people", Vitrona said.
"And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.
If you lose customers, you'll lose companies".
The NCAA's two-day training cancellation means a long day for the Bruins.
It's 11 o'clock at night and a group of UCLA football players are hanging out on the side of a new training ground on campus for a chat.
Some have their uppermost moulded out, revealing their terdened backs, the hard work of the first day in the training camp.
For a significant part of the team, these empty minutes form a midday break.
After a three-hour training session, Wasserman will return to the summer classroom and take the final exams before returning to Wasserman Futbol Merkezi for the 6:30 a.m. meeting on Monday.
Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before returning to the bench on Saturday, "The next three days are a beer for these guys".
The NCAA's cancellation of two practice sessions a day, at least until Friday's final, has actually extended their days.
That's why the first three rounds of UCLA's first training session were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate the players' already busy schedule.
The reward for not having two training sessions a day is more than one coach a day; the Bruins, who started camp last season, are up by a week, and during the summer, Mora's first summer training session in six seasons at Westwood.
They plan to have 18 practice sessions by August 20 before beginning official match preparations for their opening game against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said he supported the change in NCAA rules, although a new sticker was added to the players' intensive work schedule.
Mora said: "We are putting a heavy burden on them for more than four days and it is very demanding".
"And they've been through this lately; they're working, great kids.
I think it's going to be really cool when we get to Cumartesiye, we'll have more victims".
UCLA, which will be raining its own trainers at the end of camp; the football ball in the parking lot and beside it is raining and the streets are covered with a gray net and a shovel of luxury hotels in the Luskin Center, which is a sight to behold.
The Bruins' players are scheduled to be staying at the hotel beginning this week, but Mora admits that there may be a problem with the room being evacuated during the season.
Mora said, "We're going to have a baby".
"It's not too much to think that a real workout and a roommate will rent a room and sit there and video a workout.
If you have a video recording of one workout, that's a good thing.
But we'll be safe there and we'll be safe up there in the parking lot.
We will do the same with what we have.
I won't worry about it too much.
We had a plan".
Facebook is increasing its ability to verify stories to combat fake news.
Facebook will send more potential fake news to third-party story verifiers and display their bullaws under the original share; the world's largest online social network on Thursday attempted to fight what it called fake news.
In a statement on the firm's website, it said it would use updated machine learning to detect potential fraud and send it to hikaye verifiers, potentially showing the results of hikaye verification below the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main sources of news that many consider to be fake news, which influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem of the French voters failing to support the penalty cutting plan in the event of fake news circulating in May before the presidential election and the failure of Germany to quickly remove hateful posts on social media before the election in May has become a major political issue in Europe.
In a separate statement on Thursday, Facebook Almanca said that a new story verification feature is being launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Sara Su, Facebook's product manager for news streaming, said in a blog post: "In addition to seeing which stories are being discussed by third-party story verifiers, people want more resources about what they read and share to make informed decisions".
He added that Facebook will continue to test the "linked mail" feature and work on other changes to the news feed to explain fake news.
The novel Çiztrgi oluşturmak: The story of Bir Kale'nin in England is told.
In the recent past, the Scotney Kalesi has been featured in a Squeeze music club and was a haven for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But now, a comic strip inspired by a hairy, historical novelist, and Yorkshire-born Jamie Rhodes, has witnessed a 700-year-old, vibrant history of the comfort culture in the Kent'te Bewl River valley.
"I find it beautiful to look at the handwriting of a brick that has been dead for 300 years", Ben says effarely.
"Nassil is a personal connection to the letter Elimde tutmak".
Edward's Bir Kale, a medieval English folk tale, was re-enacted in Scotland by several different artists (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg) whose stories were told in the United Kingdom.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on a British archive: Kendisi also wrote a 2014 project in the British Library, which was inspired by stories from Alan, an unexpectedly emotional project.
"I was filled with the parmak permission on the side of a letter written in the 1700s by an agent working for King James' followers", he says.
"That was his chief parmağnidi!
Mektuplar da her Zaman is kokutryor because in those days you lit a fire for light.
For 300 years, the smell of electricity has made someone feel as if they were in control.
Ah, I am paying for the archives!"
Having the support of the National Trust and the Arts Council of England as an old paper-loving sheep and being able to breastfeed for almost four months ("To be honest, I'm a little bit too hot to be greeted with a warm welcome".) seems to be a little too much.
Rhodes spent his days in the Victorian era discovering "his" castle, archivleri tarayarak and working on many treasures and antiques such as the centuries-old shişeler in the skulls and holes of the rattlesnake mounted on the walls of the mill.
Talking to coruculars, gardeners and artists working on illustrations from the book of Bazen, he toured the grounds and ruins of the old castle.
Then the geceleri "whiskey drinks and yazmaya koyulurdu".
The National Trust has not yet been able to reach the site, but details of Scotney's history are unknown as it was reached by his heiress Elizabeth Hussey when she died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived a year later, the staff had only begun to receive archival e-mails, which he describes as follows: "For centuries aristocrats have said, 'Oh, put him in the ceiling.'"
Güntrlükler, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps setting the boundaries of who and what owns: "You think the conflicts of the land will be boring.
Boştrverin be, men!" he said.
Some of the stories in the collection, including the newly built castle terk eden The Labourer, built to accommodate the 1381 Köylütr İsyanı, are used by the castle as a springboard to make a broader introduction to English history.
"This booklet, Kent and Sussex'in Şövalye Aileleri, contains a record of the rebellion of 1380", says Rhodes.
"The revolt had begun this week, and I thought that it might be a good starting point.
Maybe the two could be connected?"
Other stories are closely linked to the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family who hid a Cizvit priest for seven years during the English Invasion.
Or The Smuggler, by Arthut Darrell, an 18th-century smuggler who is thought to have been carrying his own coffin, filling a coffin with stones.
Darrell's Rhodestrun and his family in Scotland: "These beylers seemed to be very sloppy, always in debt and spending money on things they could not afford.
Darrell's men of different generations solved their debt crises by marrying wealthy older women; I imagine them as a group of handsome men who were skilled at making female curry".
Kaledeki is on a mission to bittren Rhodes, in search of other tequila yazma experience.
In the Finnish wildlife, which was the site of a sanatorium in the early 20th century, he completed a two-week work on a comic book about the life of the world that has since been reimagined by nature.
But Scotney held a special place in his heart.
"I'm sorry I was hurt", she says.
"Sanki: 'Ahtr, now I have to go and face the real life.'"
Mertral Akşener'e 'Maho'lu tepki is also known as 'Maho'lu tepki'.
Milliyetçi Hareket Party General Secretary İsmet Büyükataman recently made a written statement regarding the resignation claims made on social media and in the press about the MHP.
Using the expression "kin aktığı" by the MHP from witchcraft, social media and "some old Marxist rifles from the corners", he argued that "play and spectacle were used to prevent the Ülkücü movement from continuing to exist under the roof of the MHP after September 12".
The grandmother, said:
"The historical existence of the Turkish nation is not known, the Turk'ün country is not known, but the number of Sicilian bozuk, the criminal record is not known, the ideyatı is confused, the mind is confused and the situation is very difficult".
"Now they have resigned 410 of the management and members of the MHP Kocaeli Gölcük İlçe Teşkilatı and 215 of the MHP Bursa Yenişehir County".
Some are misdirected with unsound mesnetsiz news like 250 retreats, 300 retreats.
The newspaper columns contained lies, deceit deepened.
As there is no such number of employees in our language, the number of employees in the mentioned areas does not exceed the fingerprints of a single hand.
Büyükataman, who has a "sword" in his resignation letter, said that he was trying to misdirect the community and to get the government to do the same.
"The propaganda and campaigns of the Buns to create an MHP and an Indian ally will be thwarted", said Büyükataman.
Stating that the MHP is an important and indispensable actor in Turkish politics, General Secretary Büyükataman of the MHP said of the resignations:
The old Marxists, who are still fighting to destroy the place of the MHP in the Turkish nationalist conscience, are not strong enough.
There is a dirty account behind all the comments made, the methods of implementing the algorithm.
Because politics and the media, MHPtr has been looking at the bottom.
The fact that there are people in our party who do not work or show any kind of good work, and who are not willing to resign, has no meaning for us at this time.
Has the Nefisler resigned from the party's use of the term?
A group of people who have never touched the MHP, shared our memories, understood our country, joined our struggle, even at the very least, must find other things to do.
The unity and integrity of the Milliyetçi Hareket Partisi is a Jewish endeavor, with the persecution, competition and the struggle to overthrow the Hizbullah.
And you will be struck by the thirty-three-turn master.
Millitryetçi Hareket, despite his heavy defeats, is a strong Turk nationalist son of the Kalesias.
In a statement, Büyükataman said that "political clowns", "political manipulators", "for those who claim to target the MHPtr, the Milliyetçi movement is not without power".
"The outer microclimates that contain the roots that feed beyond the ocean will not achieve their goals, no matter the cost", he said.
MHP's Büyükataman, who used the phrase "there must be enough to make a living", said in a statement that he was aligning muhalefet partisans and terrorist organizations together, claiming: "The CHP's from the HDP's; oradan Perinçekgillere's, from the PKK's to FETÖ's, will not be able to make an operation to control the Turkish nation's own destiny".
We have been guided to new tactics and games of those who plan Turkey without MHP; we have fought to the end with the nobles who want a government without MHP, a parliament without MHP.
Now we're going to ruin the games, we're going to ruin the players.
Saying "Ülkücülüğün patent MHP'dedir", Büyükataman, Meral Akşener, used the following phrases: "Like in the movie Banker Bilo, which is made of old Yeşilçam, Maho farmers say I'll take them to Germany, after days of wandering around in a truck case, how he left Istanbul on a mountain ridge, followed by the giggling Zatin dismissals, I'm taking you to work, and it's obvious he'll leave you on the edge of a cliff".
It's their thing, but it's our duty to keep the guitar in place.
Kjaer Sevilla'ya is a good example of this.
Kjaer signed a contract with the Sarı-lacivertli team for a €12.5 million transfer to Sevilla and the Spanish team for a costly defence transfer.

The baby is coming to THY'den with great ease.
According to a statement from THY Basın Müşavirliği, the national airline company that keeps its passengers' flight comfort and comfort in mind and works to make them feel more comfortable during the flight, continues to develop new ideas for a perfect travel experience.
In this regard, the "baby travel kit", which is designed to meet the needs of infants and their families aged 0-2 years, has been launched in August with the launch of the baby travel kit, which is designed to meet the needs of infants and their families who travel on intercontinental flights.
A specially designed bag with a suitcase is included in the kit; a change of clothes, a single-use mother's towel, a cat cream, baby lotion and shampoo, a yenidoğan ıslak pamuk mendili and göğüs pedi yer yerıyor.
Products that do not contain paraben, alcohol, paint or harmful chemicals, were produced taking into account the difficulty of baby cildinin.
Washington is changing the Green Card rules.
According to a media agent, President Donald Trump has said there will be a new immigration plan in the United States that changes the Green Card rules.
Yatra is reducing the number of immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules for temporary work permits and restrictions on family visas.
The new curriculum was proposed by the Republicans and endorsed by the president.
The Tastrlak law will be debated in the Canadian Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save taxpayers billions of dollars by changing the way citizens of other countries in the United States give out their Green Cards.
The new law will be implemented and will replace the current regime.
This new application process will be beneficial to English-speaking candidates, those who have the financial resources they can afford and the talents that will benefit our economy", Trump said, according to an American media actor.
Yazarlar has interpreted the Fenerbahçe-Sturm Graz match.
Two seasons I couldn't bear, I couldn't see coşkuya ve görkeme again Kadıköy...
A team of "mangal-hearted" men, who were brought out of the yokluks by Aykut Kocamantr, were ready to make a "back to us" deal with their supporters.
We can bring criticism to the game, positions or performances, or I haven't seen a game like this in a long time.
The first match was played either yesterday or yesterday, after the apostrophe was taken by the Fenerbahçe's own commanders; the sahadaki commander is now Valbuena.
The age of transfer was a problem, but in Kocaman's words there was the phrase "unforgiving character".
Thirty years ago, we gave the name of the atomic nucleus to Rıza Çalımbay.
If he understands, the French actress will be in a very interesting position.
She took her place in the world, joined all the passport organizations, took responsibility and scored a few goals and put on a short boyuna dev show.
Alper's lead play, in the second foreword position, left the Sturm Graz team "kısıtlı" on the field for a long time.
Fenerbahçe devreyi corner from the atma galip kapatırken such serves a constant formula for the walls to break.
They are either not judges or somehow cannot produce an effective passport in the field of competitive punishment.
This image may bring the "santrfortr lazım" message, or Ahmethan'a pas atmakta tereddüt eden, in which the tek santrforun position is the one we face against the so-called "santrfortr".
Either the team didn't trust the young player or their performance needed to be improved a bit.
After a 1-1 draw, the two netizens missed out on the opportunity.
It was important to pass the ball or the fans who were standing by and applauding the players' struggles would make the night even better by raising the ball to the "goal".
There will probably be 1-2 more transfers until then.
But the reality is that Fenerbahçe's biggest need is 12 numbers...
We are about to enter a season of great joy and joy with this style of play that carries the hearts of the players who are trying to play.
Aykut Kocaman is working on his machine, but he needs a little more time.
They are in good physical condition.
The quality of the game will improve.
You can see that the confidence of all the football players in the Sahara has increased.
They need a lot of applause for a new beer page.
The rise of sex robots is real and we need to hear about it.
Thinking 2017 is even more exciting, a new report on technological developments in the sex robot sector is being released.
Yes, it is.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Sorumlu Robot Knowledge Center (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
Noel Sharkey, retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and one of the founders of FRR, said: "We take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nose and the type of nail.
Speaking about the release of the new report, Bay Sharkey said: "People are laughing at them but they are actually firms and we will see more of them".
Modern sex dolls, like the similar and more modern ones, evolve into robots with a particularly human-like reaction, made by artificial intelligence.
Users can also customize their robots to suit their needs by choosing everything from eye color, meme nose shape, and nail type to color.
But with so many robots having "kissilkers" that they can make Stepford Kadınıtr innovative, this is becoming even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls are silicone derivatives of robots to evrildrillers.
For example, the RealBotixtr robot allows users to customize their own robots according to the characteristics they find attractive (such as the shyness).
Then there were Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, with programmed characters, including the "Frijit Farrah" and "maceracı" sex robots with the "Vahşi Wendy" characters.
True Companion's website says: "Roxxxy Gold'un, you have a personality that fits your personality as much as possible".
So if you don't love him, you love him, and if you don't love him, you don't love him, etc.
Also, there are the same real people as the soul halleri in the day.
You can make a speech, you can make a speech or you can make a "tam modunda".
There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots: not only does it replace real human relationships, but it also overly affects the feminine personality traits, the tecavüzsel calls and the thought-provoking ones that Frijit Farah approaches.
On the True Companion website, Roxxxy is a popular vibrator for men.
"If a woman can (and does) have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" the website states.
It's not that these sex robots are just a fetish or sex toy.
Their appearance and artistic complexity point to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat towards sexual desire through bondage, an optional element of the ideal of gender equality.
Many men will naturally not be attracted to sex robots, and FRR has drawn attention to their growing popularity and is now a part of the consumer culture.
But, leaking from the edges, it can be highly informative about the course of the times in which we live.
Many people, however, are not at all weird or aggressive until the free market gives them the right to be so.
It is no coincidence that the Beyaz Saray has a president who boasted of sexual assault on women and that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights are under threat worldwide.
The Handmaid's Tale TV series is not about the details of the illustrator, the sketch book or the eyepiece, but how realistic the image makes it feel.
The Republic of Gilead and a change, but at the moment it doesn't feel like such a big change.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create as much physical similarity as possible to real women (of course, in proportion to porn star numbers) as technologically possible.
They want their creators, their children, to give them a human feeling and to imitate the movements of a real body.
But when it comes to their "little ones", robots clearly do not represent real women.
They do not separate from their wives or abandon them.
Nothing will reveal their independence or ruin their fantasy of total slavery.
In other words, they are merely enjoyable slaves.
And the 2017 yearbook is cariyeler.
American military convoy attack: The wounded and injured were...
In a suicide attack in the capital, Kabil'in Karabağ, the country's foreign military was targeted.
It was reported that 1 NATO soldier and 3 civilians were killed in the blast, including 5 wounded American soldiers on the convoy and 1 translator working with NATO forces.
An official statement by NATO's Resolute Support Force in Afghanistan said that NATO forces had detonated a suicide bomber during a joint deployment with the Afghan National Army.
It was revealed that the injured personnel were being treated at the American Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
The lives of the injured are being saved by the technology.
The suicide bomber in the Yerel basin is believed to be a Taliban operative.
Trump's great maharat?
Mitt Romney is being shown as a good-looking actor.
The micro-scale family division of the political divide that has polarized the U.S. electorate has become a reality during the Trump era.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the United States were filled with questions about how to deal with the family tragedy that Trump was facing.
We're all just trying to blow our own filtered balloons.
Less talked about is Trump's ability to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a poet with a strong sense of humor who lives in Şiktrago and is a Republican-led bozuk in our country, is visiting New York this week.
Bana, he reminded, could be a powerful force if a union against a common enemy is formed.
Everyone he knew, including his Republican brother, with whom Trump had been arguing for decades about Beyaz Saray's policy, suddenly and oddly seemed to be on the same page.
This is of course a good thing for dinner; but it seems that in a broad context this carries significant risks.
Sol was a lightweight, but the twisting effect of his presidency created a right-handed power for the hepim.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we are talking about the terrible possibility that one day his bizarre behavior will no longer shock us.
There is even a more terrifying long-term scenario where Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who are against his standards, and these seem to be a symbol of logic.
I find myself nostalgic for the crazy version of Mitt Romney's insanity: the dog on the roof of the car, 14% income misstatement (or at least we knew what his tax was or was not), both of which are really very lightly charged by Trump.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate needs to be sane to assess whether he has achieved an immeasurable degree of development.
When we were kids, we took our kids to the athletic fields in Central Park, the largest athletic complex operated by the New York City Department of Parks, and the three best rounds you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
Atlar is vastly larger, center-cylinder fiberglass designs (clowns and animals who make scary pictures turn to bang their shoulders) and tıngırdayan music acayip form of coquelucu.
In other words, many clichés can be disappointing in a city: the views of the high country are becoming boring, the coastline is becoming too familiar to create much excitement, and the reality of the city is falling into disrepair.
It's been thirty-five years and I've never fully recovered from the day I discovered that Swiss Cottage is not actually a Swiss country house but a large turnover in North London.
The athleticism in Central Park is a strange and magical experience, so that two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go here and have a great time.
If I hadn't been able to do it, I wouldn't have given it to her, but thankfully no one asked.
On the other hand, this week before I transferred my credit card, I was asked to rate the transaction "denyimimi" between 1 and 5 stars.
The same thing happened at the coffee shop on the corner of Sokağımın, with a 15% option to pair a bag; for what you bought from a tezgaht...
This has the effect of not only slowing down the need for a neutral shopping, but also of creating a personal touch that is not needed at all on the server.
The poor woman in Bonmarshedeki stood up and smiled like an apology dealer, and in her hand, a credit card and a five-star rating.
The temperature is 41 degrees, and the winds are blowing.
Tunceli'de folk, who had one of the hottest days of the Mevsimin, looked out over the beaches of Munzur.
From noon onwards, with the heat rising, young, children, old, men and women, who were swimming on the beaches along the Munzur River, tried to escape the heat by squeezing themselves in ice-like waters.
The beach dolupos on the Munzur River have been hit by the plajtrup, especially as Tuncelili citizens living in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France and England have been spending their holidays in their home countries instead of the Aegean or Akdeniz.
Suna Tosun, who was among the serintrleyen on Munzur Plaj, pointed out that he used the tercihini Tunceli'den in place of the batti'ri for tatil, stating, "Ben batida tatilimi geçirmek istemedim ailece Munzur'da serinlemek, in our own land it was more accurate to speak".
"Munzur'un ice-like water is not found anywhere else in the world, and Munzur lives in these temperatures serinletiyor", he said.
Hasan Ulutr, from Germany, said that instead of the Çeşme or Bodrum sails, they preferred the Tunceli'de Munzur River and therefore do not regret it.
Oscar Pistorius was taken to the hospital with chest pains.
This is the second time Pistorius has been imprisoned for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to hospital for treatment of kidney stones in his bicle that he said were caused by falling from the cell of the prison officials.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after the previously brutal murder trial was contested by the lawyers.
In the early hours of Sevgililer Day 2013, Steenkamp killed himself in Pretoria, by shooting a toilet at the door of the toilet several times.
Pistorius had alleged that he had confused his girlfriend with someone who had entered the room uninvited while on a night watch.
Savcılar, who they considered too light this time, announced that they intend to protest once again against Pistorius' six-year sentence.
Ulusal Kovuştrturma Mercii, South Africa's Supreme Court, said it would appeal the decision and the appeal could be considered this year.
Pistorius, if the savages succeed, will face up to 15 years in prison.
In South Africa, there is no death penalty.
The first hactr caravans were dismissed.
The pilgrim candidates who are to travel to Saudi Arabia, organized by the Diyanet Affairs Ministry, were greeted with a double and tearful welcome at the Atatürk Havalimanı Ekst Hatlar Gidiş Terminal.
The ceremony, held at the External Hatlar Terminal before the first Hajj kafilesinin parade, was attended by about 200 pilgrims, as well as their relatives and citizens.
Öte yandan Türk Hava Yolları (THY), a charter aircraft, distributed körükte gül to pilgrim candidates heading to kutsal territory.
The Hactral convoy in Ankara was also dismissed from Esanboğa'dan.
Kafile'de, for the first time this year, included martyrs and their relatives who benefited from the application "kurız hac for Gaztriler and martyrs' relatives".
Two Bulgarian Foreigners from the Yapma Camp were arrested in Greece.
According to the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and quoted by bTV, two Bulgarian illegal camps were arrested in Greece on the grounds of the yapma.
A group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians, were arrested by police in the early morning of 1 August in Sithonia.
While the Soruşturma is still going on, they were released on the same day.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarian bTV'trye was later abandoned.
The Greek authorities have tightened their controls over camp yapma free of charge and severely imprisoned those who rest in areas not designated for their purpose.
Controls will be carried out throughout the Mevsim.
The minister, the judge, said he could be fined.
We will not return to the Netherlands until the United Nations has declared a peace.
JOEY Hoffman (22), at the beginning of July, went to Turkey to visit with two friends.
Joey Hoffman, the alleged driver of the Adtrana and Mersin'i geese, disappeared on July 8 in Silifke'de.
After his friends arrived, despite all the calls, Hoffman was unable to reach his family in Holland.
While the police were on a mission to find missing tourists, his brother Robin Hoffman and his friends Angelo Durei and Jaimy Gewaldtr went to Adana'ya.
İLANLAR BASTIRIP DAĞITTI is the first to be born.
Robin Hoffman, who had applied to the police here, distributed missing persons to the bastirarak Adana and Mersin'de in order to find her brother.
Robin Hoffman, a former police officer, said on July 8 that he had "applied the police to the Netherlands".
Later, two friends from Turkey and I came here and applied for the police.
So far, we have not received any news or found any clues.
"We will stay in Turkey until there is a news report", he said.
Second World Ayşe Ctreren'e bakandan tebrik is also a good one.
At the 2017 Paletli Yüzme Gençler World Championships in Russia, the national athlete Ayşe Ceren Yeşilbaş became the second world record holder over 400 metres.
Gençlik and Spor Bakanı Osman Aşkın Bak congratulated the silver medal winner Ayşe Ceren Yeşilbaş with a message he posted.
On the first day of the 2017 Paletli Yüzme Gençler World Championships in Russia, Ceren Yeşilbaş became the world record holder over 400 metres.
Ceren, who finished second with a spectacular performance in the race with eight finalists, missed the gold medal by just 27 sails.
In the 400 metres gold medal event, Elena Lopatina won the 03.18.73 minute medal from Russia, while Ceren won the silver medal with a 03.19.00 medal.
Turkey is represented by eight male and eight female athletes in the championship.
Sontr's words became 'I'm dying, goodbye anne'.
Among those killed in the Grenfell Tower fire in London, which was reportedly on the 30th, the younger brother immediately called his mother and said, "I don't want to die Anne, it's not fair".
"Thank you for doing this for me, goodbye", was the Italian Gloria Trevisan and her seven-year-old daughter's statement.
After the fire, dozens of people were reported missing, including Gloria Trevisan, 26, and Marco Gottardi, a former Italian businessman, who were sitting on the 23rd floor of the 24-story building.
Maria Cristina Sandri, the lawyer for the Trevisan family in northern Italy, said in a statement that, according to reports from British officials, the two generations had lost their lives.
A lawyer, who said the youngsters' families were suffering greatly, urged journalists not to insist on seeking explanations.
I think I am dying, elveda annetr
Sandri's lawyer said Gloria called her sister Emanuela Trevisan shortly after the fire broke out and that she cried when she heard the audio recordings.
According to Gloria Trevisan, local sailor spoke to Annesile several times for two hours after the fire started around 1 a.m.
Trevisan, who indicated that he was calmer in his first talks, said, "Anne, bad things are happening here, there's a fire".
We're stuck, we can't get out.
There is a bit of a smell, but don't worry, we are waiting to be rescued.
"We tried to get out the door, but there was too much smoke and the elevator was not working", he said.
In subsequent calls for help from the burning fire, Gloria Trevisan's last words were reportedly:
Anne, my whole life has been spent in front of me.
I think I'm dying.
I had a life to live in the future; it's not fair.
I don't want to die and I want to help financially.
I'm sorry I won't be able to see you again.
Thank you for all you have done for me, goodbye Anne.
Bentr, I'm going to heaven now and I'm going to help out there.
This is the Italian government's hattrası.
Both of her architectural trainings include Gloria Trevisan and her boyfriend Marco Gottardi, who, after graduating last year, had to find work, moving from the Veneto region in the north of the country to London in March.
Gloria Trevisan, who had a job with a salary of only 300 euros, soon started working in London with a salary of 1800 pounds (about 2060 euros).
Advocate Sandri said Gloria Trevisan's family was having a hard time financially, "Gloria had gone to London to help her family".
Unfortunately, our youth are forced to leave the country to save their future and find work.
"The government is so concerned that a solution must be found immediately", he said.
The drama of Italy is not about giving young people jobs.
Gloria's father, Loris Trevisan da enfkesini, said, "Bu, it's the fault of our government that forced our youth to flee abroad to find work".
Italy's unemployment rate is 12 percent, while the youth unemployment rate is over 40 percent.
In the wake of this growing crisis, in recent years many young Italians, especially in England, have begun to emigrate to many European countries.
Last year alone, the number of young people forced to leave Italy due to unemployment exceeded 110 million.
Commentaries in the Italian press on the confirmation of the death reports of Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gotttrardi pointed out that this was a tragedy of a country that did not provide jobs for its youth.
Red and, dairy products and chocolate are easily breathable.
Red and chocolate may sound like a nightmare to your digestive system.
But a new study claims the opposite: A diet rich in protein-based foods and dairy products may help alleviate the symptoms of people suffering from bowel disease.
This untreated health condition, affecting 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes seizures and swelling, dizziness, weight loss and fatigue.
Patients are usually advised to ease their symptoms and to supplement milk products, and researchers at the University of Washington found that the protein helps develop the immune cell that develops the essential amino acid tryptophanin, a resistant liver.
Chief investigator Dr. Marco Coltronna said that the microbes stored in the immune cell celline travel through the intestines to enter the body's muscles.
The cell that is capable of triggering the inflammation stimulates the endurance of the cell by protecting the tissues of the damaged tissue.
If you go too far in the direction of the intestinal tract, the resulting intestinal disease may occur.
In the intestines, a type of immune cell was found to be present that promotes resistance in the intestines of rats carrying a specific bacterium.
And bacteria need tryptophan, one of the building blocks of protein, to trigger the formation of cells.
Professor Colonna: 'The link between the bacterial species Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the Bağırsak microbiome, and the development of the cell population promoting endurance is very strong.'
Those with more tryptophan in their diet have more immune cells.'
If the same thing happens in humans, L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan suggested that a more durable, less milky gut environment could be developed.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, while working on a type of immune cell that improves endurance, discovered that a group of deney farces had such cells but that the same type and other groups in different locations did not.
He suspected that the difference was related to the gut microbiomes of the rats, or in other words, the bacteria, viruses and fungal communities that normally live in the mid-myocardial canal.
DNA sequencing of the intestines of the rats was done and it was found that rats with immune cells had six types of bacteria but that this was absent in those without them.
Because they were bred in a sterile environment, L. reuteri was given to those who lacked an intestinal microbiome and did not develop such an immune cell, and immune cells were formed.
To understand how the bacterium affects the immune system, researchers enlarged L. reuterium in a liquid and then acted on the immature immune cells of the patient in smaller amounts than this fluid, which was unbactericidal.
Immunity cells were transformed into resistance-enhancing cells.
When the active compound was diluted with liquid, it was found to be a byproduct of the metabolism of tryptophan, known as indol-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the kidneys of rats, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells was halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that humans have cells that promote the same endurance as humans and that they have L. reuteri in their mid-to-late digestive tract.
It is not known whether the triptofan side products from L. reuteri'tr developed in humans and rats as well, but the triptofan-related genus of glucose has been found in humans with irritable bowel disease.
He said: "The development of these cells is something we probably want to promote because these cells control the inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in cases where L. reuteri is present cause this population to spread".
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed Nemanja Matic with a 'old' player.
After making his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening, midfielder Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed a "back" with Nemanja Matic.
Chelsea's £40 million transfer, United's 2-1 victory in Dublin ahead of the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, in their last preseason game, began to blossom and, according to Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira, the forward had to hold the position of attacking midfielder.
Matic, who was left out of the pre-season Asia tour, had a serious match condition and was only able to score 45 minutes; Mourinho admitted that this needed to be improved before the Premier League season began.
"Vakte needs experience, intelligence, a sense of humor... or football is thinking", Mourinho said.
"We're going to help her get ready early".
As Mourinho began to shape his first 11'ins for the start of the season, like Matic, new transfer mates Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku came out at Aviva Stadium.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more transfers but the club had already insisted that he had done an "extraordinary job" by completing three of the four priority transfers.
"Thank you to the club for taking three days", he exclaimed.
"I'd be happier if four out of four went, but they put a lot of effort into it for me".
Last year, 197 people were hospitalized.
According to the ISVEÇ Social Refah Kurumu, the number of reported sexual misconduct per person in 2005 rose to 8 percent in 2015.
Astrid Lindgren Childhood Hastanesi's gender dissatisfaction with childbirth last year was mostly children and adolescents, 197 of whom were diagnosed.
The same hospital's pediatric psychiatrist Loustrise Frisen pointed out that the growth could stem from the emergence of a more open society, saying, "Questions about sexual identity and the subsequent openness to psycho-sexual content can be seen as a general improvement in society".
Cinsiyet dissatisfaction disorder has no connection to sexual orientation or any kind of sexual orientation.
İzmir'de drug operation is underway.
Ödemiş İlçe Emniyet Müdürlüğü Kaçakçılık and the teams of the Organize Suçlarla Mücadele Bureau, on the 3rd Eylül Mahallesi Ülker Sokak'taki 36 year old F.T.'in had an operation on the ihbar.
In the event of an emergency, 33 extacy hap and a few hassas were passed to the terrace.
F.T., who was trying to escape from Baltrkondan, was detained in Yakalanarak.
F.T.'in security transactions were recorded to be delivered to the client.
Evkur is the new Malatyasportr'da transfer.
Evkur Yeni Malatyaspor, one of the new teams in the Süper Lig, has been linked to the colours of the former Kasımpaşa-shaped rower Turgut Doğan Şahin'i.
According to a statement from Sarı-siyahlı kulüpten, the 29-year-old sailor was signed to a two-year contract as part of the transfer work.
In a statement, "Kastrımpaşa'da formed a two-year contract with the Turkish armed forces leader Turgut Doğan Shah.
Yeni Malatyaspor'umuza hayırlı olsun". the terms were used.
British musician Bir eltr el hareketiyle took a microchip to get into his car.
A British citizen became the first person in the country to be given a microchip so he could open his front door, access his office, and even run his car with only one electrical device.
Steven Northam (33), who switched the mini-chip between the right and right fingers, now offers the service to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology using the BioTeq protocol.
To ensure that the implant procedure is consistent with medical standards, he worked with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at Winchester, Hants'teki Royal Hampshire County Hastanesi.
The technology is similar to a microchip attached to cats and dogs and lasts only 30 seconds.
Baytr Northam's company will make changes to the keys on the e-wallet and in vehicles at £300 per lock to make the chip compatible.
Evli and the father of one child took this technology to the BMW Z4 and now the driver is working on the day.
Beyaz Saray shows the Vergi Mükelleflerine with the Binlere Mal Oldu
According to military records released to TIME, Beyaz Saray's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the southern slopes of the country for an organization that promoted American production last month cost taxpayers up to $24,000.
At the presidential inauguration, the green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, was the focus of interest at the organization that introduced the American construction programs on July 17 at Beyaz Saray.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior members of the White House visited the products produced in all 50 states.
Helicopters made in Connecticut, Maintr'den yachts, Wisconsin fire trucks and Mississippi forklift trucks are also on the way.
According to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), which operates helicopters; Beyaz Saray Harp Dairesi, helicopter owner of mevcudiyetini münferit bir emirle (FRAGO da deniyor) has requested that the helicopter "go on" for the organization of the "agağandışı" to enter the southern slopes just 36 hours ago.
The day before the organization, HMX-1's commander, Deniz Piyadesi Havacılık Komutan Vekili'ne, sent an email saying, "I just wanted to make sure you were aware because this is an unusually high visibility organization".
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive at the lawn at around 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. organization and would stay there until the lawn was cleaned between 6 and 9 p.m.
Not, Beyaz Saray'tr was delayed from departure, but added that due to duty time constraints, a second flight crew would be needed for the return flight.
While the Birim security personnel were on the ground, while the aircraft was still in flight, the original flight crew died in a helicopter during the organization.
From the records provided to TIME, it is unclear whether a second flight crew was necessary.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using public funds for political purposes.
The registrar, HMXtr-1'in, indicates that the organization is investigating whether or not it has complied with this requirement.
The commander wrote, "We were told that the Hatch Act did not and did not address a question".
"That seems to be the case with you", said Commander Vekili.
The "Made in America" organization has been designated by Beyaz Saray as an official beer organization and is not covered by the Hatch Act.
But official organizations are becoming political.
The organization's president, then-Senate, and current health care reform efforts were praised and praised the government's efforts to reverse regulation.
The use of air carriers known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents need to use these to travel.
But it is unusual for these to be used for just one photo opportunity.
Trump had come to the fore in February when the presidential plane went behind the scenes of the first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and when he took into account that his Twitter account was full of messages about the use of the presidential plane.
Lindsay Walters, deputy spokeswoman for the Beyaz Saray Basin, said: "Beyaz Saray, 50 outlets are excited about the 'Made in America' exhibition, which features American workers making products of American materials".
The HMX-1 crew frequently makes training flights in the Washington area and exercises to drop the US President Beyaz Saray with a point-blank range in the southern hemisphere.
Trump has launched 58 missions to Germany's HMX-1 Beyaz Saray for the G20 summit in early July.
One official, who was on a flight for the Made in America organization, said the aircrew needed training within a month.
Birim helicopters fly for 11 hours a day for "mainly unrelated support personnel".
Beyaz Saray, the taxpayer, said that they did not charge for any other number included in the organization.
A spokesman for Siktrorksky said that his companies did not participate in the settlement of the helicopter's southern grasslands.
HMX-1 tracks budget records for presidential flights and makes it difficult to determine the exact cost of the organization.
But according to the Department of Defense's 2017 fiscal year estimates, the Department of Defense's VH-3D is currently charging $24,340 per flight hour.
Birim records record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from its headquarters in Quantico, Virginia, to both sides.
Beyaz Saray claims that the real business cost of helicopters is far below that.
"For taxpayers, it is very tempting to deduct a fee based on cost-benefit estimates", Walters said.
"These estimates cover the total costs of personnel, maintenance and annual expenses".
A 2015 RAND study found that the Department of Defense's cost-sharing rates do not include personnel costs, but include fuel, gas and contract costs.
In the past, Sean Spicer, former spokesman for Beyaz Saraytr's former base, advocated the use of the helicopter for this organization.
"Burada thought about showing things that are done in America this week", Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contributions to our national security, and I think that even without biner, hundreds of people's work is tied to that.
And I think we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that many Americans, like most Americans, have worked tirelessly to make.
So, of course, it is appropriate to remove it".
Not only did Trump interact with the helicopter that was passing through the grasslands for the organization, but he stepped into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
In the Beyaz Saray, Trump, the media and Sikorsky spoke to representatives of the company about the firm's products in his philosophy.
"I know Sikorsky very well", the president said, "and I had three of them too".

With Ligue 1 side Paul Pogba ready to break the world transfer record, more than double the amount he returned to Manchester United last season for £89 million, the sensational offer has set the transfer window on a roll.
With PSG offering a weekly salary of £500,000 after the transfer, it shows that once completed Neymar will be the world's most expensive player and also the highest paid professional athlete.
A source close to the Catalan government, Santos, has insisted that since his arrival in 2013, the club has always done everything in its power to keep an eye on him, but Barcelona is angry at the way in which the club has been trying to break up with Neymar.
Well, was the football world warned about this feast three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City's Blaise Matuidi expressed his interest in signing in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a warning to all clubs who wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.
Al-Khelaifi said, "Ben is not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we will then face them, contact their players".
"We respect all the clubs.
But if he tries to sign one of our players, they will suffer the consequences".

After the two prosecutors were fined, the prosecutors appealed.
The case is pending before the İstanbul Bölge Adliye Mahkemesi 23.
Ceza Dairesi'ne is here.
The court, which completed its injunctions, ruled that the sentence for the crime of "hakaret" against Kenan Gültrşen was applied in the legal context, that the action was correctly interpreted and that the crime was a crime under the law, and that the appeal court had given the essential ruling that the sentence against him was appropriate.
"Ne ezanı, ne selası, milleti soka" is a phrase spoken by Ağır Ceza Mahkemesi when he meets Imam Mustafa Baki, who is coming out of the cell of Sanık Nait Yılmaz's cell.
The President has been taken.

The district, which stated that the alleged victim's cell and reading duties were performed while he was briefing the public before the mosque, despite the reasons given by the local court, said that in such cases, the victim had neither begun nor continued any work, had not been charged with attempting to commit a crime against the victim because of the public duty he performed, and had not been able to explain or demonstrate how the defendant had been able to access the investigation to provide evidence that would prevent the victim from performing his tasks.
The court said that the fact that the case was unfounded, that the victim did not suffer material harm as a result of the crimes committed against him, and that the manoeuvre did not prevent the execution of the sentence from being reversed, and that it was not discussed whether it would be enforced if the victim had withdrawn from the complaint.
HÜKÜM BOZULDU, DOYA GERİ GÖNDERİLDİ The appeals of the lawyer of Sanık Nait Yılmaz's claim that the judgment against the defendant was invalidated were invalidated by the court of first instance.
