The American Plan was based on regular attacks launched from three different points.
General John Cadwalder would start a gowner taarruz against the British garner in Bordentown to become a mani for any reinforcing power.
General James Ewing will take 700 spindles along the river in Trenton Ferries, will zap the bridge on Assunpink Deresi and escape any enemy troops.
