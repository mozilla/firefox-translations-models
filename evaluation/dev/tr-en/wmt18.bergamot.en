Last minute: Our Cosmic Visitor Giant Asteroid 2014 JO25
There are billions of, maybe more giant asteroids in the Solar System, wandering around, which can cause serious consequences when it hits.
These objects, which can have closed or open orbits from the formation of the Sun, can sometimes pass through the Earth.
The 650-meter-diameter asteroid 2014 JO25 is such a visitor, and today at 14:24 p.m., it will pass through 1.75 million km, the closest location to the Earth.
We've been hearing about this kind of news more and more.
The most important reason for this is observation techniques and developments in observation instruments.
In this way, we also have the opportunity to identify smaller-sized asteroids of aerialities that have not been determined before.
Last January, for example, a bus-sized asteroid, only half of the Earth and the Moon had passed a distance of 250,000 km.
And even more interesting asteroid was only detected a few days before the transition.
So there might be other cosmic buses coming at us right now.
Imagine what do you do if you're aware of the fact that an asteroid with a diameter of 20 meters is going right in the middle of your neighborhood?
In fact, this size of asteroids won't destroy your neighborhood, but the windows of all the buildings will probably explode.
This will be due to shock waves emitted from the asteroid that will detonate in the atmosphere.
For example, the asteroid that crashed into Russia in 2013 was of this size and was enough to smash the windows of buildings in several cities.
But if you're in the target of a 100-meter-diameter asteroid, your advice is to go at least 50 miles from your neighborhood.
Criteria such as the size and impact angle of the asteroid are the depth of the crater that determines the damage caused by the impact.
Let's take a look at a few scenarios according to the simulation of the European Space Agency.
If an asteroid with a diameter of 100 m hits Earth at a 45-degree angle at a temperature of 60 km per second, a crater with a depth of about 250 meters and a diameter of 1200 meters will be formed.
The impact is equivalent to the magnitude of 6 on the Richter scale, and even if you are 10 km away from the impact point, your body has a third-degree burn.
Those who are 50 kilometers away will be waiting for the fragmented window windows.
If an asteroid hits a mile-diameter, it'll get more depressing.
If such an asteroid hits Earth with the same angle and speed value, a crater of about 600 meters deep and 12 km in diameter is formed.
So a whole neighborhood turns into a crater and disappears instantly.
Even if you are 100 km away from the impact point due to the heat generated by the impact, your body has a 3rd degree burn.
The impact is equivalent to an earthquake of 8 magnitude on the Richter scale.
The damage to the asteroid depends not only on the chemical composition of the asteroid, but also to the rock structure of the area where it will hit.
The above values are given in accordance with the scenario that arises if a hard rock-like asteroid falls into a region of sedimentated rocks.
If the asteroid is mostly made of iron, if it falls to a place with the surface formed by the cooling of the lava, the crater size will increase by 3 times, and the catastrophe that has arisen will be doubled.
66 million years ago, something worse happened to the dinosaurs, and they were hit by an asteroid with a diameter of about 10 km.
Due to the asteroid impact, 75 percent of sea and land creatures were instantly destroyed.
If an asteroid that destroys dinosaurs is targeting Earth, then rest assured, leaving the planet will be the strongest option.
Tons of matter fall on Earth every day from space.
Most of them burnt into the atmosphere.
Some asteroids, which are large enough, burn in the atmosphere, causing glare known as star shifts among the people.
Let's end our article with another news that will relax.
Studies show that for the next 300-400 years, a giant asteroid is not expected to hit Earth, which will cause serious destruction.
As creatures that live on average for 70 years, I'm sure you're relieved.
Flash claim for Medel: 10 million euros!
The name on the Black and Whites who want to reinforce the stopper zone is Gary Medel, who is definitely considered leaving Inter...
The 30-year-old footballer, who went on vacation after wearing a jersey in the Chilean jersey and recently re-run with Inter, is waiting for future offers to him.
Gazzetta dello Sport, one of the prestigious Italian newspapers, suggested that Beşiktaş made an offer to Inter for Medel, who was able to serve in both the stopper and the front libero region.
It was stated that the Black and Whites, who offered Medel's offer, were waiting for answers from both sides, while Chilean footballer was warm to live with his family in Istanbul.
Despite Gazzetta's claim, Black Eagle, which is the FFP limitation, is difficult to pay a price of 10m euros for Medel.
As in the Caner Erkin transfer, there is a possibility that the black-and-whites will turn to Medel by rent or if a serious discount is received in the bonus, the star player will be added to the squad.
Beşiktaş Negredo transfer to the stock market
Human rights group releases travel warning for Missouri
The National Society for the Progress of People of Color issued a warning for colorful people who will travel to Missouri for the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Recommendation in the province of Missouri, valid from August 28, 2017, allows African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri people to take special attention and be extremely cautious when traveling from the beginning to the end, as mentioned there, as mentioned there,"
NAACP said that a new Missouri law makes it difficult for people to win discrimination cases, while at the same time, the state's legal practices disproportionately targeting minorities, is effective in the group's publication of this travel warning.
"There are human rights violations that happen to people.
They're being stopped, beaten and killed because of the color of their skin," said Rod Chapel, president of Missouri NAACP, to Kansan City Star.
"We hear complaints as much as we've never heard of."
This is the first time the Association has issued such a warning for a state in the United States.
The group cites racist insults to black students at the University of Missouri and the deaths of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
At the beginning of this year, Sanders was detained by Missouri police after his fuel ran out of the state and was detained for a crime and died under suspicious circumstances.
The recommendation also notes a new report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office, showing that there is a chance that black drivers in the province will be stopped 75 per cent more than whites.
"The advice statement is for people to be vigilant and to warn their families, friends and colleagues that they may be in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be ready to bring bail money with them, to inform their relatives about their passing through this state."
In Missouri, according to the latest figures in the FBI's hate crimes report program, 100 hate crimes were committed in 2015, which puts the state in the 16th place in the country in terms of the number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also a new response to a new Missouri law, where it is more difficult to sue a workplace to discriminate when renting or processing housing.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Association (ACLU) issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona after the migrant passed the laws of migrants, which ordered the local enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, and that ACLU said it would increase practices by race.
Travel warnings are usually published by the State Department for other countries, but recently the defense groups are resorting to this practice in response to a number of laws and trends within the United States.
Demba Ba in Beşiktaş OK
Demba Ba, who was transferred to Shanghai Shenhua for 13 million Euros 2 seasons ago and was rented to the Black and Whites during the half of the last season, returns to Beşiktaş free of charge.
Black Eagle, who asked the Senegalese player for a detailed health report last week, took action after a report from the star footballer.
The Black and White administration, which started working for the 32-year-old player that the Chinese representative did not think of in the squad next season, knocked on the door of the Shanghai team.
Not listed
Demba Ba, who was not listed due to being in foreign status in China, conveyed to the management that he wanted to return to the Black and Whites.
The Chinese team approved the departure of the 32-year-old player.
The Senegalese footballer is expected to come to Turkey in the coming days and sign an official contract.
Castillo was operated in Trabzonspor
Castillo had an arthroscopic meniscus operation from the left knee in Istanbul Liv Hospital, said in a statement on the website of the Bordeaux-blue club, "Prof. Dr. After the operation carried out by Uğur Haklar, our player is expected to start training with the team within 4 weeks."
Castillo was injured in a match against Dutch team Heerenveen at the Slovakia camp of the burgundy-blue team.
The Colombian player, who was announced to stay away from the field for 3-4 weeks due to his treatment, was also scheduled to operate due to his previous meniscus problem.
The referendum exit from Barzan!
Barzani delivered a speech at the commemoration ceremony in Duhok on the 3rd anniversary of the terrorist organization Daesh's attack on the Ezidi in the Sincar district of Mosul.
Referring to the independence referendum that the IKBY wanted to hold on September 25th, Barzani said: "I regret to say this, we have no hope that Iraq will be a right and proper country."
Iraq and I have tried all the roads, but we are completely helpless and desperate.
The past experiences with Iraq have put us in this state, and there is no guarantee that we can take our rights and protect us.
So in order to ensure coexistence and security, we all need to show the world that we can determine our destiny to the whole world through a referendum.
I also need to underline this; the referendum is not a purpose for us, but it is a tool for us to achieve a greater goal.
Reminding that the Iraqi central government made many promises to the Kurds after the destruction of the Baas Regime, Barzani said that the disaster in Sincar had occurred soon, and said that a direct referendum decision was taken after the fight against Daesh.
Barzani said he wants to self-defense peacefully and democratically for the protection and development of the IKBY people. "It has emerged with documents that Iraq cannot protect or protect us like a state."
"He doesn't want us to move forward," he defended his view.
Barzani reacted that during the fight against the terrorist organization ISIS, the Iraqi central government did not give them weapons, but that Hasdi Shabi, which was founded with a fatwa in a short period of time, was immediately legalized and all weapons were supplied, Barzani noted:
Within Iraq's defense system, Peshmerga was not taken.
The central government did not do what it offered to Hashdi Shabi to Peshmerge.
Peshmerga is considered part of Iraq's defence system, according to the constitution.
However, while Hashdi Shabi had no existence in the constitution, all means were violated and all the possibilities were mobilized.
We're not saying we're against Hashdi Shabi.
Peshmerga and Hasdi Shabi fought on the same front, so why Hashdi Shabi was legalized, while Peshmerga's presence and the fight against terrorism are covered up.
These are our deep wounds with Baghdad.
On 3 August 2014, Daesh attacked Ezidi living in Sincar, Mosul, killing many people, including women and children.
Returned from disaster with 10 minutes
According to a BBC report, the Boeing 777 airliner Air France was west of Hokkaido in northern Japan while North Korea's missile was in the air.
Officials noted that the missile crashed into the area where the plane was located 10 minutes ago, noting that the missile was estimated to be close to 100-150km on the plane.
Air France said that the missile did not intercede with the aircraft's course and that there was no problem with the flight.
"The information we have at this stage indicates that the missile fell into the sea more than 100 kilometers from the plane's course," the statement said.
Nothing is sacred?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty
The most precise sign of the regime exchange is that they start attacking the statues.
Americans know as much as anyone else, as well as the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, who was carefully staged, in 2003 at Firdos Square in Baghdad...
Stephen Miller, one of the key the Trump regime's key theorphalist, knew exactly what Jim Acosta from CNN and the president was doing when he symbolically destroyed the Statue of Liberty in a heated debate over the president's offer to severely restriction of legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue.
If he did, he'd have a lot of boat tours and the Freedom impersonator would have lynched him.
But he attacked his meaning, and especially in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed, the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to the monument base, and it was attributed to it.
As Miller went to Acosta, he said, "I don't want to talk about history from start to finish, but the Statue of Liberty... It is a ridiculous symbol of American freedom to the world.
The poem you mentioned was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller's really right, but as he says, it's not really about history.
This seems to be about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's terrifying words, not only a state in these, as it invites not only some elderly immigrants, but also the poor of the poor: "The tired, the poor, / The crowds of freedom are longing for their breath, / The wretched unwanted of the crowded land."
There has never been a time when "the engine unwanted" was so visible on our screens.
Miller did not bring a literary criticism, which he explained that these people were not welcome in the United States.
The conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it's actually a conflict about the meaning of America.
After Lazarus and his death, his friends, who campaigned to put his words on the base of the statue, knew very well that they had taken a very political act.
The statue intended to celebrate the links between French and American republicanism by representing the body of Freedom in the form of a woman.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in his poem the female figure was no longer abstract, he had a voice.
And he gives him a very different name: the Mother of the exiled.
The image of the poem is a genius feminist coup and a devastating attack on anti-American immigration.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wingers have long wanted to change it back.
Rush Limbaugh, a Baptist John-style for Trump's arrival, argued in 2010 that Freedom did not invite anyone in, but that it was an early era neocon that kept American fire in the dark world: "Mrs. Freedom stands out.
He exists to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
Not so the torch illuminates the path to the United States of America."
Unconventionally, Limbaugh actually discovered something.
The meaning of the statue was entirely about the angle of perception.
Lazarus's magnificent creative act was to see it as being seen by exhausted, wretched, but hopeful people on their decks after long and often terrible journeys.
It was really about seeing the world from the perspective of people who were looking for shelter and wanted to improve their lives.
His statue was retaliating to them with the words of hope and the warm welcome they needed.
Of course, this is not a perspective that Miller and Trump will find in any way justified.
Their torch is not to guide, but to make hate, which is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle remembers only two Scots when two Scots were able to make the British team
Neil Black, United Kingdom Athletics performance director, says the 16-member Scottish group in the World Championship squad will make a "conscious contribution to the team."
The record number Scottish athlete was selected for London 2017, which began on Friday.
Black believes that "something is developing" in Scotland and that UK athletics should learn from it.
"We adopt this, and we are trying to understand it, and we will work until we get through it," Black said.
"I'm talking to people at the Scotland Sports Institute, and they think it's about what they're doing.
Scottish Athletics thinks it's about what they did.
British athletics: he thinks it's about what they're doing.
So is the guy on the corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely great."
Many Scottish athletes compete for the medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competed against Sir Mo Farah at 5000 m, while Eilidh Doyle was selected as captain.
"Eilidh is a bit modest.
The captain's speech was unbelievable," says Black.
"No matter where they live or where they live or train, a few athletes are very proud and really motivated from that room.
The passion and true feeling that Eilidh naturally contributed was wonderful."
He will compete in the 400 m disability of the 4th World Championship, the silver medalist from the Commonwealth of Nations, says that 16 Scots were on the British team "unbelievable."
Scotland's highest total athlete in previous world championships was seven of the successes in 1983 and 2015.
Muir, the mid-distance runner who broke five Britain and two European records last year, is the leader.
He'll be attending 1500 m and 5000 m.
Chris O'Hare, who has had a very good season, including the attempts of the British Team and the victories at the Anniversary Games, is another Scotsman to watch at 1500 m.
Doyle remembers the first championship in which the other Scotsman on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that many of his compatriots will not only join the team, but in some cases he will compete for the medal and will compete for the finals, he is "very proud."
"The special thing about being a team captain was that it was with the votes given by the other members of the team, so it was already a great honor, but it made it extra special for me to know that your teammates voted for you and chose you," he added.
"Clearly, I'm proud of all the Scots who joined the team.
That's how far we're going.
And they're here as athletes who have proven themselves, as athletes who are looking to go on the podium.
As for the captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I took advantage of the fact that we're very lucky in this situation, so there's a World Championship in our house.
So, in reality, it's only the effect of benefiting from this infield support, and the fact that we're back to the Olympic Stadium.
I'm getting a second chance to get out there and fight, and there's going to be such a wonderful atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Candidate for state post if you can't handle voters' criticism
The father of our country had some information about being negative in the press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to start criticizing him heavily about everything from domestic politics to political principles.
Of course, he was annoyed by criticism.
But he didn't silence the critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be eliminated and we can be fooled and quietly to be slaughtered."
This brings me to Larry Hogan, the governor of Maryland, who has to work harder to be like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their ideas on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Association sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff did not care about the case on the grounds that it was untrue, and online comments were filled with "who cares about?" reactions.
Many people said, "This is just Facebook."
But it's important.
It's especially important when you're like Hogan.
It's a Republican governor who is astonishingly popular in a state that is overwhelmingly Democrat.
It has the second highest approval rate among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a reactionary flare.
He was a leader in the state and mastered strict commitment to principles.
He was also very resourceful to use Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his voters, with his prankless presentation of his hairless head after chemotherapy.
In other words, blocking the people who come to the page of the governor, which is an open public forum, which is officially described and controlled by the members of the public's tax dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's female spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than organizing them.
But it's easy to use images of trolls or spamists or hateful people attacking online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who talk to their chosen leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a priest; not troll.
They all said that their comments were not respectful, thoughtful and abusive.
In his sharing, the pastor quoted the Bible, addressing Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, lawyer from Maryland Bowie, was not hateful, but he asked about hate crimes.
"I made a comment that I was disappointed that he was disapproved of his unresponsiveness to hate crimes and other recent news," the post's commentary section wrote in the comment section of The Post.
"I also don't like the idea of being ignored as a collective effort rather than a large group of concerned citizens when many people comment on the same topic."
Others will probably call it "intentionalized spam attack" by the governor's staff as "concentrated spam attack."
The Facebook era makes it easy to make a message convenient through the prevention of an opponent or the deletion of a negative message.
It's much cleaner than the old days when the staff are sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles, or that the protesters are supposed to arrest and silence them.
But, even if it's digital, that's exactly what happened.
Hogan is not the first public mission to be criticized for disabling Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked in the Twitter stream.
One of the future decisions that could be referenced to this issue came from Virginia last week.
President of the Board of Auditors of the Loudoun Administrative District, U.S. Regional Judge James C in Alexandria. According to Cacheris, when he banned a voter on Facebook, he was violating the First Constitutional Amendment.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (Republican), Facebook and Twitter were also visited by ACLU.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington's time, the reasonable priced postal transfer had a very similar effect on the Internet.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and the unknown letter writers overcame his leadership.
Even then, Washington had unnamed trolls.
"Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" all people who used nicknames wrote letters to the newspapers that trampled Washington's decisions.
According to the online George Washington Articles Project, which collected historical documents, petitions with Britain overwhelmed the office criticizing his stance on the Friendship, Trade and Navigation Agreement.
But he didn't shut them up.
The freedom of expression, dissident and reproach is at the forefront of our nation.
And the real leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes he will be at the convenience of his home at Renaissance Club
Ronan Rafferty, the former number one in Europe, hopes that in the next three days, the Renaissance Club in the South Lothian will be at ease while hosting the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
At Archerfield Links, the Northern Irelander, who led the next door before losing to Paul Eales, feels committed to the new venue and acts as ambassador to the tournament on behalf of Jerry Sarvadi, the founder and CEO of the club.
"I watched the Renaissance Club be built, and we see that it has achieved glory with this organization," Rafferty said.
Players will see the field in its best form, in an exceptional situation.
Jerry did a marvelous job building this place.
He's an indistinguisher defender of this game, and he's proud of his success here.
This is a great show for the field."
Although the British Eales won both the Europen Tour and the European Challenge Tour, he will compete for the first time in his 32-year career to retain a championship.
"This feels really special," said the Southport-based player.
"I didn't get a chance to protect Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the calendar the day after the year I won.
It's so good to be back in this part of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
Memories come to life from last year, and it was very special to win for my wife, Sharon, last year.
It was a time of special and always lovingly commemorating."
At the beginning of this year, Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50, returns to the game on his home field.
This event will be the first Scotland competition since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"When you struggle inside, it always means a little more," said Helensburgh man Orr.
"You want to do well, but you also feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and played mainly golf.
I'm glad to go so far."
On the field, former Masters champions Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scottish on the field, while others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir, and Ross Drummond.

I found the answer
Imagine a "seat"... With 6 billion 867 million Turkish Liras, the budget is more than the budget allocated to each of the eleven ministries, including Economy, Development, Energy and Natural Resources, Science Industry and Technology, Environment and Urbanism, Health, Culture and Tourism Ministries!
The number of personnel is 117 thousand 378.
Turkey's largest "propaganda base!"
Yes, I'm talking about the Presidency of Religious Affairs!
Yes, I will talk about Mehmet Görz, the head of Religious Affairs!
For days... I'm looking for answers to my question...
I wonder why Mehmet Görz was taken out of his seat...
I've read every article about his submission.
I don't.
I can't seem to find the answer to my question.
Earlier this year...
Mehmet Görz has prepared the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan of the Presidency of Religious Affairs (DİB).
President Erdoğan withdrew the S 600 model Mercedes of 1 million pounds.
So he had no problem with Erdogan.
So what happened?
You can say, "Isn't it enough for seven years?"
First Head of DIB M. Rıfat Börekçi served for 17 years.
Mehmet Nuri Yılmaz, who you all know, sat in that seat for 11 years.
I mean, uh... The president's term is clear.
I return to my question: Why did Mehmet Görz leave his seat?
It's all over...
Shia closeness
The source close to the power said: - "According to the traditional ulema, Mehmet Dönmez did not claim the circumcision!"
The code for this sentence is that he did not claim the Sunniness!
The person who said this sentence bounced behind his back: "The traditional was found a modernist by ulema!"
I mean, Mehmet Görz was considered innovative.
What did it mean, innovation?
The answer to the question was hidden on Mehmet Görz's trip abroad.
Date: December 27, 2015.
Mehmet Görz went to Iran to attend the 29th Conference of Promise, which will be held in Tehran - aimed at bringing closer to Islamic sects.
He met with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the religious leader of Iran.
He prayed with his pagans, holding his ranks.
And at the conference, he said, "The sects are the human schools that represent different ideas and opinions in the understanding of Islamic religion."
Their purpose is to set forth the direction of Allah.
Each one of them is in a secondary road, but their arrival is the same.
It is unacceptable to make the sect religion in the same way or to see the sectarian a member over the Islamic belonging.
Separation based on sectation, marginalization and conflict are a reflection of taassub and ignorance.
In the event that sects prevent religion, the most damaged religion has been itself...
Here, I would like to emphasize again by underlining:
The Shiites and Sunnis are one nation...
"No one can disprove anyone else because he perceives Islam as he understands it"...
A year later...
Only Jafari leader Selahattin Özgündüz attended the 30th Vahdet Meeting from Turkey.
I mean, uh...
Vehhabiism is not Sunniness
Mehmet Görz's departure to Iran and his speech at the conference made him the target of "traditional product."
This was the fact that no one attended the next Tehran conference, representing the Turkish State - again.
Mehmet Görz had already received four invitations since he took office.
The reason was obvious: Shia in DİB - anti-Iran "traditional ulema!"
After the trip to Iran, Mehmet Görz's seat began to wear out as of the beginning of 2016.
The head of this was the leader of the DIB, the deputy prime minister Numan Kurtulmuş!
Mehmet Görz was so drowned that he wanted "the DIB to be attached to the Presidency."
At the core of the...
There was a difference in the view of Sunniism within the state.
Some of the "traditional ulema" created in the madrasas of Saudi Arabia and Egypt associated with Sunniness - in the shadow of the United States - Vehhabi-Selefiism!
These were anti-Iranians who had no tolerance for even the trip to Tehran.
The words of Cübbeli Ahmet about Mehmet Görz were not surprising: "Diyanet has not been dangerous.'
"Lord, let him be honored with the people and be true to the people of the people."
"Ehli circumcision" used as the symbol concept of Iranian hostility.
The anti-Iranism, which was made by FETÖ for a while, was now co-operating with new names.
And with the FETÖ plots...
The photo of a young man with a whiskey was served to the media with the lie "The son of Mehmet Görz!"
Oh, what a coincidence!
Who made Mehmet Görz the biggest opposition in the media: Turkey is the newspaper of the Isiklar Congregation in the US!
I mean...
- Resistance to bring Sunniship to the Saudi Vehhabi-Selefi line...
- Not fueling sectarian separation...
- Modernist... A clergyman was destroyed by the "traditional ulema" whose consciousness was created during the Cold War...
US cultural imperialism continues to rapidly Arabise Turkey (to make Vehhabi-Selefi).
Do not doubt that the future President of Religious Affairs will be the representative of the Vehhabi-Selester!
"We support Turkey's protection of sovereignty"
Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu went to China for an official visit.
Cavusoglu and Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi held a joint press conference at the State Guesthouse in Beijing, the capital.
"We hope that Turkey will participate more actively in international issues," Vang said.
China will support Turkey in efforts to maintain sovereignty, stability and security.
"We hope that it will be resolved with the international community, including Turkey, on the issue of Palestine," he said.
"Turkey is seeking close cooperation with regional and international organisations, and international organisations are not an alternative, but complementary," Çavuşoğlu said about the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.
Spiritual officially begins his second term
The presidency of Hasan Rohani, who won the presidential elections in Iran in May, was approved by the country's leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Hasan Rohani, who was elected president for the second time in Iran, took the oath at the ceremony, attended by the religious leader of the country, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Turkish Ambassador to Tehran Rıza Hakan Tekin participated in the ceremony, which was attended by senior military and political names, as well as representatives of foreign countries.
Ruhani, who will serve as president for another four years, will officially take office after the inauguration ceremony in parliament on Saturday (August 5th).
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci, representing Turkey, is expected to attend the ceremony.
Security measures at Cilvegözü Border Gate
The passage of trucks carrying materials other than humanitarian aid, food, medicine and cleaning agents will not be allowed from Cilvegözü Border Gate in Reyhanlı district of Hatay.
According to reports, the Cilvegözü Border Gate was closed to transplants other than humanitarian aid, food, medicine and cleaning agents due to adverse security conditions in the Babel Air Border Gate and its region near the Turkish border.
Help trucks are allowed to exit the Cilvegözü Border Gate.
No information was given as to how long the limitation would take.
Failure and Death in the Goldland of Indonesia
Bardina Degei doesn't use stoves when cooking.
He rarely even uses a pot.
The housewife puts a sweet potato directly on the fire, in the wooden house in Papua, the restless region of Indonesia, in Enarotali, in the regency of Paniai, usually locally known as "nota."
After half an hour, the roasted lump is removed and wiped out with appetite, the hands are not washed.
The degei sits on the muddy floor where he does chores, such as washing with turbid water from the nearby swamp, and he has no furniture.
It acts as a field latoon in a house without a roof.
He was not assigned to the youngest of her husband's four wives.
The polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed and many drink a lot, and there are soldiers.
"No one walks in the village after 5:00 p.m.."
A rare momentary view of daily life in the mountainous areas of Papua, an ancient Dutch colony absorbed by Indonesia in 1969, after a controversial referendum, where only 1026 elderly were forced to vote by force before the troops invaded.
An existing movement propagating independence against the Dutch administration has quickly directed its anger towards the Jakarta government, which has severe control over the region and bans foreign journalists or rights oversight organisations.
In 2003, the area was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, where independent Papua New Guinea would occupy the eastern part of the island.
As far as Enarotali is far away, the journey here includes a 90-minute flight from the regional capital Jayapura to Nabire and a 5-hour car-shared stomach-smoker ride.
No public transport.
The 19.000-seat town contains wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, crumched iron roofs have been transformed into various yellowish brown shades by rust.
Let the journalists, very few Indonesians traveled here and almost no foreigner traveled here.
Before the Christian missionaries arrived, the Mee Pago worshipped the Papulars, a god named Uga Tamee.
There's been some other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," he says, referring to his vivid colored, hand-touched turban, dark shirt and shiny skirt.
"We used to wear only leaves to our bodies first."
Papua is the poorest region in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and the worst child deaths in Asia and literacy rates.
But it's also Indonesia's golden land.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is only 60 miles away from Paniai, a mountainous area of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
Only in 2015, Freeport extracted about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion timber reserves.
However, these wealth, which is a source of misery for the Papews, allow the strong army of Indonesia to maintain a suffocating presence.
The New York Times' 2005 study reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 to a single officer.
More otonomials' call for more autonomy threatens this golden egging chicken, and it comes from their ruthless rights.
According to the defenders of the right, more than 500,000 Papuli have been killed by the Indonesian army since 1969, and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
Mass murders in the 1970s in the mountainous parts of Papua reached genocide figures, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators in the region alone last year.
The Brisbane Archdiocese's 2016 report "We Will Lose Everything" contains the testimony of the apocalyptic, such as illegal executions, torture (according to another report, rape and electricity execution, and brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations).
"It's hard to calculate the number of victims because there are events every week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Pressures have been increased as Papua's sources bring settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million is 83% Christian, but the population of Indonesia's crowded islands, Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi, has changed demographics as Muslim immigrants come for economic purposes.
Javan warung buffets sell bedo-gadoes served with peanut sauce mixed with fried chicken and vegetables.
The locals are struggling to compete.
"Immigrants sell chickens and vegetables cheaper in traditional markets than local Papide," explains Abeth You, 24-year-old indigenous Paniai, who moved to regional capital Jayapura for business.
"This caused the native Papuas to lose the market of the Papular food-mamas (women)."
Indonesian president Joko Widodo, more known as Jokowi, pledged to resolve inequalities and rights violations in Papua during the 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter took the vote of 27 out of 29 districts of Papua, including Panaia, as he proceeded on the road to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But very little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014, we voted for Jokowi in the hope that justice will be restored," he says.
In fact, Paniai experienced its worst condition only two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children outsided Enarotali singing Christmas songs in front of a bonfire, while two Indonesian soldiers broke through the dark on the motorcycle.
The scared boys told them they had to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers resented their style, and according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, he returned with four soldiers.
Victims and eyewitnesses said that soldiers who had been drinking were chasing the group and beat the band with their rifles with their butts.
Then one of the soldiers fired at the group of children.
Yulianus Yeimo, one of the children, was beaten so badly that he was in a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government election commission building was set on fire, and the next day, the events escalated.
Up to 1,000 Papuali men, women and children gathered to demand justice on a football field in front of the local police station and a military command center.
They were carrying ceremonial advances, and they danced the waita dance of Papua's Mee Pago tribe (while running in the shape of a neighborhood and imitating the bird singing).
Some protesters started throwing stones at the police and the military garrison.
As the nerves were getting any more tense, the soldiers were sent orders by internal radio: "If the crowd shows more than three times resistance, shoot them to death." That's what the official document seen by TIME, which was not disclosed to the local media, was saying.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood in Enarotali, saw the upcoming danger and demanded calmness by burning to the crowd to return home.
No one had any intention of listening.
"When I suddenly returned, I was shot by my left wrist," he told TIME in the porch of the painted wooden house in bright colors.
The skiing still doesn't know who's shooting, but he says the bullet came from the collected military erat
"It was a crowd, shots many times," he adds.
According to his cousin, who witnessed the attacks, the native Alfius Youw was shot three times.
Like many Indonesians, Yohanes, who is known only by his only name, told TIME pessimistic, "I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him."
"I saw you die... I kissed him."
Inspector General Yotje Mende, the chief of Papua, told reporters that his officers only "safe" the police station were under attack because he was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Pudjo Sulistiyo, spokesman for Papua police, in 2015.
"This is a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news of the deaths reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, in Jayapura, he gave an enthusiastic speech in Jayapura, stating that he shared the pain of the victims' families and promised to resolve historical abuses in Papua.
"I want this case solved immediately so that it doesn't happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said he had established an unbiased mechanism for historical human rights violations.
But the excuses almost started.
"Many of the violations happened a long time ago.
Some are in the '90s, and some in the early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these violations, but we have processes to go through," he said.
Speaking to TIME on June 5th, Wiranto backed down, saying he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "They will all be solved by the law."
The U.N. accused East Timor of "crimes against humanity" related to more than 1,000 deaths during the bloody independence vote in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai incident, have already been resolved.
The families of the Paniai victims welcomed such claims with bitter skepticism.
"I've been interviewed four times in the past three years, but there's been no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he's still living in fear after years.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the soldier, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus reiterates the opinion that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by a soldier after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After he buried the bodies, the soldier came looking for me."
The attacks haven't stopped yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at the villagers, Paniai's neighbour Deiyai.
During the clash between the villagers and a construction company that refused to help take a man of his own to the hospital, one person was killed and 17 others, including the children, were injured.
Ravianus Douw, a 24-year-old drowned in a nearby lake while fishing, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's construction site.
The police said the villagers threw stones at the officers, and they reacted by a warning shot.
But the indigenous people say that the moving brigade (Indonesial paramilitary police) has opened fire on the crowd and killed someone.
"We were very panicked, we were afraid we would be taken revenge," told 29-year-old Dominggu Badii TIME, who lived near the hospital and witnessed the training of the wounded.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament called for the officers involved in this business to be held accountable and to withdraw the moving police brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a problematic area for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the peoples of the tribes of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live scattered throughout Papua's green mountain center.
Many of them joined the Revolting Army Free Papua Movement (OPM), which claimed to protect the rights of the Papular by random attacks and raiding Indonesian soldiers.
Some senior OPM leaders, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya, come from Paniai.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and arbitrarily held by soldiers under the guise of "protecting national sovereignty."
Some of them are never visible again.
Among the Papua peoples, Paniai is known as "a tragic and forgotten place."
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
A little rice on sale in Enarotali is very expensive for locals to buy.
The bread is unattainable.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly notes, as well as some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women who can sustain four or five field sweet potatoes.
They usually store most of the harvest for the family, sell the rest in the local market.
10 notes only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between new migrants arriving in large numbers since the opening of new air routes to the native Papuas and Nabire Airport.
Things that are already fewer often go to migrants who are better educated and richer.
The capitals or the necessary qualifications are very rarely in order to carry out the work of the Papuas as competitive.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there is no work or money here," says John Gobai, president of the Panai tribal council.
The isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.
Furthermore, the restrictions on journalism for the international media remain tight.
At the beginning of this year, French journalist Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua due to "deficiency of coordination with related institutions", despite the permission to make a rare video for them.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign has not lifted and improved news restrictions to increase transparency.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Papua and West Papua, the restless eastern tip of Indonesia: visa rejection and blacklisted."
The lack of press supervision means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is mostly limited to neighbours near Papua.
In March, six Pacific nations (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands) B.M. He encouraged the Human Rights Council to investigate "diversive and widespread violations" in Papua, including Panaia attacks.
The same countries historically support the OPM.
"The democratic system in Indonesia is still valid and free media, so it is difficult to cover up evidence in human rights cases," Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir told reporters in Jakarta.
The locals want more foreign governments to take care of it.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands visited Jayapura on May 4th, headed by the country's human rights envoy, Kees Van Baar, locals broke their silence with the "We want freedom" begs, according to a source that attended the meeting and did not want his name to be announced.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuas say it is unlikely that they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is translated by people involved in the Paniai attack," says the head of the tribal council, Gobai.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people are rolling through small education and health care and fascism, except to live under the upcoming threat of the tyrant soldier.
Like the other Papuas, the Paniai people see their own votes as a "debt" to repay Jokowi.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidations, the families of the victims of the Paniai attack carried out a final symbolic counterattack: burying a victim's body in the area opposite the police and the military station.
Knowing that justice may never be carried out, at least they will ensure that the responsible ones do not forget their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus, with his head tilted.
"What else can we do?"
Fire surrounds Dubai's ' Torch' skyscraper for the second time
On Friday in Dubai, a fire swept the world's tallest residential towers, and hundreds of residents forced hundreds of residents to escape the 79-story building, 337 meters long.
This is the second largest fire that spread rapidly to the tall building called Torch tower in two years.
The building was evacuated, no reports of any injuries, and no explanation was made about the cause of the big fire.
"We were sleeping, and we woke up to the fire alarm, people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50th floor." That's how a resident named George spoke to Reuters.
Dubai's civil defense authorities said the fire brigade put out the fire brigade around 4 (00:00 GMT) in the morning at local time and were refrigerating the building.
The government has said they are trying to provide shelter for those affected.
This can resurface questions about the safety of the material used in the outer parts of high-rise buildings around the world.
The torch administration's investigation after the fire in 2015 found that most of the damage was in the exterior panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believed that the insulation and coating panel system on the Grenfell Tower of London, where 80 people died, may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire there in June.
"Social assistance" for more than 4,000 chronic patients
The Ministry of Family and Social Policies will benefit 4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients from the first stage.
The Ministry, which plans to provide patients with monthly support over two-thirds of the minimum wage through the aid programme, will also provide regular psychosocial support.
According to the information obtained, the details and implementation principles of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Fighting Chronic Diseases," which started to work with the instructions of Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, Minister of Family and Social Policies, have been determined.
The social assistance programme, which was launched in cooperation with the Ministry of Health to support citizens who are struggling with chronic diseases and have economic and psychological difficulties, is a first in the world in many aspects.
Having completed all the preparations for the launch of the programme, the Ministry will provide families with regular psychosocial support, not only cash but also for regular psychosocial support with the outreach programme.
In this way, it is aimed that poor citizens and their families who have chronic diseases and continue their treatment processes in their homes should not be left alone both materially and spiritually.
According to studies, in the first stage, poor citizens struggling with Subakut Sclerozan Panencefalitis (SSPE), a brain disease caused by tuberculosis disease and measles microbes, will be supported regularly within the scope of the new outreach programme.
In the following phases of the programme, the aid programme for poor citizens struggling with other rare and risky diseases will be included.
In addition to the support planned to be given at a rate of over two-thirds of the minimum wage, additional payments can be made to tuberculosis patients who are determined by the relevant health unit to improve their home living conditions, which cannot be removed medical self-care, who are bed-dependent, or that they are determined by the relevant health unit.
In order to benefit from the support, the minimum monthly income per capita is required to be less than two-thirds of the net monthly amount of the minimum wage.
In addition, citizens with SSPE should have a health board report issued according to the procedures and principles specified in the "Regulation on the Measure of Praise, Classification and Health Board Reports to be given to the Disabled."
According to the survey, more than 1 out of 5 US passengers bring prohibited substances to the plane
According to a survey conducted with airline passengers, more than 20 per cent intentionally or unknowingly hijacked prohibited substances from the U.S. Transportation Security Agency checkpoints, including at least 6 percent carrying a forbidden knife or other sharp objects without knowing.
Less than one percent later claimed that he noticed that he accidentally traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The research conducted by the jet charter service called Stratos Jet Charters found that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Among the participants who admit that they are deliberately trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent are Y generation members, but few than 15 members of generation X.
The most commonly deliberately smuggled from TSA agents is food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent of them knowingly admitted sharp tools from security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted that they were deliberately carrying prohibited drugs.
The company said that how many people from airport security accidentally brought smuggled goods and conducted a survey of passengers across the country to find out how many did it on purpose.
It is no surprise that the most likely people to spend illegal goods in deliberately or unknowingly are the most flying ones.
Still, as the company points out, the TSA rules are a bit complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure about which liquids or how much they can carry from them.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of substance confiscated by the TSA appears as prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought TSA might be treating books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but international ones are not allowed.
China welcomes US statements
"We are not seeking an excuse for regime change, the regime collapse, the panma of the peninsula, and sending our troops to the north of the 38th parallel," Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi said at a press conference in Beijing, the capital, referring to the Pyongyang administration.
Chinese Foreign Minister Vang said Tillerson reiterated the principles of the Washington administration's principles for the North Korean issue and hoped that the United States would implement these principles effectively and in a concrete result-oriented policy.
Noting that the security of the Korean peninsula is its priorities, Vang stressed that the parties expect them to find a middle way that they can resolve their concerns through equal dialogue, and that the Beijing administration has insisted on the nuclear purification of the peninsula, the protection of peace and stability, and the resolution of problems through dialogue and negotiation.
EPA President Pruitt Retires Obama-era Emission Reducing Laws
A day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, president of the Environmental Protection Organization, withdrew his decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era laws, which had previously reduced air pollutants emissions that caused the dirty smoke.
Pruitt represented the change, with his own organization being more susceptible to the needs of state environmental regulators than the governments.
He never mentioned any legal appeals against his previous position in a federal supreme court.
The state's ground level is that they start meeting October 1st, the deadline for the ground level ozone 2015 standards.
Pruitt announced that he would delay coliance in June for a year in June to give his organisation more time to work on the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or preventing economic growth."
Before his appointment by President Donald Trump, Pruitt, Oklahoma's state attorney, served as a reliable ally against tighter landscaping for a long time.
Since Pruitt arrived in Washington, he has repeatedly taken action to prevent or delay regulations against the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change is Pruitt's latest legal defeat for the agenda of retrieval of the regulation.
Last month, a federal suat in Washington ruled that the EPA executive attempted to delay the practice demanding that oil and gas companies, a Obama administration law, oversee and reduce methane leaks, would exceed the limits of its authority.
The return in ozone standards strengthens EPA's commitment to meet only new standards with states and work through complex processes, a statement released Wednesday evening, said in a statement released Wednesday evening.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA would often fail to meet the deadlines of the decisions, wait to be sued by activist groups and others, and agreed to resolve the dispute to set the timing for the decision," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous business.
"We do not believe in regulating by suing, and we take the deadline dates seriously.
We also take the law seriously and the authority it has given us."
Nevertheless, the EPA's statement said Pruitt could once again use "the power to seize and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the regulations are "supported by solid policies and with the best available information".
Republicans in Congress are pressing for a wider rewriting of ozone laws.
A Parliamentary bill, approved last month, is striving to delay the implementation of the laws of 2015 by at least eight years.
The preliminary process has not yet been brought to the Senate for a vote.
New York chief prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, who led the state coalition that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA's change of decision after our cases is an important achievement for the health and safety of more than 115 million Americans, who are directly affected by the dirty smoke flowing to 6.7 million New Yorkers and their communities," Schneiderman said.
The case was attended by New York from California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and District of Columbia.
When general pollutants are released by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources reacting to sunlight in the atmosphere, the ground level is generated.
The resulting smoke can cause serious breathing problems in a group of people who are quickly affected and contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year.
Public health defenders and environmentalists applauded Pruitt's surprise change of decision.
Lori Ann Burd of the Biological Diversity Center said: "It is disturbing that the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe requires so much pressure to take this common sense step."
"We must continue to fight against the ideological struggle of the Trump administration to pollute the environment and to be slanderous to the groups of interests."
Inflation single digit
Turkey, which achieved the biggest increase in exports in July, attracted unemployment from 13 per cent in January to 10.5 in April, and the economic confidence index rose to the peak of 3.5 years, and reduced inflation to a single household.
According to the data announced yesterday by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK), the Consumer Price Index (TUFE) rose by 0.15 percent in July, while annual inflation fell to one household for the first time since January with 9.79 percent.
As for the main expenditure groups, the highest monthly increase was in the restaurant and hotels group with 1.75 per cent, while the group with the highest decline was clothing and shoes at 3.51 per cent.
The highest annual increase was 15.24 per cent in the transport group.
"In the moderate course in inflation in inflation in inflation, in line with expectations, the decrease in food and clothing groups prices has an impact."
But in the core indicators, unlike the headline, there is a rise compared to the previous month.
"We don't expect a loosening in the firm stance of the Central Bank," he said.
Despite the decline in inflation, the headline has risen in nucleus inflation indicators.
The B index, which is closely monitored by the Central Bank, has increased from 9.07 per cent to 9.46 per cent in July, from 9.20 per cent to 9.60 per cent.
Enver Erkan, Deputy Director of Research in Capital FX, stated that inflation can be closed from 9.3 percent. "Inflation can fluctuate until December and fall to a single household in December."
"The Central Bank may have an opportunity by the first months of 2018," he said.
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek: Inflation will close the end of the year with a single household.
The Central Bank's tightening will continue until inflation drops below 7 per cent.
We will give the final shape to reforms at the nearby Food Committee.
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci: We are glad that inflation has fallen to a single digit, but it must become permanent.
In the fight against inflation, food prices should be lowered, as well as increased supply.
Development Minister Lütfi Elvan: Due to the base effect in the coming months, some upward trends in annual inflation may occur, but the decline in inflation will be evident from the first months of 2018.
We're guessing that annual inflation will go even further down.
I wish Fenerbahçe success in their next match.
Sturm Graz Manager Franco Foda, UEFA Europa League 3. In the first round of the preliminary qualifying round, he said that his performances in the second half were not enough to jump the round in the 1-1 draw with Fenerbahçe.
Speaking at a press conference after the match, Foda stated that Fenerbahçe was a high-level team and said, "We were unable to use the wings in the first half."
In the second half, we balanced the game.
We had a chance for the second goal.
I'm still proud of my team.
In the second half, they changed the course of the game.
We could've been a little better.
Little things were decisive in the game.
"I wish Fenerbahçe success in their next match." he spoke.
As long as they are in Turkey, they feel very good and are happy because of the hospitality they have seen.
Fernando in Istanbul
Brazilian footballer Fernando Francisco Reges, where Galatasaray Club started transfer negotiations, came to Istanbul.
The Brazilian footballer, who came to Atatürk Airport, welcomed the fans with enthusiasm.
Fernando, where yellow-red fans cheered with cheers, took the special vehicle waiting for him under security measures and left the airport.
Fernando, 30, started his career with Brazil's Vila Nova and played for Estrela Amadora, Porto and Manchester City.
The Brazilian footballer is expected to sign a contract with the yellow-red team after undergoing a medical checkup.
Galatasaray, which continued its transfer work, signed a deal with Manchester City for €5 million for Fernando, which he has been trying to recruit for a long time.
Flash Rakka move from USA: Homeland Security Force...
Colonel Dillon, who was connected to the U.S. Department of Defense (Pentagon) with the video conference management from Baghdad, stated that the Rakka Homeland Security Force (RIGG), trained by the coalition, has begun to settle in areas cleared of Daesh in the city.
"The Raqqa Homeland Security Force, mostly composed of Arabs and local volunteers against Daesh in the cleared areas of the city, continues to maintain order and prevent terrorists from escaping or return," Dillon said.
Dillon stated that 230 more people completed their education this week and joined the group, adding that "the number of forces in question is 850 for now."
The coalition has been trained by the group on basic weapons training, as well as first aid, armed conflict, screening and checkpoint operations, he said.
Dillon said the coalition would continue to screen applicants for education and employment.
The US-led coalition is cooperating with the Syrian Democratic Forces, which the PYD/PKK is the main backbone of the PYD/PKK in the acquisition of Raqqa.
The PYD/PKK terrorist organization appointed Leyla Muhammed, a PKK terrorist co-chaired by the Raqqa civil government council.
It is alleged that PKK/PYD members will be part of the military force in Raqqa.
Dillon also announced that the US-led coalition has collected heavy weapons from the opposition group Shuheda Karyateyn (Shakhuk) at the camp of Al-Tasph in southern Syria, where the US-led coalition discontinued last week.
"After meeting with their leaders last week, Shuhuk brought back the heavy weapons and equipment the coalition had given them, but some small weapons and light vehicles were allowed to stay in them," Dillon said.
Last week, the United States announced that it had withdrawn its support from Shuhuk on the grounds that it had gone outside the non-conflict zones they agreed on with Russia and patrolled and were involved in activities that were not related to the fight against Daesh.
It is said that the group wants to fight against Daesh as well as the Bashar al-Assad regime.
According to leaked phone call notes, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall.
Notes of the phone calls between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia were leaked by the Washington Post.
On 27 January, during a telephone conversation with Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump pressed that he would not publicly say that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The president of the United States scolded the president of Mexico, who held the wall openly to the ball, and rumoured that he said, "You can't tell the press about this."
Trump launched his presidential campaign on building a wall along the US southern border and promised Mexico that it would pay the project.
Notes of his first meeting with Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who had unleashed heated dialogue, were also published.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that the agreement on the acquisition of refugees from the United States to Australia was "massism," "distributed" and "stupid," and that after offering a ban on refugee resettlement to the United States, the Obama-led agreement would make itself look like a "budala."
Mr. Trump ended the speech to Mr. Turnbull, saying, "This was the most unpleasant speech I've had all day."
Patient relatives broke the doctor's nose
Turkish High Specialization Training and Research Hospital doctors and employees left a short-term job yesterday morning in response to the beating of a doctor's friends by their relatives.
The crowd gathered in front of the hospital's main entrance with foreign exchanges written "No violence in health" they carried in their hands, reacted to the incident.
Pediatric Cardiology Clinical Chief Prof. Dr. Feyza Ayşenur Paç, the slogan "No violence in health" sounds like an inadequate and even side slogan."
In health, there's no place for violence.
"If it goes like this, these people will soon find a health group that will serve themselves," he said.
Ankara Provincial Health Manager Dr. Kamil Türkmen, Secretary General of Ankara First District Public Hospitals Prof. Dr. Öner Odabaş, Turkey High Specialization Training and Research Hospital Chief Physician Prof. Dr. Mustafa Paç and the patient relatives in the hospital garden also supported.
Condemning the incident, Paj said:
Unfortunately, violence against health workers is increasing.
We have relived an example of this event yesterday (the previous day) with the beating of our cardiovascular surgeon by a patient's relative.
In order for these events to end as soon as we have taken as our state, ministry and governorship, we demand that our people's sensitivity to this issue increase.
I condemn yesterday's events on behalf of my hospital and my paramedics.
Odabaş pointed out that society should be aware of violence in health, "Unfortunately, this time has become a professional complication that we have experienced."
"We will take our own precautions, but most importantly, our nation will take care of its own health worker," he said.
"Our laws on violence in health have emerged sufficiently."
The government's ranks are practicing.
The safety's working right now.
In the past, all this has always been idle, but now it's a direct public case, and the state is appointing a lawyer, following up the case.
"There are also severe criminals taken about this," he said.
After the announcements, the employees continued their work.
The incident allegedly took place around 5:45 a.m. the other day.
The relatives of the patient who died in intensive care, Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr Hamdi Mehmet attacked Uzbek.
While Uzbek was being expelled from the scene by doctors and assistants, police were called to the hospital.
While Uzbek's nose was broken, the attackers were detained.
A doctor from the witnesses said:
When our friend went to his relatives to inform the condition of a patient who lost his life, the patient's relatives held our friend and us responsible and attacked two of our friends.
Our friend's nose is broken, covered in blood.
Then we took our friend into the O.R. and hid it.
He's got security set for 15-20 minutes.
If the patient's relatives had crossed that firewall, something worse would have happened.

The looting of YPGs in Syria...
USA intervenes
According to local sources, the AA's local sources reported that the YPG terrorists looted the homes of the village of Tel Semin, in the northern countryside of Raqqa, where he entered the US military support on the grounds of fighting the terrorist organization Daesh.
The reaction of civilians whose homes were looted and confiscated turned into conflicts with the terrorist organization.
As a result, U.S. forces entered the town in armored vehicles.
Armored armourers, personnel carrier vehicles and Husky-type mine detection vehicles were seen to form a buffer zone in the town.
The terrorist organisation YPG does not allow civilians fleeing deaths to enter the cities under their control in Raqqa, which was under fire as part of the anti-ISIS operation.
The local network of activists, "Rakka is being quietly slaughtered," announced yesterday that only in July, 121 civilians were killed in the organization's artillery fire.
Let's not carry the fights of the old world to tomorrow
Late perception of the dormitory and world realities can lead to crises, not plain people, but also countries.
One of the reasons why the backward East, which we call "songness," perceived by delaying the world's realities, may be the prevention of the reflection of these facts on the geographies of the East by certain focuses or the fact that it is declared beyond reality.
Don Quixote and Oblomov have been the subject of the literary world to perceive or perceive facts and change by delaying or not to perceive it at all.
Cervantes' "Don Quixote" is a madman who still thinks he is a knight when the bourgeoisie begins to form.
Or Gonchael's "Oblomov" was a lazy legacy that thought that when he ignores the truth, everything can go back the way it used to.
The Chinese example, for example, was a country open to the world until the end of the 15th century, and it was closed as a result of a conservative dynasty's crown.
This has lasted until the execution of the captains of the boats that went beyond the Chinese land waters.
One foot, eye and ear in the West, the other foot, eyes and ears in the East, we Turks, we have experienced constant dilemmas of perception of facts and change starting from the Ottoman Empire.
We tried to move yesterday to this day, to understand today with the concepts that fit the old conditions, to think of yesterday tomorrow.
One of our parts was that we were able to act as quickly as the focus of thought in developed countries in order to perceive the realms of dorms and worlds and change.
This has been a source of constant conflict, tensions.
The university with Madrasah, the modern army with the Janissary, the encounter of doubt with faith, caused a dramatic dusk.
Progress is also old and worse, it was not accepted that new and advanced postures at a time would get old and will be left behind at the end of certain periods.
After a while, the progressives of yesterday began to declare "Dangerous" and "Truth" who tried to interpret the new and advanced conditions in harmony with the current reality.
The most important lesson is that those who perceived the realities of the dormitory and the world in the Ottoman Empire by delaying the domination of the world, the empire was disbanded, collapsed and the people became poor.
The most important lesson of our Ottoman past was the fact that the rapid perception of the world conjuncture and change was an inevitable prerequisite for survival.
Since this course is very well absorbed, we have been able to be the exemplary country of this geography, which has been able to maintain its unity, integrity and stability peacefully from World War I to the next day.
A different approach In order to get through the global change process that has been entered in order to survive and safely, we need to leave the memorization behind and act in harmony with the facts.
In other words, no good will come to anyone from carrying the meaningless camping and blood feuds that have caused our democracy to limp in the past.
Moreover, the smallest mistakes in today's world lead to huge and dramatic crises.
The most problematic geography in this regard is the Middle East, which we are in.

Turkey's wind
The global giants, who trust in Turkey's future, fought against the breaker in the wind farm tender that took place yesterday.
The world record was broken in the tender made by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources with the model designed to ensure the transition to national energy by reducing foreign dependence.
The tender, which will reduce Turkey's energy costs, opened the way for $1 billion in investment and nearly 4,000 jobs.
Domestic production wind turbines will be included in the system by the beginning of 2019.
8 consortiums, including US, Chinese, German and Danish giants participated in the renewable resource areas (YEKA) wind plant license tender opened by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.
The tender opened financial bid envelopes to determine the top 5 bidders.
After the initial bid envelopes, the lowest bid was $4.19/kilovatsaat.
The open diminishing range was set at 0.01 cents.
After the tender began, Enercon decided not to participate in the deficit reduction of joint venture groups, including Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas.
In the open reduction, Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang competed.
Following the withdrawal of Nordex's consortium, MingYang-First Construction and Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon were left in the last two.
MingYang-First Construction has taken a break 11 times.
Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon Energy consortium has never taken a break.
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak: Record day for Turkey.
The open reduction continued 30 laps.
The winner of the intense competition between the two consortiums was the Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon joint venture group, which offered the lowest bid with 3.48 dollars/kgvat hour.
The consortium offered a 3.49-dollar/kilovat hourly bid in the tender, while the bid was withdrawn to 3.48 with the request of the tender commission headed by Deputy Undersecretary Alparslan Bayraktar.
With the result of the two-hour YEKA tender, Turkey has achieved a world record.
The bid for $3.48/cent per kilowatt hour has been the lowest number in the world's area.
The previous record was in Mexico's hands with $3.84/cent per kilowatt hour.
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak, who held a press conference after the end of the tender, stated that winning the competition by the German company Siemens was an important message to the region and the world. "When we look at Turkey and Germany's 200-year historical cooperation, I think this result will make an important contribution to Turkey-German relations."
Our targets are great.
The result today has demonstrated how robust and confident the economy and energy market is taking steps towards the future.
No matter how regional crises there are in the world, I was proud to present with this tender that Turkey is one of the most reliable investable countries in the region and the world.
"All of Turkey, 80 million in this picture, the biggest contribution is our President, who has brought Turkey to this point within its 15 years of power and leadership."
Mr. Albayrak stated that they started a new era with the tender, which is open, transparent and comparative competition, and said: "One of the most important steps of this was realized with a global record price by falling to 3.48 dollars/cent with a domestic contribution share in the wind until yesterday, with a historical record."
I'm proud of it, for my nation, for my country.
Minister Albayrak stated that they aim to commission the first domestic production panels in solar energy before the end of 2018 and said, "I hope that we will include our domestic production wind turbines in the system by the beginning of 2019."
Turbines will be established in 5 designated zones.
The winner of the competition will put a total of 1,000 megawatts of installed power in each of these 5 regions with the condition of establishing a wind power of at least 50 megawatts.
The total investment of the Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon group will be over $1 billion.
With the introduction of domestic wind power plants, a minimum of 3 billion kilowatt hours of electrical energy will be produced each year, and the annual electricity needs of about 1.1 million houses will be met from the wind.
Thanks to the wind facilities to be installed, an average of 1.5 million tons of CO2/year emission reduction will be achieved.
The winner of the competition will build a factory with more than $100 million investment.
The factory will produce between 300 and 450 domestic wind turbines with a minimum capacity of 2.3 megawatts.
Consortium will do R&D work in at least 3 of the specifications, wing, generator design, material technologies and manufacturing techniques, software and innovative gearbox fields for 10 years in total.
The budget of $5 million is allocated for R&D work, while 50 technical personnel, 80 percent of which are domestic engineers, will work.
The factory will be established 21 months after the contract is signed.
The license period of the project is 30 years.
Kazım Türker, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Türkerler İnşaat, who took part in the consortium that won the tender, stated that domestic production will be around 64 percent in the project and 35 percent equipment will come from abroad and said, "We plan to provide the financing of the equipment from foreign sources and the rest from domestic banks."
Türker said the tender reflects confidence in the Turkish economy.
Kalyon Holding Energy Group President Murtaza Ata said, "It was a tender that would reduce Turkey's dependence on foreign by a thousand megawatts."
"We're happy with the result," he said.
Hakan Yıldırım, Senior Manager of SIemens Gamesa Turkey, stated that they have been operating in Turkey for 160 years and said, "We will do our best to reduce the electricity unit cost."
The domesticity rate of the wind turbines to be produced in the factory will be at least 65 percent.
Of the 8,000 industrial parts in the wind turbine, 65 percent will be domestic (at least 5,200 pieces).
In each of the 5 regions, at least 50 MW and a total of 1000 MW of facilities will be installed.
Employment of 3,750 people 10 years R&D requirement 5 million dollars money to be allocated to R&D activities every year
1.000MW Wind Plant 65% Domestic Rate 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines with a minimum capacity of 2.3 MWe.
Investment over $1 billion in factory investment over $400 MW/year year-round power generation capacity over $100 million.
Electricity generation to meet the needs of approximately 1.1 million houses Minimum 3 billion kWh of electricity generation Every year Average 1.5 million tons of CO2/year emission reduction.
Moore's Ford massacre: Activists Revitalize the Racist lynching Event for Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury was passed through a group of viewers in the Monroe Georgia countryside, and the jingle was moved towards the little Ford Bridge in Moore.
The car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, stood out to block the road by a group of armed white men before reaching the bridge.
The leader of the gang, a man in a middle-aged striped suit, took a long breath from the cigar and carefully looked through the windshield.
Inside, the residents were scared.
"We want that z.., Roger!" he barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
As a young black man drifted out of the front passenger seat, the screams pierce the darkness.
Fortunately, this horrific scene on June 22nd is just a reenactment.
But when a noose was thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost everyone from the audience breathed quite realistically.
Since 2005, human rights defenders have returned to the Ford bridge in Moore to revive the lynching of two black couples (Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey) by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
So far, no one has ever been charged with murders.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the revitalization, said: "While we see them in our communities, we know who they are, it is unthinkable that not a single person has been arrested for all these years."
"This is a stain on date, but a burden on our souls."
Brooks 71 years old, he was a former Georgian congressman and a lifelong human rights defender.
For him, this revitalization is a call for a dramatic act, and a yearly reminder to Monroe society, where injustice has never been corrected.
He said, "We want prosecution, we want results, we want wounds to be healed, we want reconciliation, but we have to achieve justice first."
"We can't have the wounds until they get justice."
On July 27, 1946, the coroner put a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Ford linci in Moore.
According to the FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding areas were suspects in lynching.
But not one of them has ever been investigated.
Although suspects have been fugitives for decades, human rights defenders say that the twin motivations of lynchings are always well known all over the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a supreme court ruled that black citizens in Georgia voted for the first time in the primary election at the end of that summer.
According to the FBI, almost at the same time as the election, black partner Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, apparently stabs Barnett Hester in connection with a woman.
Brooks stated that the rumor in the town was that Hester slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy, and that the baby he was carrying was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a leading white landowner, paid $600 to get Malcom out of jail.
Dorothy and her cousins went to prison with Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they drove away from prison, when they came to the Ford Bridge in Moore, a lynch gang surrounded the car.
An FBI report concludes, "It seems that it was Harrison who arranged the murders and ordered the order."
"There was also a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement, which was not only involved in the murder, destroyed evidence and concealed the identity of eyewitnesses."
Brooks was shorter and more self-conscious.
He said, "This was a slaughter of the right to vote."
"They were all killed to send a message to the black people in this community: 'If you register and vote, that's what will happen to you.'"
For almost ten years, Cassandra Greene has been reenacting the lynchings of the Ford Bridge lynchings in Moore, which takes place every year.
It reveals all the details of its performance, which is remarkable, and it is based on a deep kind of racism that many believe there is no longer in America.
It's hard to watch, and it's even harder to turn your look, but Greene says it's the point.
He said, "We don't want to talk about lynch because it's all of us face the ugliness of our hearts."
"But if you're not listening to me or listening to what happened to me, I can't develop a relationship with you."
The rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, they filled a room with nearly 30 actors (one dozen whites and the rest black), and when Greene attempted to enter the well-reheared general lines of the game, they listened.
Wade Marbaugh is the co-director of Greene.
Over the years, he's played the role of President Klansman, but he says the role has never been easier.
Marbaugh said, "I feel dirty because it's not me."
"But I think it's very important to keep this past alive because we don't want to go back to that time."
During the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, were rehearsing their lines.
The game begins when Malcom screams at Hester, who is so angry about sleeping with his wife Dorothy, and pushes him.
"Z....i, get off my property!"
Rascona's reacting.
There's a bang.
And then everyone (at least black actors) burst into laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
Rascona said, "What?"
He was alarmed, surprised.
Was I too hard?
Greene said "No" in the glamours.
"I don't think white people just say z...i at the time."
One of the black actors threw a joke by saying "yes."
"You must suppress the R."
Thus, the energy in the room changes, and some kind of sincerity replaces unrest.
Everyone is dedicated to doing this right, not only for the sake of the game, but also for the memory of the four people who were killed.
The stage is starting again.
This time he says the word "Rascona N," sharp and highlighted.
No one's laughing at all.
Revitalization ends violently and quickly.
There's screams, gunfire, and then silence.
A woman dressed in the funeral black stands on the bodies of the actors and reads Billie Holiday's sad eulogy, "Weird Meyva."
In one of the two words, his voice breaks.
An average of four dozen spectators are wipeing out their backs and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost equally divided, black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York to see performance, many of them ahead of the road.
Brooks took them on a sacred journey into the temples of the Malcoms and the Dorseys, all of them endured Georgia's oppressive moisture for almost eight hours.
Up to this point, the killings remained an anecdote, but now it's like the weather is cursed to stand in the same place where the lincin is.
As the song's final notes weaken, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and to examine the bodies.
Children squat on their hands, grasp the fake blood and sedentary bodies and whisper to each other.
A little boy murmurs, like, "They're not really dead."
In a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd and suddenly ends.
The actors throw the lynching rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh in suits playing President Klansman.
Nick Rascona clings to two of his actor friends and tears comes out of his eyes in their arms, and the emotional cost of performance comes to him at the end.
A woman and one whispers, "No problem."
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Then the audience sits down with the actors.
At a table, the white couple from Atlanta are heatedly chatting with a black couple about reenactment.
Denise Duplinski is having trouble finding words about how the performance makes him feel.
He said, "He's heard these horrible, terrible words, and those behaviors come out of people who look like you, and they do it because they look like you."
"What he does to me is that it makes me think that lynchings are still going on," he added, "they are now just called police armed attacks."
At the end of the room, Tyrone Brooks eats at the table and speaks about human rights memories, becomes the center of attention.
He said he's already planning next year's performance.
He said, "Revitalization is inspiring in a way because it describes what we have endured, but it also instructs."
"It's like if you don't learn from this, it might happen again.
Those who do not seek their own past, and those who do not know their own past, are bound to repeat it."

Pearson made 3000 more layoffs to revive the business, cut off the dividend
British training group Pearson said he would make 3,000 more layoffs on Friday and would reduce the margin dividend by 72 per cent, as he began another restructuring programme to overcome the businesses' faced pressures.
According to Chief Executive Director John Fallon, the dismissals, which are mostly at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, will be added to the 4000 positions lost in the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced a plan that would save another 300 million pounds (394 million US$) by trying to restore the rapidly floating business to digital learning with a third cost reduction program.
The company, which agreed to sell its share at Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said there was no change in this year's perspective after notifying its basic sales by 1 per cent in the first half, with an increase of 2.05 billion pounds.
Metin 2 has taken him to his death again!
According to the first report of the Forensic Medicine Institution, Hakan's death is suicide, according to the initial findings in the preliminary autopsy report.
In a detailed examination, no signs of blunt force and algebra were found on the child's body.
The cause of suicide is that the elastic bandage he wraps around his neck is as a result of suffocation.
It was also determined that the gland, which his family stated as a bandage, was elastic bandage used in injuries.
According to the newspaper Habertürk's Müslim Sarıyar, after the preparation of the detailed report on the death of the child, it was learned that the report, which stated that the incident was suicide, will be sent to the Public Prosecutor's Office of Büyükçekmece, which conducts the investigation.
While police investigated the child's suicide in full detail, the investigations on the computer that was confiscated after the incident continue.
It was stated that the police would also refer to the statement of Hakan's friends.
It is also stated that information from Hakan's computer, which his relatives call "cleaned," can also be accessed to third parties or a gang.
Police are evaluating that a gang of suicide may have dragged Hakan into suicide.
The fact that Hakan committed suicide turned his eyes to violent Metin2.
Metin2, which was banned by the Governorship of Antalya last year by the Governorship of Antalya, came up with the murder of 13-year-old "minik hacker" Metin Kang, again in 2009.
In order to play Metin2, designed in Korea in 2005, it is necessary to enter the site and register as a member.
Players are trying to maintain peace and justice in the world with the dragon god in the game.
There are wars in doing so, the dose of violence is increasing.
In addition to the battle scenes, images of war with rigorous weapons such as lines, swords, machetes, axes, as well as images of human beings being destroyed by wild animals and their flesh is eaten.
The player buys characters with money to get stronger.
After the incident on 25 July in the house on Istiklal Neighborhood Köknar Street, the family who buried their children the next day continued to claim the murder.
Baba Mehmet Ekinci said, "All his dream was to be a doctor, we don't think he could harm himself or anyone else because of the game," he said. "They wrapped the elastic wrap on his neck and tied a knot on the side."
He was found that way, son.
We certainly don't think our son can hurt himself and anyone else because of a game online or commit suicide.
We knew he was playing a game like this.
It wasn't a game he was playing.
Let's say he let him out of the game when he gets a little bored.
Anne Gülizar Ekinci said, "No one entering the building.
They say my child entered the house at a certain time.
None of them are revolving.
There was only one chair when his brother came home.
"But when his funeral was found, there were two chairs next to the computer," he said.
İlker KARAŞ: Could be infected with the gang
Families generally pay attention to this issue.
They're looking at me as if my child should be at home and whatever happens.
The child communicates with many people through games.
There may have been a debt-taking situation, or a blasphemy.
Or he invited a person in the game to the house, and there may have been trouble between them.
It may have been an effect not because of the problems he has had with other people whom he communicated through the game rather than directly from the game.
The boy may have thought the visuality and fiction of the game was real.
The suicide trauma could be about blackmail.
If the child has faced a complaint with the family, there is also a depression because he cannot solve this problem.
He couldn't have committed suicide because of the game itself.
There's a chance the kid's getting involved in the gang.
He could be infected with the gang.
There's nothing individually the child could have done alone.
Füsun NEBİL, a IT system consultant: Families should know the interaction of their children
We can't say that the games are harmful.
Research suggests that the games are beneficial for the development of children.
The important thing here is that parents pay attention to what their children play and how they talk to the players online.
Families should know what content children are affected by and take precautions.
There are only 2 children in 5 years in Turkey, which is said to have died due to the game.
Which means that a child's end is not just the influence of games.
I wonder what pushed this kid into this.
We need to find out first.
You have to look at the sociology and psychology around the kid.
8-month return in Borsa Istanbul withstands 50 percent
The BIST 100 index continued its uptrend in December 2016 and continued its rise in July to the 8th month in the top.
Thus, for the first time since July 2007, the index rose by 45.3 per cent in 8 months in a row.
With its performance since the beginning of the year, the BIST 100 index, which surpassed the world's major stock exchanges, including Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan, did not leave the lead on a return basis in July.
The BIST 100 index, which rose by 7.06 per cent in July, was followed by the Dow Jones index in the United States with an increase of 2.54 per cent, and the FTSE 100 index in the UK with a rise of 7.81 per cent.
With the DAX index in Almaya, the Nikkei index in Japan ended July with a devaluation.
As of January-July, the BIST 100 index has performed high on both the major world stock exchanges and the indices of the developing country stock exchanges.
The BIST 100 index, which gained a value of 37.6 percent compared to the 2016 close, was followed by the Dow Jones index with an increase of 10.76 percent, the DAX index with a value gain of 5.55 percent, the Nikkei index with an increase of 4.55 percent, and the FTSE 100 index with an increase of 3.21 percent.
The MSCI EM index, which is an indicator for the developing country's stock exchanges, provided a 23 per cent return.
When you look at the historical process of the BIST 100 index, it has been seen to perform similar performances in the past.
The BIST 100 index, which last completed the last 8 months in a row between December 2006 and July 2007, increased by 38.3 per cent during this period.
The BIST 100 index also completed the 8 months between August 1996 and March 1997, and 9 months between May 1997 and January 1998.
Meksa Investment Research Director Eren Can Ümüt told AA reporter that the BIST 100 index has continued to rise for 8 months, noting that the rise has exceeded 37 per cent since the beginning of the year.
Ümut stated that the MSCI emerging markets (EM) index has risen by 23 percent, and that even when we look at these rates, there is a positive decomposition, he noted:
Funding flows to developing countries since the beginning of the year.
Funds in particular in search of high returns prefer countries that give higher interest rates.
As a result, domestic markets are positively affected.
Of course, the appetite for taking risks on a global scale is also quite high.
In this way, stock indices in the status of risky assets are in demand.
In the United States, we see that new record levels are being tested almost every week, in parallel with the fact that the S&P 500 index has increased by close to 11% since New Year's Eve.
At the beginning of the year, the U.S. Central Baka (Fed) stressed that the estimates of the Central Market 3 interest increase stressed markets, but the Fed used its verbal direction policy to eliminate uncertainty, Ümut noted that there was an insensitive market for the Fed's interest increase.
In the United States, inflation is not yet at the desired level, and the Fed will not be hasty on interest increase and that its expectations that it will avoid radical moves are very effective in current pricing, he said.
"Although the rapid growing US economy expectations of Trump have a positive effect on stock markets, the failure to cancel health reform known as "Obamacare" strengthens the Fed's hand in terms of faster growth and faster inflation in terms of response to faster growth and faster inflation," said Ümüt.
Ümut pointed out that 2016 is a year of many negativities in terms of Turkish markets and said that it is in an effort to close the gap compared to the similar BIST 100 index, which is negatively separated and over-sold.
Noting that they did not see a strong recovery with the domestic news flow, Ümut noted that the current appearance could be interpreted as an increase in the appetite for risk taking abroad and triggering the desire to close the gap compared to the similar ones of the domestic markets.
Ümut stated that he monitored some profit sales in the BIST 100 index, which technically tested new records with 108,600 levels, and noted:
Especially the 109,500-11,000 region is a critical threshold in the short term.
After approaching these levels, it is normal for profit sales to happen.
In the short term, we think a new local or global story should be created for over 110,000 pricing.
For now, the downward transition of 107,500 support can trigger profit sales.
In this case, we follow the 107,000 intermediate support, but I think it might be possible to relax up to 106.000-105,500 zones.
Particularly, breaking 105,500 support can be withdrawn to 104,300 levels, which corresponds to 50 percent of the rise from 100,000 to 108,600.
Both the Fed and the European Central Bank's (ECB) decisions will be at the focal point of the global market, Ümut said, adding that expectations for the Fed are already clear, but the possibility of the balance sheet reduction programme could trigger strengthening in the US dollar, although interest increase is not expected at September FOMC.
Ümut said this could trigger profit sales in the developing country (GOU) stock indices, which is in the shadow of excessive purchases in the short term, and added: "What is important is the ECB will say in addition to this."
After the July monetary policy board meeting, ECB President Mario Draghi said they would discuss the course of monetary policy in the fall, which allowed the euro/dollar parity to rise above 1,1700 levels.
Consequently, statements that the monthly asset purchase programme of 60 billion euros will be reduced or terminated will mean that post-Fed liquidity on a global scale will also be reduced by the ECB.
"Therefore, negative pricing may arise on behalf of the country's markets, which have high current deficits, such as Turkey and which are mandatory access to foreign funds," he said.
Gedik Investment Consultancy Manager Erol Gürcan stated that there was a very serious rally in terms of global stock markets after Trump was elected president in the United States in November 2016.
Gürcan stated that it is possible to say that the main factor that triggers this rally movement is that there are developments that increase global growth expectations, especially Trump's promises to tax deductions.
Borsa Istanbul was also the leader of the stock exchanges that stood out in the global rally.
Although one of the most important reasons for this is that the BIST 100 index has remained highly discounted compared to similar developing country markets in recent years, it is worth noting that the steps taken by policymakers to support the economy and the financial markets have also played a serious role.
In particular, we can say that the Credit Guarantee Fund (KGF), which has been activated as of March, has a serious impact on the rise observed so far in the index.
For the rest of the year, the positive developments are reflected in the pricing significantly and KGF, which has an important role in this rise, has gradually reached satisfaction, stated that although the BIST 100 index remains discounted compared to similar country markets, the search for a new story for the rest of the year can also gradually come to the forefront.
Gürcan noted that the 180-day action plan, which is expected to share its details for a while, and the improvements such as the increase in the limit of the Credit Guarantee Fund, the developments such as the possible tax reduction that has been raised in the recent period can contribute positively in this sense.
Gürcan, Fed, ECB and the UK Central Bank (BoE) will also tighten their current expanding monetary policy stances, even if it is gradually, stressing that important risk factors for developing countries are also among the critical risk factors for developing countries, he said, "The Fed, which has been continuing its moderate interest increases for a while, will likely initiate the balance sheet reduction process after September, the possibility of the ECB's recent deployment of asset purchase, and the possibility of the BOE being one of the major developed country central banks that will increase interest rates after the Fed will be the main developments in this sense that it should be followed in this sense" he made an evaluation.
Gürcan said that the 104.150-104.600 support zone, which corresponds to the 200-hour moving average with the uptrend seen since the beginning of the year, is very critical in the possible correction movements in the index, and he said that if this support zone is broken, the correction movement can continue to be 101,700, 100,000, and 99,200, respectively.
Gürcan stated that if the current upward trend is maintained and the current peak of 108.605 resistance is broken, the index can rise to 110,000-112,000.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO killed in military suicide attack
According to officials, a suicide bomber in Kabul, the Afghan capital, attacked a military convoy, killed a NATO soldier and injured several.
NATO said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
Unconfirstanced local sources say three civilians were killed in the incident in the Karabakh region of the city.
The bombing was the last violent incident in Afghanistan this month; more than 30 people died Tuesday in a mosque explosion in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
The explosion Thursday evening saw an attack on the Afghan army's joint patrol with a "personal-guided explosive", NATO said in a statement.
In the statement, all the injured were in good condition and were under treatment at the US military hospital at the Bagram air base.
The increasing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram, reporters say.
According to the United Nations, Afghanistan witnessed the deaths of at least 1662 civilians in the first half of 2017, with an average of 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomber in Kabul's mostly Shia area killed at least 30 people.
The Taliban said they were the ones who carried out the attack.
On 31 May, after US-led forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001, a giant bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people in the country in the country.
The violence puts emphasis on the unstable security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump's weight on increasing the number of US troops helping the country's military and police.
Suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have led to a crisis in public confidence in the government, his policies, and especially President Ashraf Ghani's reputation.
EPA stops delaying polluted air rule after cases
The U.S. Environmental Protection Organization returned after the 15 states sued the organization of 15 states on the move one day after the decision to delay the law, which is a Obama-transhazing law, demanding that the states prevent emissions that cause dirty smoke.
The EPA announced on Wednesday that it would continue with the "2015 Ozone Decisions", saying the organisation demonstrated its commitment to work with the provinces late Wednesday.
"We believe in dialogue and sensitivity to our state partners," EPA president Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of delaying EPA's ozone decisions by a year until October 2018, with these decisions, the current polluted smoke is measured in various parts of the country and it is decided where it is necessary to cut down to meet more demanding air quality standards.
The 15 states, mostly Democrats, and the Columbia District, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday that this effort was illegal.
The leadership of President Donald Trump continues to seek to reclaim a wider range of landscaping by former president Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda Trump has called to stimulate economic growth.
But these efforts have sparked reactions from the protectionist groups concerned about the impact of Democrats and more emissions on public health.
EPA's website says that ozone-containing air inhalation can "reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as as asthma."
The forest gave the good news...
It's time for stopper and wing transfer!
Beşiktaş President Fikret Orman, Dutch footballer Jeremain Lens and stopper transfer made statements to Bein Sports.
Fikret Orman said...
There's no surprise in the transfer.
Our goal is not to transfer much, it's a point shot.
Now we're going to make a stopper and a wing transfer.
We've got Champions League games, and I hope we'll draw a good draw.
We have to make a wing transfer.
10 million euros is very easy, but we don't have that budget.
If it comes to what we call it, we transfer, and if we don't, we don't die.
I can't tell you anything until I'm clear about the lens.
We're a public company.
The end of patience is peace.
IS NOT the ISIL threat for August 30th?
Response to the Ankara Governorate's banning all collective events, including concerts, including concerts, on the grounds of "ISIL threat", continues.
The governor's ban decision includes the expression "all collective activities," while the 7.
The International Greater Ankara Festival continues.
"August 30th cannot be affected by the bans," Levent Gök, deputy of CHP Group and Ankara deputy, told SÖZCÜ and said:
There's a serious confusion.
Even the governor's office is hesitant about what decision to make...
The duty of the state is to create the areas where the holidays will be celebrated.
"All Ankara has a security problem, only Gökçek's organizations have no security issues," said CHP Ankara deputy Murat Emir.
Ankara Independent MP Aylin Nazlıaka moved the ban to the Parliament.
"Doesn't this prohibition clearly demonstrate the AKP's hostility to the republic and Atatürk? How do you plan to block millions who will celebrate August 30th in the areas?"
"I learned from Edwina myself that I was cheated"
Demet Şener, whose divorce case continued with İbrahim Kutluay, was in Nişantaşı with his lawyer Aslı Hatemi the other day.
Sener filed a moral compensation lawsuit against Edwina Sponza, who allegedly destroyed his nest, and presented the photos of Sponza and Kutluay together with the court as evidence.
"Demet has taken my private photos unlawfully," the socialite beautiful Sponza filed an indictment against Şener.
'I DON'T KNOW I KNOW
After this recent development, Şener met with his lawyer in Nişantaşı Delicatessen and went out of the place when he saw the journalists.
Sener, who was very cheerful, laughed when Edwina Sponza's claim about the photographs was reminded, "God, I must have entered your house and took it."
"There is such a complaint but its content is not correct."
"We have everything, we've offered it to the court," he said.
"In recent years, everyone knew about your husband's relationship with Sponza."
He was amazed at the question, "How did you not know?"
Do what?
How? How?
"I didn't know to swear," said Şener, "Would I have believed in my husband, or was I going to believe the rumor of elalemine?"
"No," Sener said, "No," when journalists insisted, "Did you never heard?" and continued as follows: "I didn't hear it, of course I heard it the first time."
But I've never believed in anything like that.
Everything was normal, it was in place; there was nothing I would suspect.
Ma'am, when I handed over everything, I found out all about it, so...
Sener answered "Yes" to the question "Was it Sponza who sent the evidence?" and conspired the photographs and correspondence he presented to the court by claiming that Sponza himself sent him.
Sponza had previously claimed that his correspondence with Ibrahim Kutluay was the assembly.

Qatar: We broke the embargo within hours thanks to Turkey
Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani, Minister of Economy and Trade of Qatar, said he wanted to express his gratitude to the people of Turkey.
Al Thani: "Thank you very much for your honor and your support to us."
I also send my brother President Recep Tayyip Erdogan the greetings of the Emir of Qatar.
The Qatar economy has proven its resistance.
In many countries, economies are affected, while our economy remains intact.
We must work hard to ensure that Qatar is independent and strong.
We have broken the embargo against us largely thanks to Turkey within hours.
We're missing anything at the moment.
Our natural resources, natural gas exports provide great support to Qatar's economy.
Turkey is not affected by the blockade against us, which is brutally carried out against us.
Today, Qatar continues its production worldwide in natural gas and LNG.
"After what happened, we experienced a 30 per cent increase in our natural gas exports, not a decrease in our natural gas exports," he said.
Stating that the brotherhood relations between Qatar and Turkey and the work in all areas are continuing, Al Thani said, "The trade volume between us was 554 million dollars in the first quarter."
Recently, the decisions have played an important role in this.
As a result of proving Turkish products in the Qatar market, it is extremely important for us to accelerate the entry of goods from Turkey in all sectors and to make investments in many fields.
"I thank you very much for your constructive attitude towards us," he said.
The cost of recent disasters is 300 million TL
TSB President Can Akın Çağlar stated that after the flooding on 18 July, 7 thousand damage reports were made to the insurance companies with 116 million TL, 800 damage reports were received in the Gökova earthquake on 21 July and on 27 July, 22 thousand damage reports were received in the flood and hail in Istanbul and 22 thousand damage reports of 168 million liras in the last three incidents to the insurance, he noted.
Çağlar, "In terms of casko insurance, the damage caused by the hail is 3,500 lira per vehicle and the glass damage is around 1,000 liras."
"The average housing damage in the earthquake is 6 thousand liras," he said.
Can Akın Çağlar emphasized that they are making intensive efforts as a sector for the compensation of economic losses. 3 out of 4 people do not have housing insurance, one in every 2 enterprises does not have fire insurance, and 2 out of 3 people are not insurance insurance, he said: "The risk of natural disasters is increasing due to climate change."
Due to the low insurance rate in our country, the risk of facing serious damage costs of our citizens and institutions is growing day by day.
All these costs should not be left on the state.
Insurance policies are not as expensive as they think, but insurance is not only a sector that pays damages, but also risk management consultancy.
Increasing the insurance awareness and insured rate is very important for our people and our country.
Can Akın Çağlar writes that "Kasko insurance generally states that insured should report their damages within 5 business days, and that time ended yesterday."
"Is there going to be an insurance victim?" he answered: "Although there is such a period under general circumstances, the statute of limitation in the Commercial Code is 2 years."
"In addition, these events are natural disasters, so there is no need for insured to panic, no company will say they don't pay," he said.
That's how the German media saw the giant tender!
During a period of increasing difficulties between Turkey and Germany, it was noted that the German Siemens company won Turkey's first Wind Energy Renewable Energy Resource Areas (YEKA) tender.
The German media announced the remarks that "German Siemens won the giant tender in Turkey."
"Consorium will invest over $1 billion of wind plants," DWelle Turkish reported, reported that the Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon consortium won the YEKA tender.
"The tender for the creation of a thousand megawatt wind power capacity is Turkey's first YEKA tender," the news said, "The number of companies competing in the tender today has decreased from 8 to 2, the Chinese Mingyang consortium and the Chinese Mingyang consortium faced, and the Chinese Mingyang consortium was withdrawn from the tender when the 30th round started.
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak made a statement after the tender and made striking statements about Turkey-Germany relations.
The tender resulted in the win of the German company Siemens, and we can say that this picture is an important message to the region and the world.
In terms of 200 years of historical cooperation between Turkey and Germany, I think this result will make an important contribution to Turkey-Germany relations.
No matter how regional crises in the world, I was proud to present with this tender that Turkey is one of the most reliable investment-making countries in the region and the world.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible challenge
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who would cross paths to showcase the most satisfying boxing match in the near future for 147 pounds, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
Garcia, the lightweight champion of the Invincible World Boxing Council, was in separate rooms at the ESPN offices in Los Angeles until they marched the aisle and greeted Lomachenko, the world boxing organization super featherweight champion.
On Saturday, unanimously, after Garcia defeated the former world champion in fourweights, both fighters are among the top five members of the unsuspecting list.
Garcia reached out to her right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN at 7 p.m. Saturday night.
While the two posed for the photographs, Lomochenko's manager, Egis Klimar, noted that a potential competition between fighters would be "perfect size."
Garcia reminded me, "I'm an old feather dick."
"I'm up high for the buroner, but I'm not that big.
I'm a little for 140.
I want to get down to the light.
He's got to pass lightweight (135 pounds), then we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them this."
Lomachenko joined.
"The box needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on 'pay and watch'; set a date for the next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) and let Lomachenko fight in an opening match of 135 pounds this year, and Garcia is interested in fighting with the winner of the Jorge Linares-Luk Campbell match for the lightweight title at the Forum on September 23.
"The fight may be in the pay and watch because all the fans want it," Garcia said, and later he said it was open to whoever channel offered the best financial package.
We're the main names.
No other name would be of that much interest.
Whenever they're ready..."
Garcia said she appreciated Lomachenko as a "great fighter" and could attend Saturday's match.
But Lomachenko hesitated to praise Garcia for a lot of pouches and said that he thought the threeweight champions of the threeweight champions from Riverside looked "very slow," "sorry, Mikey... knockout asked for it."
Garcia said the focus was first to show the punch power and then boxing.
Both said they felt that momentum was created for their own encounter.
"This is a fight that needs to be done.
Another fight doesn't create such a concern and rumour.
Garcia said, "I'm so happy to deal with this."
Lomachenko said: "I waited for the best fighters, and he's Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight."
Turkish rest from Russia to America
The White House does not intend to impose sanctions that will affect Moscow's pipeline construction, but sanctions against Russia may increase the cost of these lines.
This is due to the increase in the cost of borrowing.
Concerns about Western investment partners thinking about withdrawing from projects due to sanctions, the Kremlin accelerated the construction of pipelines.
The Swiss company Allseas Group, which built the Turkish Stream line, which is planned to reach Turkey under the Black Sea, accelerated construction at the request of Gazprom.
Reuters reported that Gazprom has also begun the construction of a second pipeline parallel to the Turkish Stream "quickly" in order to export more gas to Europe.
New results of Sweden's asylum age evaluation test announced
The latest results of the evaluation tests of refugees subjected to a new method of medical age assessment in Sweden have ruled that more than 80 per cent of respondents are over 18 years of age, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these tests.
The Swedish National Forensic Medicine and Drug Administration (Réttsmedicinalverket) began conducting tests earlier this year.
The tests were designed to make the age assessment more accurate in the asylum process after the Swedish Immigration Agency (Migrationsverket) criticized the failures of some refugees to assess their correct age.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to the test, and the Forensic Medicine and Drug Administration has announced the results of a total of 2481 of the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002 units) were ruled to be 18 or higher, and in 25 cases the Forensics and Drug Administration ruled that the subject was "probably 18 or above."
In 432 cases, the result was that the person was "probably below 18."
The tests were conducted only in cases where the age of the person was suspicious.
According to Johan Göransson of the coroner's office, the results are consistent with the past months.
"We do not see a major difference in statistics according to the past months, the figures are quite consistent," he told The Local.
The proportion of cases that are ruled over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that the proportion of cases is that refugees are lying about their age.
In May, the apartment announced the results of the 581 test, saying there were 442 cases where "the viewed was shown to be 18 or older".
When the newspaper Svenska examined the results of the 581 cases announced, it found that 243 cases explicitly declared that they had reached the age of 18 this year.
The method of medical age evaluation, which includes x-raying 20 years of teeth and performing MRI scans of knee joints, then analyzing them to dentists and radiologists, is criticized in some circles.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist of the Karolinska Institute, who evaluates the biological maturity of people who have studied whether it is premature than usual or late.
"I have reasons to think about it, and I don't think that should be the measurement of the type used.
It's very suspicious to decide that way of biological life.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend to be," he told Metro.
However, Göransson from the Forensics and Drug Administration argued that the tests are correct: "You can say that the risk of being misjudged that a child is an adult in general, is small.
The biggest risk is that the person is just under the age of 18, and in this case, the risk is around 10 per cent."
Yıldız Hamidiye Mosque opens to worship today
Yıldız Hamidiye Mosque, built by Abdulhamit in 1885 by architect Nikolaidis Jelpuylo, will be opened to worship with Friday prayer today after the restoration works.
Regional Director Mürsel Sarı said that the restoration works, which started in June 2013, were completed and the mosque was ready for the opening.
Sarı gave the following information: "The restoration works were carried out in 2 contexts."
The first part was the repair of the mosque, the main building.
The second part was landscaping.
In the first part, about 16 million liras were spent and about 11 million liras for landscaping.
First of all, the bullets of the wooden dome were opened, after they were renewed, the external walls, the dirt consisting of external factors, were free of rust.
Drains have been made on solidification.
As seen when we came into the mosque, there are very rich decorations.
It's a work with star motifs. He's very rich in pen work.
There's a mixed style here.
"Selchivet traces are also seen, considering that it was made in the Ottomans and 1885s, baroque style has started to be a factor in architecture."
ABDÜLHAMİT HAS A SECTION
"The chandelier in the middle of the mosque is the German Emperor 2.
There were partial failures, renewed and cleaned and hanged in place.
It's a really valuable and important piece.
There are wooden cages, which are symmetrical on both sides of the mosque, which we call salutation.
We know that these were made by our great rightful owner, Abdulhamit Khan, who built the mosque himself.
So we have information that he did these things himself with his own hands and was assembled here.
They're still standing here as they are.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is also expected to attend the opening ceremony of the mosque, Sarı said.
Pantic claim in Göztepe
Ukrainian media reported that the 25-year-old Serbian footballer, who failed to qualify for Dinoma Kiev, could be rented to the yellow-red club.
Pantic started playing for Serbia's Red Star team, playing for Villarreal, Cordoba, Eibar and Alaves in Spain.
Pantic signed Dynamo Kiev during halftime last season
West Virginia governor announces change of party
Jim Justice, Democratic governor of West Virginia, announced on Thursday evening that he would change his party at a rally with President Trump.
Governor Justice said, "Welcome or not, the Democrats have left me."
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and thoughts... today as Western Virginians, I will tell you today, I can no longer help you as a Democratic Governor."
The rally has been cheered.
"So I'm going to change my record to Republicans tomorrow," Justice added.
"If I were a technical director, I'd say it's time for you to start a different game."
Mr. Trump had already promised to make an important announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Democratic candidate Justice did not support Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes says he owns coal mines in 5 states, with his father's coal business.
Its existence is about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Congress issued a statement Thursday evening saying that "Vali Justice's change of party was another coup against the Democratic Party, which preferred to work to prevent it rather than make our country big again".
"With only 15 governorates in history and at least a number of state legislatures, Governor Justice's announcement is only the last rejection of a party that is unselfish and cannot find a positive, unifying message," RNC female spokesman Ronna McDaniel told CBS.
I will do the best for Turkey
The third Olympics, the Turkish record holder.
He was born in Cuba, but he was the homeland of Turkey where he came for F. Bahce...
In 2013, he became a Turkish citizen and wore the national jersey...
First he became the European champion, then the third one in the Olympics...
Now it is one of the most important medals in Turkey at the World Championships in Athletics.
Yasmani Capello, who competed in the 400-meter disability, spoke to SABAH before the championship, which will start today.
They didn't want you when they were young, they didn't like their degree in Cuba.
You've improved the coaching.
Then they called me, but this time you didn't leave.
Some think you chose Turkey for money.
What do you think?
The last thing I remember about Cuba was my departure from the national team.
From that moment on, I've drawn a line to what I've been through, what I've been through.
Then I came to Turkey with the invitation of the Fenerbahçe club.
The team's initiative was thanks to Fenerbahçe.
They offered me an offer for reinforcements.
I have opened a new page with Turkey.
I had a lot of injuries in my youth, but after the opportunities offered to me in Turkey, I had significant successes in Rio and Amsterdam.
I can't wait to do the best at the World Championships in Athletics and win a different title.
You were at a press conference recently.
Can you tell us why?
Whenever a question is asked about Turkey's claim, I think of my childhood, and I think of my being kicked out of the Cuban National Team at the age of 23.
And of course, people in Turkey are approaching me.
When I won the gold medal at the European Championships in Amsterdam, I felt things like that when the National Anthem was played.
I couldn't hold back my tears.
I would like to thank Turkey for having the opportunity to make my dreams come true.
I am very happy to belong to the Turkish National Team.
I'll be here until my legs run.
You said you might have a Turkish girlfriend before.
You're with a Turk now, you went to Cuba together.
Do you want to share what you've been through?
The biggest plus of being with a Turk is calmness...
When I compare it with Cuban women, peace...
Turkish girls take care of their relationship.
Your girlfriend's also your assistant coach.
You're together all day, like, interfere with your diet?
He eats more dessert than I am.
(They're both laughing) I don't actually have a very strict saying, but from time to time, it interferes with what I eat.
My coach, Massimo Matrone, often gives strict warnings on my diet, but I know that this is for my own good.
How's your girlfriend cooking for you with Turkish food?
Turkish women cook very well, but my lover makes it better.
(Laughs) If it is dry beans-pilav, my first choice.
ONA ONLY I'M GULLET
My coach in Cuba didn't believe me.
He took other young people in my place.
After winning medals for Turkey, we met in Cuba.
Looking at me, he showed me to the young athletes next to him and said, "Look, I raised him."
I just laughed at him.
EYE LIMITATION
The glasses you wear in the races are the subject of curiosity...
I only use it for concentration.
As soon as I put the glasses on, I cut off my relationship with the world and weave walls on both sides.
I'm just focusing on the finish line, and I don't see anything else.
What comes first when we say Tokyo 2020?
Felix Sanchez.
At the 2012 London Olympics, he won the gold medal at the 400 metres handicapped at the age of 35.
If he can do it, I can do it in Tokyo, why not?
TURKCELL SUPPORTS
Turkcell Deputy General Manager Ismail Tüm said that they believe that Yasmani Capello will succeed in London and said, "We sincerely believe that Yasmani will represent our flag in this championship in the best way possible."
We wish success to all our athletes who will compete in London.
"We will continue to support the further development of Turkish athletics and for greater successes to our country," he said.
Coe praises the 'sincere' apology he wants for Russia's doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the boss of global athletics, praised Russia's sincere apology based on the doping scandal, but stressed that the time for the country to be re-accepted into sports is not right.
Russia's athletics boss, Dmitry Shylakhtin, told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics that it was right to ban his country from sports and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he apologized to "all athletes who were forcibly taken from the gold and silver medals in the competitions."
Despite his assessments, the IAAF Congress voted for the continuation of the ban in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"Today I think it is a very friendly response, a very sincere presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The whole council and the whole congress were pleased... From the acceptance of the Russian Federation, the fact that he has survived very turbulent days, and that he has done everything possible to ensure the restructuring of the federation..."
Russia's "satis" is also for accepting its re-acceptance criteria, Coe said.
"I think it's a very constructive day, and I think it's been taken, but Congress supports the proposal that the task force is not the right time to restore the rights of Russia," Coe said.
"In the next few months, we must do everything to normalize this situation.
Our guiding principle has always been to want to separate clean athletes from the defective system," he added.
Meeting the strict IAAF criteria, the nineteen Russian athletes will compete neutrally at the World Championships in Athletics, which will begin on Friday in London.
Rune Andersen, the head of the IAAF task force, said on Monday that Russia has not yet met many criteria for the return of its rights.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council in London, he told reporters that the drug test was still inadequate and that the banned coaches still work freely.
Denial of news from the US to YPG tank
The U.S. Embassy in Ankara announced that no tanks were given to any parties fighting in Syria.
Allegations have been denied that hundreds of trucks filled with tanks and weapons have been sent to the YPG.
"Declaration of the media about the wrong news about the trucks going to Syria," the embassy said:
In a series of untrue reports in the press in the last few days, it has been claimed that the United States has misledly sent hundreds of trucks full of tanks and weapons to Syria to support the YPG.
These reports ignore some of the fundamental facts regarding the current situation in Syria.
The United States did not give tanks to any group fighting against Deasha in Syria.
A large portion of the US military assistance, primarily composed of light weapons and ammunition, supports the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAK) elements within the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG).
The Syrian Arabs, including the SAK, are fighting to clear the Decare from the region and reunite their homes.
ISPAT President Ermut: Direct foreign investment will be over last year
ISPAT President Arda Ermut said 55 per cent of the investment received last year came after July.
Ermut said that there was no decrease in investments due to the July 15th FETÖ coup attempt, but on the contrary, there was an increase. "Maybe there would be more increase, it has hit."
Maybe if these conditions didn't occur, if there were some regional developments, we could see a greater increase with the multiplier effect.
That's why we're more hopeful for next year.
Hopefully it will be a brighter year in terms of direct investment.
As of the first five months, we're going up by 11% compared to the first 5 months of last year.
But we don't think that's enough.
"We hope it will be more."
"It is not that it does not concern us, whether it is global and regional developments," Ermut said, stressing that they are trying to diversify investors.
Ermut, reminding that 75 per cent of direct investments came from Europe by 2010, continued as follows:
That's down to 66 per cent.
Again, Asia's share increased from 2 per cent to 7-8 per cent.
Russia's share has increased.
While we were trying to do this, the Gulf countries had some problems among themselves.
Turkey has good relations with all of them, especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar two important actors.
But the problem between these two countries upsets us and, in its form, allows investors to postpone their decisions a little more.
It is not only in terms of investments in Turkey, but therefore we may be experiencing some delays.
Arda Ermut reminded that there were some incidents with Germany last week, but the government, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, reacted clearly and definitively.
"Look, problems are among governments, absolutely not among the people," President Erdogan's reaction said when they talked about investors of the countries where the harshest political crisis took place.
Secondly, these people came and invested in my country.
These are no different to us than Turkish companies.
On the contrary, when they have the slightest problem, they will come to us, we will.
"We're definitely not going to let them be victims." expressing that it is in the form, Ermut said that they continue to support all investors with the comfort of this.
"We can guarantee that in the next period."
You'll see that neither German companies, nor in any way, investors from countries where we have some political problems will not have any problems.
On the contrary, hopefully, we will do our best to increase the investments from these countries.
We think that investments from here will continue to increase.
Political developments, of course, can sometimes affect perceptions of the investment environment.
"But we will do our best at this point and do our best with the aim of not being affected by the perception of the investment environment of our investors."
ISPAT President Ermut explained that after a single generation of one-way strategy, Turkey has started to attract great attention from China, but they expect the biggest investment from the Gulf if the problems in the Gulf are solved.
"In the relations with Germany, there are not one investors who say, "We had trouble because of these relationships, we had investments because of this incident, we are fleeing," Ermut said, noting that there are companies that come, come and follow.
"At the moment, nearly 10 percent of our portfolio projects are from German companies."
So almost 10 percent of the companies we've been seeing from all over the world are German companies.
Some of them are companies that are currently invested in Turkey.
He's going to grow his investment or he's got a topic, and he's open as a project.
"Therefore, German companies are actually still a significant part of our daily workflow," he said.
Emphasizing that all state institutions should be careful during the periods when perception operations were carried out to Turkey, Ermut said that the issue was sensitive and could be affected by the slightest bad communication.
Ermut stated that what happened in the past 2-3 weeks is a good lesson and explained the following:
The agenda of investors and politicians is always different.
We've always seen that economic relations always allow political developments to take a kind of path.
Germany will remain an important business partner and an important investor of ours.
Because they already have a lot of investments in Turkey.
Unfortunately, the election agenda in Germany increases such rhetoric.
I think that when they're past, it's gonna be a little better.
In Saudi Arabia, the two countries pay attention to not making any negative statements.
As a result, an investor investing in Turkey is investing by targeting all the environmental country markets.
So it wasn't because of Saudi Arabia, but there were processes that slowed down a little because of the uncertainty in the region.
But we're still negotiating with these investors.
My personal opinion is that investors are holding a decision that they may be able to make faster.
"Negatively, I see uncertainty due to the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, I am getting out of here," we do not have Saudi investors.
On the contrary, we still have Saudi investors who continue to live in Turkey, who meet with us while we are doing their holiday here and follow all the processes.
Arda Ermut reminded that the international direct investments (IDY) that came to Turkey last year were 12.3 billion dollars and said, "I think we will definitely pass it this year.
"But how long we will pass, these regional developments will affect global uncertainties," he said.
While hoping that the impact will normally be more, Ermut stated that it may be a little more limited, and that the first 5 months will be increased by 11% and this can be protected, and he said, "I hope that if there is no bad development, I believe that we will definitely close the end of the year than last year."
Pointing out that a significant part of the investments will continue to be real estate, Ermut gave information that new investments in the field of logistics, health, fintech, information, petrochemical, food, energy and manufacturing can be seen.
Emphasizing that there will be new investments to announce in the coming months, Ermut said, "We may soon have an investment announcement in terms of manufacturing."
Not a billion dollars, but a big investment.
"There may also be investments from interan countries," he said.

How will the financial rules of football affect Neymar’s departure to Paris?
The rules for preventing unlimited spending of European football clubs will not hinder Neymar’s world record transfer from Spain to Paris-Saint Germain of France.
From the prestigious Champions League tournament, the European government unit, which has the power to ban teams, may result in any results from UEFA to Paris Saint-Germain.
The Financial Fair Game rules, issued by UEFA in 2011, mean that they will eventually show that Neymar finances his transfer without massive losses in front of the PSG.
Barcelona was paid 222m euros ($262m) to buy the Brazilian only outside of his contract, and Neymar will rule on a salary that will cost tens of millions of dollars a year.
Some of the financial aspects of Neymar's departure to France are:
Given the team's money from the energy-rich Qatari family, the PSG can, of course, pay the money to sign Neymar and add it to the other star galaxy.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to recruit players, but they have to balance it with legitimate sources of income, provided they get head-to-head in their football business.
The FFP was designed by Michel Platini after being elected to UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had suffered great debts in pursuit of success were active fraudulently, and that if banks or owners withdraw their support, they were at risk of bankruptcy.
In 2011, FFP began monitoring the losses of clubs rather than focusing on the debts of the clubs.
The change meant that the model that Roman Abramovic first used in Chelsea in 2003 (take a potential club, make high expenditure to improve the team and create a global brand) would turn into a more difficult enterprise.
During the three-year FFP assessment period, which lasted until 2018, clubs could suffer 30m euros in losses.
Although Platini was unreputably removed from the presidency in 2015, his successor in UEFA, Aleksander Cefer, is still committed to giving up excessive expenditure.
"FFP has definitely not died, and we will surely strengthen the rules forward," Andrea Traverso, who led the FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will pay the purchase clause of Neymar collectively, it may extend the amount to the contract period for accounting reasons.
Neymar signed a 5-year deal, so the transfer fee can be cited as a cost of 44.4m euros in the annual accounts of the next 5 years.
The first wave of 2014 FFP sanctions saw the implementation of the heaviest sanctions to Manchester City, owned by PSG and Abu Dhabi.
The PSG was subsequently fined 60 million euros ($82 million for the time), which was later reduced to 20m euros, and was ordered to limit the Champions League team to 21 players, normally 25 for the 2014-2015 season.
UEFA is on the lookout against clubs that can try to deceive financial regulators by inflating its income through companies linked to the club's owners.
Although a Qatari company can sponsor PSG, if it is thought that the value of sponsorship exceeds standard market values, UEFA will not allow this to be considered a justified income.
This was what happened when UEFA ruled in 2014 that the Qatar Tourism Authority had been inflated for PSG sponsorship.
Some of Neymar's PSG profits could come through payments from Qatar's 2022 World Cup organizational committee.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 denied that Neymar would become the World Cup ambassador, and such a move could be easily revealed by UEFA regulators.
The sanctions imposed on the PSG in the past mean that UEFA will be even more careful against attempts to overcome the rules.
According to those who are committed to the issue on Tuesday, UEFA is not in a preventive meeting with the PSG regarding Neymar's transfer.
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that they remain confidential, since they are not authorized to discuss the status of the PSG.
Recent accounts show that PSG made more than 10m euros in turnover of 542.4m euros in 2015-16.
Last fiscal year's accounts have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to contribute to sponsorship agreements, souvenirs and jersey sales.
The club expects the turnover to rise by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish league, which was clearly disturbed by the departure of one of the biggest players in football, tried to prevent Neymar from going to the PSG for alleged violation of the FFP.
"This is an open case of 'financial doping' with the club and its state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish daily AS, referring to the fact that Qatar is the definitive owner of the PSG.
Arsenal director Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to an American sports giant, shares concerns about the financing of La Liga by a state.
"This is a result of possession and has completely changed the entire ground of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Everything is possible when a country has a club once.
It's hard to respect Financial Fair Play because for a country, such a great player's representation of a country can lead to different methods or different interests.
"Retail price" rebellion from insurers
According to TSB data, the insurance sector has been losing traffic since 2006.
The sector, which lost TL 2.35 billion in 2015, made only TRY 19 million profit in 2016.
Axigorta, Anadolu Sigorta and Güneş Sigorta are traded in Borsa Istanbul.
Speaking at the meeting where the results of the TSB in 2017 were evaluated, Çağlar said that the 11-year loss in traffic insurance reached TRY 7.3 billion, and that the loss of the sector with the ceiling premium application would increase to 2.3 billion TL this year and the estimated damage-prim rate to 125 percent.
Çağlar, who said that the 2015 figure will be caught this year, noted that the loss written in 2012 and 2015 also took the profits of other branches, and said, "This means that by financing the bad driver, we increase the price of the citizen's housing policy."
"75 per cent of the sector is foreign and our partners abroad are in financing the bad driver in a sense," he said.
The ages continued as follows:
We don't expect a profit from traffic, but based on the past 11 years, we can't show that we've made a profit for a year.
"We agree to this, but we hope that we can carry that damage in a reasonable environment with other policies," he said.
Çağlar said that there were dramatic price increases when other traffic losses also led to the profitability of other products. "In 2012, there were around 30 percent price increases in traffic insurance, almost doubled in 2015, we wrote the biggest loss in our history."
"Even in an environment where prices increase so much, our profit in traffic at the end of 2016 was only 19 million TL," he said.
Çağlar said that they expect the free tariff to be passed next year. "We will lower the price of the good driver in the free tariff and apply high prices to the bad driver."
"However, the Treasury is looking at the general course, the last word about when it will be in the Treasury," he said.
The Undersecretariat of Treasury stated that the rise in compulsory traffic insurance premiums since 2015 has affected a wide part of the society, and has switched to the maximum premium (ceiling price) application since 12 April.
Accordingly, each group of vehicles related to compulsory traffic insurance policies, steps and traffic density and accident statistics were taken into consideration and the maximum premiums related to compulsory traffic insurances were determined on the basis of the province groups determined.
On the other hand, as of July, the "Risk Insured Pool" application was implemented for the damaged frequency high-level or vehicle groups in compulsory traffic insurance.
The premium and damages related to the traffic insurance policies within the scope of the pool will be shared among the insurance companies.
The premium of these insured will be determined by the Undersecretariat of Treasury.
Çağlar said that in the first 6 months of 2017 in traffic with the application of ceiling premiums, premium production decreased by 11.5 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, the number of policies increased by 8.6 million with an increase of 4.9 percent, and the reduction in traffic policies reached about 30 percent, given in inflation.
Çağlar said that traffic will take profits in other branches this year. "This damage cannot be sustained at these ceiling prices.
How much longer can the sector carry this harm?"
Çağlar said that the capital of all companies in the sector is 9 billion TL, and only 2.3 billion TL is damaged by traffic, the capital of the sector will be completed in three years. "Foreigners are financing the bad driver, 'Why do I feel thousands of money finances the bad driver in Turkey?'
"At this point, we are trying to explain our problem to the Treasury," he said.
After these developments, Çağlar asked a question that foreigners had not reached the point of weight reduction in the Turkish insurance sector, "They have not reached that point yet."
They expect to invest more in Turkey because in the Netherlands, on average 6 policies per person, in Turkey this 1.3.
"Therefore, Turkey is a place that should really grow," he said, and continued as follows:
So they didn't give up here.
However, the company achieves reasonable profitability every year, but it is using it to ensure the company's growth by leaving all profits in its system.
According to TSB data, premium production in the sector was TL 40.5 billion in 2016, and in the first half of this year, it was TL 23.1 billion with an increase of 12 percent compared to the same period last year.
Caglar said he predicted that the sector would not complete the year with a growth of 15 per cent in total premium production.
News of social assistance for thousands of chronic patients
The details and implementation principles of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Fighting Chronic Diseases," which started to work with the instructions of Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, Minister of Family and Social Policies, have been determined.
The outreach programme, which will be launched for poor citizens and their families, will benefit from 4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients in the first stage.

One of the 10 companies to invest is still German
Arda Ermut, President of the Prime Ministry Investment Support and Promotion Agency of Turkey, stated that the political tension between the two countries is not reflected in the business world, as the German companies in Turkey.
"In the relations with Germany, there is no investor who says, "We have had trouble because of this situation, we are running away," Ermut said.
"About 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are German companies."
Some of them have investments in Turkey.
"Germans make up an important part of our daily workflow," he said.
Ermut stated that Abraaj Group's partner in the logistics company Netlog is a good example.
Abraaj Group Partner Omar Syed pointed out the economic growth in Turkey and said, "We have invested a total of $1 billion in Turkey."
Özer, On the way to becoming the Last Ottoman
It was reported that the experienced footballer, who had given the management two weeks to find a club, had signed with Osmanlıspor and would sign an official contract in the coming days.
At the beginning of the last season, Özer Hurmacı signed a contract with the green-black club until 2019, with 4 hours before the end of the transfer, and played in 29 leagues, 2 cup matches, and made a significant contribution to the team with 5 goals and 4 assists.
The administration, which blocked the way back to Ozer, signed with Brazilian Sergio Antonio yesterday, replacing this player.
The transfer of the century has come true!
Barcelona announced that Neymar had transferred to Paris Saint-Germain for a fee of 222 million euros.
Recently, the transfer development, which was followed by the public, was formalized.
PSG added the star name to the Catalan team for the Brazilian player, paying the player's release fee of 222 million euros.
Neymar was the most expensive transfer in the history of football with the price of this service.
France 1. Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) of the Football League (Ligue 1) announced that he had signed a five-year contract with Brazilian star Neymar.
The club's website said that Neymar, a 25-year-old, who became the world's most expensive footballer, signed a contract for PSG until June 30, 2022, with a fee of 222m euros on the price of termination.
Speaking after the signing ceremony, Neymar said he was very happy to wear the jersey at the French representative, "Since I started my football life in Europe, PSG has always been one of the most challenging and ambitious teams."
The reason I came to this club and joined my teammates, to get many cups as our fans wanted."
The PSG will pay Neymar 45m euros for each season.
Thus, the cost of the star player will cost the French representative at a price of over 400m euros.
The strike of marine workers ended with a raise
The agreement was not reached in the increase clause in the collective agreement between İZDENİZ A.Ş., the company of Izmir Metropolitan Municipality, and the Turkish Maritime Union (TDS) affiliated to Turkish-Is.

We're happy to leave the table.
An average share of 28 per cent on the sea and 20 per cent on land will be in the sea pocket.
We had friends who worked at minimum wage levels.
We've made serious improvements in their salaries.
Nostalgia, "Wet Hot American Writing" and "Commigrating Detective"
So, for the bright days of the characters in the '80s, for the grunge period of the '90s (the time when brains like David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State"), and for 2001, their stars, Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, before they went on with bigger things, this version of the story is nostalgic for all of them.
As a cultural product, this is both the titification and the itrocization of our permanently memorized Facebook period.
But as a series, it's like it's out of time.
The "First Day of the Camp" was unexpectedly successful, and this was not just because of its absurd humor (inside, H. There was a story about the origins of a box of a talking plant voiced by Jon Benjamin.)
Concentrating on the main humor (the middle-aged actors playing the underlying children of the minors) realized the impossible to recapture the past part of the joke.
Now, the parody is more random, including a monologue about the "Ten Years Later," which adults play with adults, less emotionally resistant and the perverse stalker film of the 90s, such as the "Hand Sharing Five".
At one point, the character confuses an Apple Powerbook, some one-row-wheel skates, and "a lot of other things from the year 1991."
Most of the stories are the same.
Soft-hearted Coop (Mr Showalter) is now a writer, still unable to forget Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And now George H. W. There is another crazy treacherous plan involving Ronald Reagan (earth Mr Showalter) who was instigated by Bush (a very well-comfort imitation by Michael Ian Black).
As usual, the best part of the series is intermediate lyrics.
Especially the young Mr., who always has Matt Dillon's under-lip beard in "Single." It's nice to see Rudd, which is his most popular child in the old school, Andy, seems to be a morbid now.
There may be random moments of insanity that power this series (e.g., in the "Seven Up!" series that reproduce as a kind of repeated "Seven Up!" until I reach what I think is the logical result of what I think is a logical result: "Wet Hot American Writing" in the last scene, which allows him to go to see the premiere of the movie "Wet Hot American Writing."
Meanwhile, the "Commander Detective" in Amazon refers to a different genre of nostalgia: "The Americans' Cold War resurrection, the film "Blonde Bomb" and even the iconography of the East, West wrestling, "GLOW."
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy, directed by Rhys Thomas, appears to have been found TV: a 1980s Romanian police friends drama in which two Bucharest police officers struggled for the real, atheism and Marxist-Leninist road.
The lead roles are played by the wolf Gregor and the idealist Iosef, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, and the English dubbing of their dialogue is performed by Channing Tatum (both the lead producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a brilliant idea.
But it's nothing more than an idea.
There are some nice visual funnyness (Americans spend time watching chess on TV while watching football)
The famous voice-over artist staff, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloé Sevigny, are a good material for the game "who knows the voice."
But "Friend Detective" is so committed to the likeness of a cling propaganda drama to the truth (including a murderer wearing a Reagan mask), he often plays exactly the same.
Six long episodes don't pass, and comedy isn't quick enough or not.
While Gregor and Iosef were constantly visiting the American embassy, where two fat men who always eat a pile of kegs in his lobby, the "Commander Detective" could better perform propaganda hicvin if it was shortened to a narrower length.
The message to the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn into food that will defeat anything in a series.
Fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we do this to our own close past and even theirs.
The Assassination of FETÖ, the Kadıyâns
After fifty years of experience, the British government has seen that our family is loyal and selfless.
The government's supreme authorities have acknowledged that this family has since sincerely adhered to the British Government and has provided great services.
He needs to be smart and careful about this seedling planted by the British government with his own hands, to investigate everything thoroughly and to make a careful decision.
While trying to understand FETÖ, the organization of Hashshashis as its starting point is addressed, but an forgotten difference is that FETÖ is an organization that emerged in the imperialist period and acts with colonialist saiks.
In my opinion, the 'leading movement' that should be addressed in this minval is the Kadiyâns.
In the British praise at the entrance, the founder of Kadıyâlik was the founder of Kadıyâni, Mirza Gulâm Ahmet Kadiyâni, who described himself as the "physher sapling planted by the hands of the British Government."
"On December 188, God had ordered him to pledge his allegiance from his supporters and form a separate congregation," said Gulam Ahmed, born in Kadiyan, a small town in the state of Punjab, India.
Gulâm Ahmed went a little further in 1891, according to the revelation and inspiration he received. He said that Mary, like other prophets, died in death, and that God sent her to the Almighty and the Muslim, as a meshadow and a mehd, which the Christians and the Muslims were waiting for.
According to this, the meshadow and the mehdi that the Muslims expect are the same person and this is Mirza Gulâm Ahmed Kadiani.
(Islam Encyclopedia, TDV)
In India, which became completely British dominated after the Sipahi uprising in 1857, Gulâm Ahmed, who wrote books defending the persecuted Muslims against Hindus and Christians, reminds of the portrait of Gülen, which defends Islam against Islam against religiousism with the President of the Association for Combating Communism in Erzurum, which was thought to have been founded entirely by holy people, but which was thought to have been founded entirely by holy-winged truths, but which was later revealed by CIA support.
Like Gülen, Gulâm Ahmed's favorite idea by imperialists is that "jihad" is a struggle only with the Muslim's own self, and if you can live his religion freely, there is no dimension of imperialism to fight.
In fact, Gülen went one step further and even the attacks of the Crusaders, whose wound in our history were still open, praised in a 'vaaz' last year: "It is not too dangerous for the vic to invade your country.
There are red lines between you and them.
For once, they don't touch your woman, your daughter.
They don't touch the temple, the unadulterated crusaders!
The idea that Mahdi and the messiah unite in themselves, that his own community will be the savior of Islam, the concept of jihad only means to fight the soul, aside from the similarity of the theses with FETÖ, the way Kadıyâiism spread was generally realized in the field of education and civil society.
The total number of the Kadıyâns in the world, which is said to have exceeded 2 million, is 1869, and the number of countries in which the emergency aid organization "Humanity First" is officially registered is 23.
In addition, 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 dispensaries in 55 countries, 8 printing houses belonging to Kadıyâni only in Africa; 505 educational institutions in 11 countries and approximately 16,000 mosques in the world.
"The first Muslim scientist" who received the Nobel Prize, Prof. Considering that Abdus Salam, Sir Zaferullah Khan, who was the President of the United Nations Court of Justice, is also Kadiyâni, Mahershala Ali, the Muslim actor who received the first Oscar award, we can see the depth of the approval of the global forces to the Kadıyâni.
Let's note that the Kadıyâni's meeting with 30,000 people in England was also polished as a torso show.
A brief view of their history is enough for Kadıyâns, whose slogan is "Love everyone, do not hate anyone" in fact, want to say "love your invaders/colonials."
It is possible to continue the origin and motivation of the structures such as Hülasa, FETÖ or Tahir-ül Kadri to the Kadıyni, and all of these organizations are actually supported as a matuf to expose societies in order to pass imperialism and serve colonialism.
"last desire" came out of the cargo
Emily Pomeranz (50), who spent her last days in a hospital in Washington due to pancreatic cancer, expressed her longing for a coffee and chocolate-mixed milkshake (milk drink) of a restaurant in her town.
A friend of her contacts the owner of a restaurant called Tommy's.
Tommy Fello, who has been running the same restaurant for 47 years, put the drink on dry ice and paid the fee of 123 dollars (435 TL) and sent it to the hospital 600 kilometers away with the "fast delivery" cargo.
Two new projects by Ahmet Kul
Ahmet Kul İnşaat, which has implemented important projects such as Lavinya Park, Otoport, Vetro City and Ginza Lavinya Park, has put Dia Mare in Istanbul Mimaroba and Solse 7 projects in Bodrum Yalikavak.
The geometry of the Dia Mare project, developed by its architecture Çamoğlu Architecture, was developed to get the maximum benefit from the sea.
Located on an area of 11 thousand square meters, Dia Mare has a total of 188 houses and 17 commercial units.
The project, which has a rough structure, will be delivered to its new owners in March 2018.
Dia Mare has a large number of flat types ranging from 2+1 to 5+1.
The company, which will commission two new construction sites in Mimaroba and Bitez within this year, is preparing to sign 2 major projects in Topkapı in 2018.
Concisely transferred 753 million to companies
Barış Yarkadaş said that many programs were made outside on TRT where 6,760 personnel worked and that herpes prices were paid.
"In TRT 2016, the taxation of the people was again attracted to AKP companies."
"This is called robbery," he said.
The source transferred by TRT to the supporting production companies was revealed with the data obtained from the official documents.
The official response to the application made by CHP Istanbul Deputy Barış Yarkadaş within the framework of the Information Acquisition Law revealed how TRT's resources were spent.
Yarkadaş said that despite all kinds of technical facilities, in TRT, where 6,760 people work as staffed, 753 million 500 thousand TL was transferred to the supportive companies in 2016 through the programs built under the name of external production.
"The meaning of this is profit," said the deputy of the CHP.
Barış Yarkadaş, "The production companies of journalists and businessmen from the AKP are looting TRT."
"Millions are paid for productions that are not seen or withdrawn."
Reminding companies that the money transferred was collected from the taxes of the people, Yarkadaş said, "The institution with 7,000 personnel has returned to the AKP's barley."
"What programs have these companies have signed and received this money, which 7,000 people couldn't do," he said.
Explaining that TRT's advertising revenue in 2016 is 224.456.182 TL, Yarkadaş stated that the advertising income remains as an ear when the staff salaries and other expenses are taken into account.
" TRT, which has become the voice of the AKP, cannot get advertising because it is not being watched."
Feeding journalists receive money from TRT, screaming for AKP.
"Peace is pulling the load," he said.
"TRT pays 660 million TL annually to personnel, but it gives all the work to foreign productions."
From the pockets of the people, 753.5 trillion were attracted to peasants.

Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
Bank of England is expected to announce soon that interest rates will not change, after slow economic growth and reduced speculation that inflation will be increased.
With the narrowing of family income, the Bank of England warned that economic growth will continue "slow" as they keep their interest rates stable.
The decision-makers of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 votes to keep interest rates by 0.25%, thus demanding a lesser increase this month after slow economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In the three-month inflation report, the Bank has raised growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and has warned that household revenues will continue to shrink, with inflation still expected to rise close to 3% in the spring.
However, interest increases signalled that Brexit's inflation in the next few years is necessary to rein, and said borrowing costs may have to increase more than expected in the financial markets.
The members also voted to withdraw part of the gigantic economy healing package launched a year ago, following Brexit.
Starting next February, the Bank said it would end the Term Funding Plan, which offers cheap financing to banks, but expects it to offer $15 billion more (total 115 billion euros) under the plan.
"The central estimate of the central estimate of the GDP continues slow in the short term as the narrowing of domestic real incomes continues to be a burden on consumption," the Bank said minutes after the interest decision was made.
Regarding interest, he stressed that "a little bit of contraction in monetary policy" may be necessary to alleviate inflation, and that it will be "someer higher" than the market expects.
Markets still estimate that the first increase will be in the third quarter of next year and that someone else will be in 2020.
But the bank stresses that any increase will be "step-by-step" and "limb."
According to estimates in May, the bank's reductiond growth forecasts for this year's and next year are compared to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The Bank maintains its estimate of 1.8% in 2018.
The pound lost value in the face of the dollar and the euro after the news.
The Pound fell by 0.5%, falling by 1.31 dollars and 0.4%, falling by 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change came after GDP mitigates expectations for growing growth rates, which are disappointing, with 0.2% in the previous three months compared to 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth will probably remain 0.3% in the third quarter, but it will begin to increase slightly by the end of the year, compared to the bank.
While the bank says the contraction will get worse before it improves, the latest inflation report leaves little joy to households hit by increased inflation and small salaries.
The bank said the monetary policy would not "engage" the shooting of revenues over the next few years, but expects the salaries to improve "importantly" towards the end of their three-year forecast.
The increase in demand for British goods as a result of weak pounds will support the economy by balancing some of the declining consumer expenditures.
The decision came a year after the shocked EU referendum vote, which took the pound down, fell to 0.25% last August.
The Bank estimates that this will likely take four years for it to have a full impact on prices and the economy.
Prior to the bank's latest interest decision, there was an increase in inflation pressure on difficult households and a rising demand for an increase in interest rate increase by three policy makers to increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation declined from 2.9% in July to 2.6% last month, but the bank said it was expected and will increase once again in the coming months.
According to their 2% target, the bank said the vaccine was "completely" with the weaker pounds.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Considering the recent declines in trading rates, the mortgage market will become even more competitive once again, while lenders are in demand of business and a positive closure of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who are nearing the end of their current contracts, with many free options and low interest rates, becoming even more popular than ever," he said.
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV medication to 10,000 people
At the Supreme Court, after a struggle for the financing of the drug in the NHS, patients will be able to access the 'converting' HIV prevention treatment from September.
The NHS UK announced that pre-extension prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken prior to sex, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by around 86 per cent in high-risk people, will be provided by health services to approximately 10,000 people through a 3-year preliminary trial.
The Supreme Court's decision last year agreed to finance the experiment after the Appeals Court approved it. The resolution said the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP, despite allegations of financing by local authorities.
This move, announced on Thursday, was met by Simon Stevens, president of the NHS Britain, as a 'new and serious intervention', while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'turn point'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to record the public, with the participation of more clinics in October, the UK will be fully implemented throughout the UK by April 2018.
Pre-expse prophylaxis (PrEP) is a number of HIV drugs that reduce the risk of HIV before sex.
The trials showed that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transfer among those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means that a person's body is sufficiently found in medicines that will prevent HIV infection from being established.
Such drugs can be taken up to two hours before each day or without sex.
Those who are suitable for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and HIV-positive partners who are unable to be successfully treated.
Clinics will identify suitable participants who will consent to the experiment from men, women, transgender individuals and unprecedented persons whose partner's HIV status is controlled by an anti-retroviral treatment.
People living in the UK and registered with a general practitioner will also be able to register for potential participation in participating local sexual health clinics.
The program will hold $10 million and the NHS signed an agreement to provide medicines this week with a UK international bid.
The trial was designed to assess the exact potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence as to how PrEP is targeted, executed and applied on a large scale.
"This new and serious intervention will contribute to broad and increasing successful efforts in preventing HIV," said Mr. Stevens.
This is another milestone in the thirty-year development in humanity's important health problems.'
Deborah Gold, president of NAT (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
If the PrEP is targeted correctly for those who need it and those at risk, the PrEP offers the possibility of transforming the HIV outbreak in the UK.
As of September, people with high HIV risk will reach a new and powerful vehicle that is truly personalized and not open to negotiation with a partner through this experiment funded by the NHS in the UK, which will lead to the recovery of many lives.
We welcome this announcement warmly.'
Ian Green, president of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority should be to ensure that the experiment is now being presented nationwide quickly and that no one with HIV risk is left behind.
Since the PrEP experimental drug is now available, we are on the right track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV.'
Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'We welcome the start of the PrEP experiment, and months of delays and then the government's strife.
Evidence shows how this drug can be transformative as part of our view of the prevention of HIV and in ending the transmission of this life-changing infection
The experiment will bring us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP altogether.
It is now important that this experiment protects those exposed to HIV and is presented as quickly as possible across the country to bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.

Two secrets deaths
Ümit Makbule Çilingiroğlu (51), the daughter of former Minister of Industry and Trade Ayhan Çilingiroğlu, D.C., fell down from the 19th floor of a business center that was also used as a hotel in Istanbul Levent.
Koç University student, 24-year-old Melis Salihoğlu, was also found dead in his home.
It was claimed that Salihoğlu hanged himself.
Two consecutive secrets, considered suicide by police, have been investigated.
'DEPRESİF HALİ VARDI'
Ümit Makbule Çililingiroğlu, the daughter of Ayhan Çilingiroğlu, Turkey's first Minister of Industry and Trade, who served in the government of Nihat Erim in 1971, entered the Le Meridien Hotel in Etiler at 17.00 on August 1st.
An ambulance and police team were called to the scene after a Kuwaiti tourist who settled in the 19th-floor room and saw the lifeless body of Çilingiroğlu, who had been not heard from for a while, informed the hotel management.
The medical team determined that Çilingiroğlu, who fell from the 19th floor to the hard ground, had lost his life.
"He had a depressing state recently," said Mediha Çilingiroğlu, the mother who testified to the police.
He arrived from Ankara to Istanbul on 31 July.
I have a grandson with leukemia from my other daughter.
"This was interested in my grandson and was negatively affected by my grandson's illness," he said.
Çilingiroğlu, whose funeral was abolished to the Forensic Medicine Institution, is expected to be buried in Ankara.
It's being investigated whether Çilingiroğlu was thrown out by someone or committing suicide.
'CANINA KIYDI' CLAIM
The other suspected death in Istanbul occurred in Sarıyer Zekeriyaköy.
Melis Salihoğlu (24) who studied at Koç University was found dead in her home.
The young girl's father allegedly went to his daughter's house near school, where she could not hear from her cell phone.
The father encountered his daughter's lifeless body at home.
It was claimed that Melis, who was loved by her family, close circle and friends, hung herself at her home and ended her life.
Melis Salihoğlu's death was overwhelmed by the law on his family and relatives.
After Melis, a friend of mine said on social media, "A sparkly sun hits our faces."
We were in a good mood when we were chasing that little plastic ball with your lush grass under our feet, your best friend Jack and your sister Eyşan.
He shared the message, "What was the reason for dying now."
To live a luxurious life: Asma kat and smart design numbers have transformed this little Earls Courts apartment into a spacious home.
In 2014, Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate renovations, went from a large house in Knightsbridge to the apartment at Earls Court to shrink.
It's on the first floor of a fancy Queen Anne-style comb, and a new design that Joanne's convinced of her luggage is convinced of without picking up her luggage.
"Before that, I lived in a much bigger area with my ex in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something equal to my price.
I was shown the apartment at Earl Court, and they had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with him and I gave him an offer that day."
After the first sight, the 1000 ft squared circle was completely renewed.
Initially, it was a one-room and complexly planned property; you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom. Joanne wanted to add a storage space and a mezzanine floor to maximize the peak of the generous ceiling.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows and a lot of light.
It was my condition," he says.
For this purpose, Notting Hill based architecture and design studio, Duck & Shed, hired Erfan Azadi from the 12.5 ft ceiling and not only to create a building but also a place where Joanne would live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two consecutive spaces, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine floor in which you could stand in it.
Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the matter.
"The steel skeleton is quite complex," he explains.
"We had to set the blanks so that they could be piled up without the need to bow down on each other.
This was not only to build a simple platform, but the steels would bend so that they would be at the right height according to the function at the top or bottom."
This arrangement brought many additional dramas to enable Erfan to get two full-sized rooms on each other.
The old type of copper light window from Retrouvius for mezzanine floor looks at the magnificent living area below.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver highlights, and the old type of Serge Mouille all determines the style of the design.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of space, space and light.
The mirrors placed on both ends of the short aisle make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored ranger panel gives the feeling of a window opening to another room.
The light units at the morgue provide Joanne's entire cutlery and storage space for all of Joanne's glassware.
The beauty of the living room, which creates a more magnificent perception of space, is to be able to close the kitchen when it is not in use.
The doors are not new.
The original one is that it is a garage-style door that can be lifted up.
"We used some engineering in this," Erfan explains the steel-retardant polished MDF door.
"It has a balance weight, so it's really easy to slip when you push the door up."
With the intelligent use of the area and storage space, Joanne has won an additional 16 square meters, an extra bedroom and an improved session plan.
"At the end of the day, there's something you're going to sell, or the value of your property is determined," says Erfan.
"As a DECI, a realtor will go in and make a calculation based on a residence area."
Here, while increasing the floor area, they managed to use quality material that gives the area the luxurious look.
"Materials are objects that you touch, and thus help you build emotional bonds at home," Erfan says.
"At home, you don't fall in love with the power lines on the wall.
These are important, but they don't shake the strings of your heart."
This proves that a circle can turn into something quite amazing from a standard thing through good design and increased square meter.
Actually, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.
Jeremain Lens in Beşiktaş with its bonservi
At the end of the 1.5-month negotiations, he was transferred to Beşiktaş with the Lens bonservi, which was originally considered to be a rental.
After talks over the past week, Lens has signed with the Black and white team for a fee of 5m euros.
The Dutch player, who had a five-year deal, was learned to receive 2.2m euros annually.
Beşiktaş is expected to make an official statement regarding the transfer of Jeremain Lens.
Wedding photos of famous couples
The model Çağla Şikel and actress Emre Altuğ, who had been in a bumpy relationship for about 4 years, entered the world house in Sortie.
The couple immortalized the wedding ceremony, which they called "it was the most special moment of our lives," with the photograph taken.
Seven years later, the couple decided to break up.
Brothers fighting over $500 million estate empire
The two brothers are at war for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, with more than $500 million in value, 40 years after the dynasty built by the Italian families.
Colin De Lutis, director and contractor of the former Carlton Football Club, lives three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who gave him to the Supreme Court on how to share property and business assets in Toorak.
Paul wanted to quit the family business since 2014, but there was a fierce debate in the Supreme Court about the disintegration.
With their mother Anna, the brothers and sisters are the owners of 38 properties, which have been accumulated since a shop in Collingwood, Collingwood, which has been accumulated in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and raised him to a chain with 160 retail stores.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in the property, and De Lutis's portfolio currently includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento contracting sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments and suburban shopping centers.
Under an agreement with their deceased father, Colin (described by Paul as "a significant propulsion and dominant personality" in the De Lutis family) has two-thirds of the company's assets and one-third of Paul's assets.
A court-martial says this means that Colin owns $316 million and Paul has $176 million.
Diving property and cash for Paul comes into being a controversial issue.
In his first affidavit to the court in 2015, he wrote: "The divisions proposed by Colin were leaving him with the properties that I always thought was the best of them."
The first Supreme Court hearing was held last Friday, after several failed mediation.
The brothers are also in a quarrel over who will control the current job; Paul claims that Colin has left him out of the business.
Colin argues that it's not true, but he accuses Paul of managing some property incompetently.
Colin, in his initial sworn statement, says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots dictate to me that family is the most important priority." written in the form.
The costs in the case are increasing along with hundreds of pages of sworn statements, emails recorded by companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and top lawyers such as Allan Myers, QC, and senior legal advisors held by both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were an Italian immigrant family who ran groceries and delicacies from the late 1950s, and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They pawned Colin's property to buy Collingwood property where his family opened his first jeans shop.
Colin says that "in my last years in the school, when Paul was a little boy (10 years old) he founded Westco there.
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hopes to leave her property friendly to her sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court."
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group; Colin said that Mark was paid $10 million when he quit, and Luke was paid $26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "unsatisfied with the conditions of their financial separation."
According to the 2015 biography of Eddi McGuire, the best friend of the television star, Colin tried to avoid attention, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL club.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and his lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin responded by text message, saying, "I can't say much too much" because the case was in court.
"It must have been very, very sad that my brother Paul chose to sue me and drag our family's name to courts."
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court application that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't want Paul and I to settle in the current dispute," he said, adding that he is "almost hopeful about the solution."
On Friday, this hope seems to be lost.
"Our problem will be solved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do that.
If that happens, it's the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief will restrict the flow of information (including news media reports) to President Trump in the hope of keeping the boss more stable.
Some minor information from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"The White House's new chief of staff, John F. When Kelly met with senior staff on her first day at work, she summarized a fundamental problem that President Donald Trump plans to solve the White House: the fall of bad information into the president's hands.
Kelly told the staff that information, whether on paper or with briefings, should flow through him, because the president could make better decisions when good information was given.
Kelly's diagnosis sounds very meaningful, but others tried to subsistify Trump by overseeing the media diet, and they failed.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and he's still in the White House, and he's still in good shape to watch TV.
"If candidate Trump was upset that he was not in the media fairly, it was a yield booster to show him found a fair place in convincing media outlets," said Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
"According to six campaign officials, the key to controlling Trump's Twitter habit was to ensure that personal media consumption contained a steady flow of praise," Politico wrote.
I'll do it.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit is "under control" at any time is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't know, like Trump's tweets would be much more provocative if they didn't have their own intervention.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets Trump hasn't sent.
If his employees were able to get him out of danger even a few times, then his efforts were valuable.
But no one could prevent Trump from constantly creating controversy.
Part of the problem was that the White House was made up of the factions competing with each other, that is, in any case, trying to advance their own agendas with the materials they presented to Trump (which could be reliable or unreliable) and those who highlighted their worldviews.
In May, Politico reported the whole story, advisors strategically inclined to deliver suspicious information to the president.
An example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher in detail was:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump reacted violently from the press to negative clippings, especially the leaks that had a bad effect, and that he was caught up in finding out where they originated.
At the end of February, someone's president, internet provocateur Charles C. This was the same when Johnson's website gave a printed copy of an article on GotNews.com, accusing Katie Walsh of being the "source behind a series of leaks" in the White House.
It was not important that Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he had submitted any concrete evidence, or that he had filed false accusations in the past and returned from them.
Trump read the article and began asking the staff questions about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the chief of staff at the time, Reince Priebus and White House personnel secretary Rob Porter, "trying to place a system that handles and certifies the documents that Trump received."
How did that turn out?
Kelly's trying to do the same thing three months later.
Maybe it will appear as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still in his own impulsive form and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors will make Kelly's job very difficult.
Crypto FETÖ's reveals with a special template
Izmir Public Prosecutor Berkant Karakaya completed the investigation initiated by the secret witness codenamed "Sarmaşık" within the scope of the investigation into the leak of irregularities in the "military espionage investigation" and the leak of certain information.
The study stressed that Rear Admiral Yaycı was not a member of the organization, but that he helped the investigator in deciphering members of the Turkish Naval Forces Command and played an active role in the fight against FETÖ.
The decision pointed out that Sagittarius attempted a coup on 15 July, in accordance with the so-called martial law order, he was tried to be pacified by the Naval Forces Command and tried to be pacified, underlining that he had fought effectively against FETÖ since the first day of the coup attempt.
In the decision made by Karakaya, the following statements were used: "It was understood that the Yaycı was working on the determination of the personnel of the Turkish Naval Forces Command thanks to the special system created over the specific template for the determination of FETÖ members of the crypto privacy services class and the special system created over 209 sub-criteria with 64 basic criteria."
It has been concluded that it is not possible to value a forecast-based assessment of Yaycı, which is known to be an active anti-terrorist organization as a result of the struggle that is known as an active terrorist organization and has a great contribution in this direction, is not acceptable to be valued by our public prosecutor.
The Rear Admiral Sagittarius had previously been charged with defamation.
It was also revealed that the FETÖists were behind it, and the alleged crime was a conspiracy.
Former Air Pilot Staff Colonel Hakan Dinç, who complained that Yaycı insulted him, turned the complaint in the form of information note into a document former Adana Incirlik 10.
Tanker Base Commander Air Pilot Brigadier General Bekir Ercan Van, former Chief of General Staff's Chief of Staff's Judicial Counsellor Colonel Muharrem Köse, former Chief of General Staff Intelligence Head of Intelligence Lieutenant General Mustafa Özsoy, former Judge Major Erkan Ağn, former Deniz Captain Necmettin Aksoy, former Chief of Staff, former Judge Commander Serdar Çamiçi and former Staff Colonel Mustafa Çiçek, who made the trial, made the trial as a witness against former Chief of Staff Serdar Çamiçi and Yaycı, it was exported from the Turkish Armed Forces due to its connections with FETÖ.
Some members of the organization, including Tuncay Opçin, the FETÖ escape, were targeting Yaycı with their posts on social media before and after the July 15 coup attempt.
Travelers overthrown the moat, return to the 'rich neighborhood'
Some of the richest hosts of the West Midlands are fighting again with the determined travellers who have crossed the trench dug by the council to reclaim the area outside their own mansions.
The travelers parked 20 caravans outside an area called the 'richler neighborhood', which was the middle of Solihull's in place.
They returned after they were fired by bringing horses, babies and a lot of wagons from the ditch dug to cut off their raids.
The intelligently moving group found a gap in the defense, leaking their vehicles in by setting a path from a partition left without a barricade.
Angry residents criticised the Solihull Council, saying it was "usable for the solution of the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "After they were sent from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by, they came there on Monday evening.
He should be ashamed of the council movements because they're useless to solve the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were sent, and now they're back.
There were more coming last night, and there's probably more to come today."
He added: 'Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this with the long suspension decisions taken to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Street, and I'm not happy to continue to pay my taxes when the council can't even stop it.'
A resident of the area who did not want to give his name said: "Like a joke, we saw that the last group of travelers had just left, and we were immediately devastated by a new group.
Their numbers had increased this time, and they were even seen grazing in a horse's parking lot.'
A spokesman from the Solihull Council said: "We are aware that there is an unauthorized camp on the property of Stetsbrook Street, we are starting the legal procedures necessary to send them there as soon as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important for as many residents as possible to call 101 and report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police.
This will help the publicity of the court to take into account the court when we present our case to the court.'

Skyscrapers with a land wall with sea do not breathe
"The expert report in the case clearly says that these structures will not withstand an earthquake of 6 magnitude," Parliamentary Member Nadir Ataman of the CHP warned about the rising giant structures on the coast.
It is noted that the stakes, where the sturdy rock is 25-30 meters below, are not excavated so deep.
Istanbul Ataköy left the district breathless high-rise hotels and residences that walled between the sea and land on the coast.
Bakirkoy Municipality Assembly Member Nadir Ataman from CHP reacted to giant shopping malls, hotels and residence projects rising one after another in the district.
Ataman pointed out that the buildings on the beach cut the wind, "80 years ago, those who planned according to the wind formed the Atatürk Forest in Florya.
As far as the concept of urbanism was reached 80 years later, they planted giant skyscrapers in the wind corridors and changed the climate.
"There's no breathing in the precinct," he said.
Ataman stated that the buildings rising like a wall on the coast of Ataköy changed the balance of the climate. "The temperature is felt 10 degrees more because of the skyscrapers."
These buildings need to be built in the direction of the winds.
But our skyscrapers are rising above the wind corridors of Istanbul.
The wind can't get into the county.
These structures destabilize the balance of natural life.
Ataman stated that these skyscrapers, which harm the environment and human health, also cut off the connection of the people of Bakırköy with the sea, and said that they would apply to the Board of Monuments on the subject and go to the judiciary.
Non-surgical treatment is possible for hair rotation.
In cases where Fenol is applied, success is seen to be up to 83 percent.
In this method, the diseased tissue is effectively cleaned and the tissue cavity is filled with an agent that kills the hair roots.
Another of the non-surgical hair spin treatment techniques is the laser method.
With various lasers, the hair roots and the surrounding tissue are burned thanks to circularly emitted rays and the tissues are ensured to close by sticking during this combustion.
Thanks to these two non-surgical methods of hair spiny disease, patients can return to social and business life in a shorter time.
Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. stated that overweight, sedentary life, long-term sitting work, intensive hair and body hair and not following hygiene rules cause hair to return hair. Mert Atak indicated that among the symptoms of the disease, there were pains in the coccyx, infection, abscess and swelling.
Italy hardens NGOs approach to migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue if they do not comply with the new rules that affect their operations.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new charter, it will be difficult to see that they continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti told the Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after the Italian authorities were confiscated on suspicion of effective co-operation with human traffickers, a boat operated by the German aid agency Jugend Rettet, in a way that facilitates illegal migration.
The charity, which has been active for only one year, has refused to comment on the contents of the detailed accusations against them by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is our most important priority, and so we are very sorry that we can't work in the search and rescue zone right now," the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only evaluate the charges that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and can evaluate the situation."
Italian authorities have been watching Jugend Rettet's boat, Iuventa since October.
The crew is suspected to have taken rubber boats full of migrants directly delivered to them by human traffickers and allow smugglers to flee by boats for reuse.
According to the file filed by the Italian media, at least such a single meeting took place, allegedly taking place 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya.
The crew is under suspicion of disregarding the authority of the Italian coast guard, which has oversee rescue operations in the region due to humanitarian efforts rather than another purpose.
According to the statute, boats such as Iuventa were supposed to be an Italian police officer on board, who clearly monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the bylaws: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The last one said on Tuesday that the new rules were unnecessary but acceptable because it would not cause any "serious changes or obstacles" in their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign are the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti, meanwhile, said the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following the rescues in the past weeks, efforts to strengthen Libyan coastline security and co-operation with local governors are fruiting.
"We've been seeing the light at the end of the tunnel lately," he said.
This month, Libyan governors announced their plans to conduct more talks on economic development initiatives and to take measures to reduce the number of migrants who left Chad, Niger and Mali and the hope of reaching Europe.
Last minute punch!
In Moscow, the capital of Russia, watermelon was eaten as every year during the celebrations of the "parachute troops day" was drunk.
He attacked Russian NTV television reporter Nikita Razvozjayev, who was broadcasting live in a Russian Gorky Park, who attended the event and had been over-cost.
"Please shut up," the reporter told the man who said, "Please shut up," who said, "We're going to hold out Ukraine."
The drunken man, who was reported to be an ex-paratrooper, punched him hard at the reporter's warning.
The reporter, stunned by the blow, tried to get away from the man.
Millions of people watched the shock on the air.
Economic Coordination Board convened
The Economic Coordination Board (EKK) met under the chairmanship of Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek in charge of the economy.
After the cabinet change in the government, the EKK meeting, which was held for the first time under the presidency of Şimşek, started at 18.30 at Çankaya Mansion.
Turkey's macroeconomic appearance will be discussed at the meeting.
The meeting, chaired by Şimşek, was attended by Minister of Finance Naci Ağbal, Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü, Minister of Labour and Social Security Jülide Sarıeroğlu, Minister of Customs and Trade Bülent Tüfenkci, Minister of Development Lütfi Elvan, Undersecretary of Treasury Osman Çelik, Central Bank President Murat Çetinkaya and related bureaucrats.
It is possible to get rid of lumbar hernia in 45 minutes
Noting that only 5 percent of patients should be operated in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation, Assoc. Dr. "According to the patient's examination and imaging results, the first step is rest and drug therapy," says Oğuz Karaeminoğulları.
Oğuz Karaeminoğulları, who stated that interventional methods (such as epidural injection, radiofrequency techniques, intra-disc interventions) should be tried in the patient group where the pains continue, warn that "If success is not achieved from all these methods, if the drowsiness and weakness in the legs are becoming apparent, then surgery becomes mandatory."
Karaeminoğulları stated that 'full closed hernia surgery', which minimizes the risk today, also allows patients who cannot get results with interventional methods, their reviews on surgery can also decrease, and he explains that it is possible to get rid of hernia disease in 45 minutes:
Although microscopic surgery has very good results compared to open surgery, there may be some complications such as long recovery period, spinal convulsions, hernia recurrence and future lumbar shift and infection.
Microscopic surgery is often defined as 'closed surgery', but microscopic surgery is performed with the same approach as open surgery.
In full closed hernia surgery, these risks disappear because the surrounding tissues are protected.
Full closed hernia surgery lasts only 45 minutes.
Special commission at work
The commission will include CHP MPs Mehmet Gökdağ, Cemal Okan Yüksel, Barış Yarkadaş and Higher Disciplinary Board Member Turan Aydoğan.
Commission, Berberoğlu's Istanbul on 4 October 14.
He will follow his hearing at the High Criminal Court and the applications to the Constitutional Court and the Regional Court of Appeal.
"The independence and impartiality of the judiciary is the indispensable condition of justice, not taking orders from anywhere but the law," CHP Secretary General Kamil Okyay Sındır and Vice-President Bülent Tezcan's signature.
"Our deputy, Mr. Enis Berberoğlu, did not request any special status while serving as a member of parliament, did not take refuge in the immunity armor recognized by the MP, and wanted to protect his faith in the independent and impartiality of the judiciary."
It has been suggested that the trial process prefers to impose political orders rather than conduct proceedings.
The article argued that despite the Constitutional Court's decisions misconduct on the arrest of lawmakers, the decision to arrest it was unconfirmated was clear evidence that the court had taken an influence.
Michelle Carter sentenced for messages that encouraged Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20 years old, has a 15-month portion of her sentence behind bars and will be freed for five years.
In June, Carter was convicted of the insolence murder of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Mr. Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to be released with open appeal.
Although he faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, his legal team argued that he and Mr. Roy suffered from mental illness.
Wearing a red pants and a cream blouse, Carter was punished with old eyes, with his hands held together and eyes on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
He ended his life to heal his own.
He did not accept responsibility," he said.
"He never showed that he regretted it."
But Carter's lawyer said, "It was a terrible situation where he completely regretted."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not see that he "has had any significant impact on the actions of the age, even mental illness."
A prosecutor read Mr. Roy's mother Lynn Roy's statement: "One day there is no mourning for the loss of my dear son.
I want him to be proud of how I and I got through everything. I am trying to be with his sisters with all the pain we will bear forever."
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that he would never attend his brother's wedding, or that he would never have been to his children, "doublely" was "unblemp."
"The fact that the person you've been with every day since I was born is no longer a pain that will always be with me for the rest of my life."
Since there is no Massachusetts law that blames telling a person to commit suicide, the case seems to be a cause of jurisprudence.
Carter was 17 years old when Mr. Roy was found dead in a vehicle for carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.
The case attracted national attention when it came to find out that Carter's text messages encouraged him to end his own life.
While he was on vacation with his family, the girl sent a lot of messages he sent two weeks before her death said, "Ask yourself, jump from a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there's a lot of roads."
In the moments before his suicide, he wrote, "You must do this, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz ordered that he not be allowed to profit from this case through the press, saying Carter wanted to attract attention through the death of Mr. Roy.
The case has divided the legal opinions.
Among the minority defending Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being exonerated two years ago.
Ms. Knox (30) published an article in the Los Angeles Times saying: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not imprisonment."
Stunning growth forecast from Mehmet Şimşek
Inflation in Turkey should be reduced to low single-digit figures, Şimşek said, adding that food inflation constitutes a "risk area".
Inflation will drop below 7 per cent in 2018, the Deputy Prime Minister predicts.
In his lightning speech, he said:
The next 12 months are critical in decreasing uncertainties.
The greatest incentive is to reduce uncertainties.
There's a strong government.
No political uncertainty.
I hope the uncertainties in our near geography also decrease.
By increasing our resistance to shocks with some reform, I believe that we put Turkey on a growth trend of more than 5 percent.
I told you months ago.
Because the worst is over.
Gradually, we are no longer in those areas, but for reforms that will provide inclusive growth of our energy, which will increase employment...
So the next 12 months are critical.
On the one hand, reform, on the other hand, there is no political uncertainty, on the other hand, there is no political uncertainty.
Hopefully, our luck will go away and the troubles in our near geography will decrease.
Whether we like it or not, many of our classic markets are collapsed.
Libya, like Iraq.
We're not just losing Sunday, we're dealing with over 3.5 million migration waves.
When we look at the last 15 years, Turkey has grown by 5.7 percent despite all these shocks.
Turkey, that is, we have solid problems with our foundations.
Now, by increasing our resistance to shocks with some reforms, we will put more questions on investors' minds and put Turkey back into a growth policy of over 5 percent.
Let me be clear, I've got that generous retirement system from here.
I think it would be reasonable if I told you that our pension companies weren't making enough effort.
Once the performance in auto participation will be strong.
Why? Why?
Because we've taken precautions.
Companies don't have to go and make an effort and spend it.
By considering these concerns, taking into account the poor performance, we worked on how to allocate global assets to what investment areas.
In the deposit, you know, the returns are high.
Once a clear, there will be a performance there, in addition to 25 percent of the state's provision.
The rest of the plus is usually low on the treasury papers, and there's a low risk.
When we look at the big picture, I think the interest will increase in the coming period.
Because they'll see the performance.
It's not a failure in the other area, it's a success.
We restructured BES in 2013.
There are 6.8 million participants, there is a saving of 70 billion liras.
Give me that the system is successful.
There are 2.6 million participants in automatic participation and 775 million pounds of savings.
We're asking more companies for an effort.
Let them advertise a little, tell them about this system.
We're working on the withdrawal.
Maybe if we stretched him out...
We'll see, we're working.
Maybe the citizens will see the yield and see the accumulation and stay in the system.
38 percent out of the system.
Almost half of the breakups are voluntary individual pensioners.
You don't want two individual pension accounts.
Hey, what are you doing?
You're leaving auto.
In fact, we were expecting a withdrawal around 10 percent.
So we were very optimistic there.
Once the system works.
We brought a prime ceiling.
Insurance companies explain it sometimes.
They've increased their premiums very quickly.
When we asked what's going on, they said judicial decisions don't take into account the current regulations.
We've made a new arrangement.
We thought you'd do what you had to do.
They said no, let's wait for judgment.
And we said that's not how it works.
We're having a difference of opinion here.
Of course, when this ceiling went into premium application, some companies refused.
We've made a new arrangement.
We've created a risky insurer pool.
Let me tell you this, I'll repeat it.
I prefer this system to work through competition.
So I don't think these ceiling price applications are right, they forced us to.
I'd like to take a three-dimensional look at this.
Let the system we do take into account.
Two, let the system function normally, a price on that path.
In addition to him, the loads are heavy, almost 30-31 liras of every 100 lira premium paid goes to tax SSI deductions.
I'm working on it, and we're gonna talk to our finance minister.
Third, technology is evolving rapidly.
Now, over time, traffic accidents will also be severely reduced structurally.
But it's mandatory traffic insurance.
SABAH's headline saved his leg
Buerger's disease, which has emerged since adolescence, was a disease that used to be seen in men, but today it has also become common in women.
One of these women is Mehtap Dursun, 36 years old.
His pains, which started two years ago, became chronic on the sole of the feet.
When the young woman, who had difficulty walking, was at risk of losing her leg, the hospital went around the hospital.
A friend of his, Prof. Dr. Yusuf recommended Kalko.
The headline in SABAH showed the news that "Azerbaijan saved the life of the Minister of Emergency."
It was revealed that Dursun, who went to Kalko, struggled with Buerger's disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko has the young woman in surgery.
Dursun, who soon recovered from his pain, is now receiving oxygen therapy.
Audi 850,000 Diesel Vehicles Will Modify While Car Manufacturers Against Reverse Reaction
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW's chairman said he believes that the company "is more intelligent options than the drive limitations," referring to European cities, including Munich, the central BMW (which is considered to be banned or restricted of special vehicles).
On Tuesday, Daimler said three million Mercedes cars in Europe would be modified to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the firms described these moves as recall.
European car manufacturers had intensively encouraged the use of diesel vehicles to help meet carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States.
But the nitrogen oxides released by diesel engines are considered cancer-making and can cause asthma.
The cost of the equipment that automotive companies need to install to neutralize the dirty smoke generated by diesel vehicles is also increasing and making it difficult for cars to keep the price competitive.
While German automakers were facing reviews, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government was accused of pampering powerful automobile companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's errors, which hides the device known as the misleading device and adjusting emissions to suit regulations at the time of the test of an automobile, relaxing it under normal driving conditions.
Many Volkswagen executives have been accused in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany in Audi's engine development department.
Former director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian and therefore is not protected against extradition and may be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was dragged into a German criminal investigation, including Volkswagen, and the authorities had expanded the United States-based investigation after accusing Audi of installing a system to get rid of emission rules in Europe.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may be heavy on Volkswagen: the luxury car maker has an excessive share in the profits of Volkswagen.
Fishing jumps to every time you see
Turkish Neurosurgical Association President Prof. Dr. Yusuf Şükrü Çağlar, whose depth was not sure, warned not to jump from 2 meters to shallow places.
Every year, thousands of people are at risk of paralysis due to diffusing neck and spinal cord damage due to dive into shallow waters.
Neck fractures most often develop in the 5th or 6th vertebrae.
The characteristic of the fractures at this level is that it affects the nerves that nourish the respiratory muscles as well as the muscles of the arms.
Prof. Dr. "The spinal area, which is our most valuable organ in such accidents, is cut or disfiscated by the spine broken by broken due to fracture."
"The wrong first aid in spinal cord injuries can not only increase the damage to the survivors, but it can cause death."
Fishing in the water ranks fourth in spinal cord injuries.
The mean age of the injured is 20-29 and the majority is male.
Prof. Dr. "The water that cannot be seen should not be skid."
"No matter how well he dive, there may be a serious injury."
Prof. Dr. The ages also reminded:
A different degree of paralysis may occur in the arms and legs depending on the spinal cord level where the damage caused the injury during fishing.
You may know how to swim, but the water can be deceptive.
The place that looks deep to you can be shallow.
Warning signs placed on the seashore in the United States and Australia showed a 70 percent reduction in case of fishing in shallow water.
Prof. Dr. "Although there are 28 provinces in Turkey on the seaside, unfortunately there is not a single warning sign in the places outside Istanbul."
"In relation to such accidents that make life dark, information light or information boards on the beaches and pools under the health directorate, schools and social awareness project of each province should be kept in a remarkable way."
TURK Neurosurgery Association Spinal and Peripheral Nerve Surgery Group President Prof. Dr. Kadir Kotil suggested that in the event of injury, he should be:
At the time of the incident, 112 should be searched for first thing.
The neck should be kept as stable as possible, should not be moved, detected with a hard collar.
Airway should be provided and the patient should be tilted back to the wrong side for the drainage of water that escapes to the lung.
It shouldn't be sagging to the legs and drain the water.
The deformation of the patient's neck should not be tried to be corrected.
The cervical vertebrae could have been broken.
However, if the spinal cord has not yet been damaged, an inappropriate position to be given to the neck during the first aid and the treatment of the patient may cause broken bone fragments to press the spinal cord and cut and damage.
Provence lavender under threat of climate change
It was a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, which causes a major headache to scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years, the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change that brings rain, much less in the spring and mostly in autumn.
This affects the life of the lavender.
There is also a small cicane, a leaf pest that transfers microbacterial, and it happens a lot more than them in very dry weather."
And a lot of things are in danger.
It is very much for lavender oil for perfume and cosmetics as well as holidaymakers.
Eric Chaisse said: "We have smaller, underdeveloped or weak spikes, or weak, with a few wide flowers, too long.
So we have less essential oily parts."
The solutions are reviewed include better water dissipation and slowing down soil vaporization, but spraying a mixture of slime and water that protects plants and developing more resistant species to dry conditions.
Journalist murder underlines growing threat in Mexico
The weekly newspaper Riodoce's staff usually meets on Wednesdays to review the latest turmoil, corrupt officers and unending drug wars in the state of Sinaloa, to review the plans for the newspaper.
But on this day, they came together to discuss their safety in the shadow of their own tragedy.
They were told that it was important for them to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what makes them feel safer: to bring their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column; no evidence is needed, perceptions and internal voices are enough.
Drug smugglers, politicians, business people, journalists suspected of hiring the government or cartels, the bad guy who made a list of people's chaos dangerous to write a list of Mexico's chaos in the newspaper.
There is no share in violence, while the number of bodies increases across the country, more than that is journalists: According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 people since President Enrique Pena Nieto took over in December 2012; 589 of them are federally protected after the attacks and threats, and at least seven in seven states this year have died.
Among the last casualties were editors and inspirational sources of Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist," Valdez writes in one of his many books on narcotics violence.
His absence is deeply felt, but his presence is hanging on the front of Riodoce's building with the word "Justice" in the word "Justice" everywhere; two reporters of the 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, who are his smiles, his face with glasses and his hat, wearing his hat with glasses and his hat, which is his aladi.
The workshop takes place two months before his death; reporters talk about their common traumas, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established to handle journalist cases in 2010, he only prosecuted two of them, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders committed to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists' killers are rarely brought to the law.
In Riodoce, although their hearts are broken, they insist on addressing the violence in Sinaloa, although the ground is now more deceptive.
It's very little for you to discuss security without information about the killers, without justice, says Ibarra.
"It's stupid to waste my time at this workshop," he says.
"Unless we don't know why, you don't trust anyone."
On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the state capital.
Before the Red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men, it was only a few blocks; it was forcibly removed from its vehicle and shot 12 times, for the name of the newspaper, which was translated as the probably twelfth centrist.
The gunman got in his car and drove away and hit the car nearby.
Valdez was 50.
He's got his wife and two grown-ups.
In Culiacan, gossip tends to roam freely.
But there's almost nothing about Valdez but silence.
After Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, rival groups fought to fill the gap, while Sinaloa became one of the country's bloodiest battlefields.
In Sinaloa, let the shooting and murder of someone or many people every day on the street, or the fact that the drug kings of the cemetery are filled with or if the drug lords of the cemetery are filled with larger mausoleum than many houses for living.
For a moment, forget the situation of "cloud" just for the single cartel to control valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite this, although he was deeply aware of the dangers of Valdez's work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), the co-founder and director of Riodoce, was devastated by guilt because he failed to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes contributed to the murder.
First, in a February broadcast, there was an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival cartel groups fighting Guzman's sons.
This article may have angered the sons; possible gang members bought every copy of the raid as soon as they were distributed to the newsstands.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper with the same story was confiscated.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as a turning point in Mexican violence against journalists.
He survived for a long time, and his friends and coworkers assumed he'd always be there.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroeste in 2013 when he joined five co-workers selling $50 shares in Riodoce's discovery.
"It was impossible to be a journalist without mentioning the topic of operative," said Bojorquez.
Over time, the newspaper gained fame for its bold and honest news, and sales and ads increased.
Reporters loved publishing vital research without fear of censorship, and readers were caught up in a publication where they could read stories that no one had the courage to communicate.
Eight years after its creation, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, for the courage to let go of the Mexican drug story wherever it endures.
He clearly admitted to being scared.
During the CPJ awards, he said, "I want to keep living."
In an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said drug smuggling in Sinaloa was "a lifestyle."
"As a journalist, you must accept your duty. It's either that or you play the fool.
To me, 'What were you doing in the face of so many deaths... Why didn't you tell me what was going on?'
Riodoce staff miss Valdez; the prankster who swears like the porter, his friends who are generous in his embrace and advice, his teachers who know how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He used to go to a bar called El Guayabo across the street from the office, and he always sat at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for his routines collapsed?
His death forced them to question their own assumptions about how best they could do their jobs and survive.
"If you're dealing with their women, their children, their clean jobs, the secret plane runways they use to transport drugs, they don't like it."
"These things were to cross the line," Bojorquez said.
The result was a high-grade self-censorship and self-defense even at the best time.
Trust your own instincts.
If there's any stench, stay away.
"The smell is a deception... and what happened to Javier," said Andres Villarreal, editor of the Riodoce editor.
He and others say that the old rules are not valid in Sinaloa; the same is not valid in the same lucrative smuggling routes, which are a poisonous mixture of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states hosting corrupt government officials...
The floor is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce staff meets for security training, no cell phones are allowed suddenly; days ago, it turned out that spyware sold only to governments was used to spy on journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers wanted to get rid of the 104-degree (40 Celsius) temperature in the shade of a tree.
They were allocated by the state government to protect Riodoce's office in a four-story building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half-speaking is half-serious, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent policemen who the governor himself said was unreliable.
Reporters have been going to the mountainous countryside, where drug gangs have actually controlled.
In this week's issue, Riodoce examines three main stories.
The brother of the former great boxer, Julio Cesar Chavez, was killed in Sinaloa.
There was also a revelation of government expenditures concentrated on the governor's hometown.
And there was a kidnapping of a group at Culiacan's most expensive restaurant a block away from the D.A.'s office.
There was no official explanation as to who was abducted or how, so when it was time to write what everyone in the city knew, the prudence prevailed: the restaurant was a favorite of both drug smugglers and authorities.
From official records, a reporter learned from official records that the restaurant is registered under the name of a politician of the Corporate Revolutionary Party (PRI) in the administration, which dominates almost all levels of politics of almost all over the past century.
Recently, many PRI governors have been accused of corruption in sensational incidents.
Villareal asked the reporter to write to the reporter about the previous events, including one of the sons of "El Chapo" Guzman at the scene.
Only months ago, the readers looked at Valdez's column for information from the best source of abduction.
Villareal (46), nicknamed "El Flaco" because of its fine structure, said, "We already knew what happened before."
"All our communication channels are now cut off with our resources."
As the staff turns into action in the name of the press, for something they never expected, Valdez's office is being reused as a warehouse for banners and stickers protesting journalistic murders.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez got a few banners and went on a demonstration the next morning for another journalist in the local prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was found, and according to the DNA tests, the officials say it was him.
Journalists across the country have expressed their thoughts aloud by writing "Help to the Press" to the sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
Today, director Bojorquez is trying to provide international support for justice in the Valdez case, remotely in Washington.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that day, he thought that his anger had damaged the neutrality of his anger, and he wanted to be appointed to another post than to do the news of the government.
Valdez said that journalists in Mexico are constantly "environmental" by organised crime, an accessory, criminal officials and a reckless society.
In his last book "Narko-newspaperism," he wrote that journalists are being killed not only by drug gangs, but by order of politicians and security forces co-operating with organised crime.
The media monitor group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of last year's attacks on journalists to police and officials.
"You'll die in Mexico because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.
The murders were clearly cold shower.
Six years ago, no one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in Tamaulipas, the northern border state.
His body was found with a note that was said to have been signed by the Zetas cartel: "I am here because of my news."
A computer keyboard and headset, stripped next to his severed head.
In the northern border state Chihua, after the murder of reporter Miroslava Breach in March, some publications, such as El Norte, chose to close.
After the murder of its directors in 2004, the others from Nuevo Laredo continue, as El Manana did.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels with the editorial titled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their own provinces, even from the country.
That's a twisted decision.
It's hard to find a job in exile, and they're still combing the streets, waiting for danger.
Sometimes, three months after fleeing Veracruz, three months later, they were captured with four women in 2015 from the photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City.
It's a dance every day with these high-risk decisions for those who stay behind and keep working.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, says he scares the news of the drug trade.
"Mexico's going to hell, and that's why I'm a reporter."
In the middle of the night, a recent Saturday, while preparations were being made for the final issue, Riodoce editors began to steal phones while sitting on the sidewalk outside the office and drinking beer.
A series of armed clashes involving rival gangs and security forces near Mazatlan, a resort on the beach, resulted in 19 confirmed deaths.
The war continued to escalate, as promised in a series of cartel messages in the surrounding area.
They put the news on Riodoce's website through their cell phones on the sidewalk.
The front page would have to be changed the next day.
The sirens started singing nearby, and there's another gun fighting around here.
Bojorquez quickly took a look at the police officers on guard to see if they were alert.
They wouldn't show it if they were scared.
Under a massive portrait of the defeated founders of his newspapers, his middle finger was exhibited for the whole of Sinaloa's sight, and Riodoce's staff followed his footsteps.
"How can you think about closing," said Bojorquez, "On the day of Jaavier's murder, when the intern asked me to send him outside to report on the street?"
He used camouflage to avoid dinosaur enemies.
It looks like a statue at first glance, but to a terrible one.
Researchers have now explained that the first findings of an incredible weapon of rhinoceros sizes found by a Canadian miner were well preserved, and that experts described it as the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
He was so well preserved that they could understand that the flake skin was reddish brown and could say that he had a "problemful past."
The report in Current Biology described it as "the best preserved armored dinosaur found and one of the best dinosaur breeds in the world."
Fossil is a newly found nodozor species that lived 110 million to 112 million years from the middle of the Cretaceous Period.
He amazed the researchers who described him as "really marvelously" of the state of his extraordinary well-reserved state.
The plant-eating armor is the best preserved fossil found in its own kind, according to National Geographic's reports.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered the Suncor Millenium Mine in northern Alberta Canada, near Fort McMurray.
He hit something that looked strange than the rock around him, and he decided to take a closer look.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
They spent the next six years exposing the wild animal from the pile of 2500 pounds (1100 kg) of soil.
After such intensive work, the completed result is now ready to be revealed.
Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature was exhibited, said, "If you turn your eyes down a little bit, you might even believe that you're almost asleep."
'One of the most beautiful in the history of science and as the best preserved dinosaur species, it will be referred to as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
By examining his skin, the researchers found that although he was covered with armor and resembles a walking tank, he was likely facing a serious threat from flesh-eating dinosaurs.
He used red and white camouflage to hide from dinosaur predators, which is quite heavy armored, and used a protective technique that many of modern animals, known as contra-slugization.
Experts say it has been hunted by larger dinosaurs, allowing it to get better to blend around and get rid of its enemies.
The creature, a 110 million-year-old nodozor family, made headlines for the first time in May, and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The researchers have now finished their work, and they named the wild animal Borealopelta markmitchelli, dedicated to one of the team's team that spent more than 7,000 hours of time to uncover it.
The species is exceptionally preserved, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists made it possible for the scales to document the shape and the armor on the body.
They discovered contrast shading, which is a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the upper part of the creature is darker than the lower side.
Although contra-shading is common, the findings are surprising because Borealopelta's size exceeds the contra-shading animals that are alive today.
This means that the dinosaur is oppressed and hunted enough by flesh-eating dinosaurs, and evolution prefers to face hiding as a way of survival.
But the most contemporary animals (e.g. deer, zebras, or armadillos) using contra shading are much smaller and much more to explain to be a prey, which means that this nodozor faced a serious challenge to survive.
"The strong hunting for a heavy-armourized animal shows how dangerous dinosaur predators in the Cretacese can be," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the organic compositions on the pulp also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for clues about her life, including preserved intestinal contents, to find out what she ate at its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into a river and was dragged into the sea, where he sank on the surface of the ocean on his back.
At the time, Alberta was as hot as South Florida today, and probably the rivers and oceans were spreading a lot more inland than they are now.
"Nodozor is truly remarkable, with the fact that it is completely covered and preserved with scaly leather, but also the original shape of the animal is preserved in a 3D," Brown said.
'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it looks like in the early Cretaceous.
You don't need too much imagination to rebuild it; if you turn your eyes down a little bit, you can even believe that you're almost asleep.'
Cretacece was when giant teropods, the otter dinosaurs on two feet, wandered through the Earth.
Although he was king of all of them, Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years after Borealopelta, an armored dinosaur that could have been hunted by his majestic ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a monster weighing 38 ft (11,5m) and weighing 6 tons.
Scientists in Current Biology magazine believe that Borealopelta was dragged into the sea after death and mud mud.
The creature was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, when he was digging into the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta Canada.
According to the museum, this is the best preserved armored dinosaur, including leather and armor, and complete from the nose to the hip.
The creature is on average around 18 ft (five meters) and weighs up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
It has 2 20 inches long horns coming out of its shoulders.
Researchers believe that this armored grass obee roams the bulky bulky place where it is now Western Canada until it is dragged into the open sea by a overflowing river.
But the dinosaur's tomb under the sea preserved its perfectly detailed detail.
The fossilized remains of this special species are so well preserved that the skin fragments still cover the integrated armor layers along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a casing is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at him, the more incredible it is.
Fossilized skin still cover the tumectary armor layers, which are located at the dot point in the skull of the dinosaur.
His right front leg lies next to himself, 5 fingers intensified upwards.
I can count the stamps on the sole of my feet."
Don't be your teeth when you say whiten
White teeth and an aesthetic smile is every person's dream.
While people are resorting to various ways to whiten their teeth, Nükhet Berk, President of Oral Laser Applications Association, warns that products sold in the market or the internet should be avoided.
Nükhet Berk, who stated that such substances drawn the enamel surface and the teeth were colored so that there would never be a recycling again, said, "Whiteening of the teeth can be provided with chemical substances applied by dentists or thin porcelain surfaces that adhere to the surface of the teeth such as nails."
Berk noted that the protection of dental health prevents the occurrence of many diseases and that aesthetic applications are important for both dental and gum health and provide a good smile.
As long as there is no impairment or genetic factors in dental structures, the teeth of young people are usually white.
Due to the aging, drawing of tooth enamels and frequent consumption of cigarettes, abrasive or dark-colored beverages, the teeth are darker color over the years.
Whitening of teeth can be provided with chemical substances applied by dentists or thin porcelain surfaces that are applied without minimal or no etching on the surface of the teeth.
Teeth should never be whitened with products sold in the market or on the Internet.
Because these substances draw the enamel surface, the teeth are colored so that they will never be recycled again.
Keçiören Municipality, from 2011 to this side, provides "Woe and Oral Health Service at Home" to elderly, disabled and bedridden citizens.
Köksal Güngör, 65, who has been living a bedmate life in the Uyanış neighborhood of Keçiören for 24 years, said, "My wife has been informed of this service by Keçiören Municipality."
We called the city, they came in right away.
"I'm already paralyzed down my neck, and thanks to this service, I'm at least neglecting my dental care," he said.
"My mother has been dependent on the bed for 7.5 years because of old age," said Kezban Gökçe, a 72-year-old daughter of Gülizar Taşçıoğlu, who lives in Pınarbaşı Neighborhood.
When I came to the city hall, I saw the posters for this service, and I called right away.
We have been receiving this service regularly for 4 years.
I've got teeth, too, and they're looking at me when the doctors come.
He said, "We're very pleased."
There is no obligation for any health security for the fully free service.
" seniority" incident in the Turkish army
Dear readers, very interesting decisions were made especially for the Navy at the High Military Council meeting held the previous day.
He was appointed commander of this Force, not an admiral, but an assistant.
It is an unprecedented application in our army.
So how did that happen?
Admiral Bülent Bostanoğlu, Commander of the Force, had completed his term and would already retire...
And it happened.
Now the command order came to Veysel Kösele, the only Admiral.
Veysel Pasha, who was the victim of the conspiracy in the past and was imprisoned for a while, was supposed to be a commander in the regular seniority ranking.
But the government didn't want him.
I'm trying to make it very briefly, if we start at the top of the Navy, commanders 1, 3, 4 and 5 have not been promoted.
In this case, there was only one Admiral left in the Navy.
He had to be brought to the vacancy: Admiral Veysel Kösele, Commander of the Navy at number two.
So what happened after that?
Admiral Adnan Özbal, who was in sixth place, was appointed by the government.
Now look at this painting!
Admiral Veysel Kösele is standing there, but he's being replaced by a lower-ranking commander!
A senior is being put under the command of the junior.
I wonder what happens next.
An admiral, who is superior to the rank, does not serve or do not serve under the command of a lieutenant general who is not senior than him.
He doesn't take orders from him, he doesn't take orders.
In that case, Veysel Kösele will not bear this hurtful situation, and if he has not been retired, he will resign today or tomorrow.
This is the hurtful message he was already given by the government: "Goodbye, Veysel Pasha!"
The news of his resignation in the afternoon I wrote this article yesterday, but the situation was not officially announced.
Now let's look at what's happening again!
The government opposed Veysel Kösele, did not want, forced him to resign, and replaced him with a sixth-ranking coramira and undermining our army's traditional concept of "mass".
There's always politics involved, and we don't know the backstage.
Maybe if someone tells us soon, we'll all know!
Dear readers, I tried to explain very briefly above, especially in the Turkish army, the seniority event is very important.
Not just as rank.
For example, the officer who finished the War School in the 10th place is more senior than the one who finished 11th.
He's more senior than the one-on-one promoted to general, and he's a second-ranked promotion.
We've had the concrete examples of this seniority in the War of Independence.
Ismet Pasha, commander of the Garp Front...
He's got two armies at his disposal.
Army and 2. Army.
We came to 1922, our armies will carry out the great offensive and expel the Greek army.
At this stage, there are valuable names that are expected to be appointed as military commanders.
One is Refet (Bele) Pasha.
He's being ordered to be an army commander, but he says, "Ismet is a senior than me, I can't take command of him."
Another name is Yakup Sevki (Associate) Pasha.
Atatürk's teacher at the War Academy...
He is a valuable and senior commander who is very fond of, whom he values, calls him "My teacher," who has participated in various wars.
In 1919, he was captured along with military and civilian Turkish intellectuals and was exiled by the British to the island of Malta.
On his return to the dormitory, he is reluctant to say the same thing about the military command: "The commander of the Western Front is my senior, I can't take orders from him."
However, Atatürk convinces him of a request and Yakup Şevki Pasha accepts the command of one of our two armies.
The third is a very colorful name...
Ali İhsan (Sabis) Pasha.
He's a very talker, constantly criticized soldier.
He is a commander who has fought on Iraq, the Caucasus, Iran and various fronts.
He is also exiled to Malta by the British, he escapes from there and comes to Ankara via Kusadasi.
Ali İhsan Pasha says the same things when he was offered to the army commander: "I can't fight under the command of Ismet, who is a senior than me"...
But it's convinced...
But as it turns out, after taking office, he constantly argues with the commander of the Garp Front, Ismet Pasha, who he has taken command, makes a scene and disturbs the army...
And shortly before the great offensive, he was dismissed and retired, replaced by Nurettin Pasha with a beard.
Afterwards, Ali İhsan Pasha never improves with Atatürk.
The problem of seniority in the Turkish army stands out not only in war, but also in peace.
Of course he has to.
Veysel Kösele is the last of this.
How an activist had to learn the answer to the question "Who is the Streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shaken.
The day after he came to New York City for a ride, St. Louis' local sat in the bed of Airbnb, which he rented, and he started surfing his phone on Facebook.
It came from someone in high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old boy, and he's still lying on the street."
He was surprised to realize that no one else shared this information in the content stream, closed Facebook and turned on Twitter.
A user named @TheePharoah alias was constantly re-tweet in his content stream.
St. The rapper from the Louis district was tweeting live the death of Michael Brown, 18 years old, an unarmed black man, killed in Ferguson Missouri by a white police officer.
He shared a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street, who's staying there for four hours.
Ferrell thought to himself, "This is brutal."
But death was not new to him or for his people.
He left his phone to return to tweets about people gathering people at Canfield Drive the same evening.
There were photos of a man who claimed to be police tapes, shouting people, and a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who had a banner saying, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched a live broadcast where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a dog barking.
In another video, another cop said, he set up the trigger of his rifle and shouted, "I'm going to kill all of you... animals."
Ferrell remembered he said, "This is not customary.'"
"'This is not the kind of murder we're used to and what we call typical.'
I felt the chill at that moment.
I was angry and crying."
He booked a return ticket and went home the next day.
After landing at 11:00, he picked up his 6-year-old daughter from his father's house and the next morning he decided to go to Ferguson with him.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years will come to the cinemas on August 11th, the subject of a new documentary called "Who is the Streets?"
This is a story from the perspective of people living in that society of survival and protest, love and loss, power and resistance and fill the streets with the answers they are looking for.
While Ferrell drove his car to Ferguson with his daughter, who wore a flowery dress and wore a suitable crown for him, they returned to talk about "the experiences of the blacks and the state of blacks," which they had done several times that morning.
He remembered, "Do you remember when I taught you that black people should fight because they believe?"
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that wasn't true.
I couldn't have taken it," said Ferrell later.
"What happened here today... is the result of what happened in the past.
He needs to know, see it, and grow up in it.
It should not only develop in the field of activism and organizing, but also know what we need to do to know the layers and black state of its black experience, to liberate ourselves.
Even if I were lucky enough to give him an experience that he would not personally experience rude racism, he wouldn't be any different than any black woman-child.
I feel like I'm going to be doing her harm by protecting her from them."
When they arrived in Ferguson, their first stop was on South Florissant Road, which was opposite the police station and expected to talk about the issue that led to no subsequent crime against Officer Darren Wilson, and turned into a kind of camping for activists.
There he contacted Ferrell and his daughter's packaged food.
They prepared the bags and helped get them to the protesters.
Gradually, for Ferrell, a new form of action was forming.
"My activism has completely turned since August 9th," he said, stating that he was the president of the Minority Students Nurses Association while he was a student at the State University of Missouri, focusing on food justice and injustice in the black society.
"I had no experience with organizing.
It came from itself."
Weeks later, Ferrell met one of the film's co-directors, Sabaah Folayan, during the screening of one evening.
Folayan said that he and his cinematographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "wanted to document" what was going on.
Ferrell came up with a question: "Do you want to document it, or are you trying to find a story that you can use?"
This skepticism was reported by countless people, usually whites, to come to a society and to gain its pain and resistance.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson were inconscious, and we decided to do it in a different way."
Folayan had already contacted regional artist co-director Damon Davis, who was known for his activism for inmates with death.
His participation warmed Ferrell to the project, followed by six other natives, as well as "Streets?" In the years after Brown's shooting.
David said, "This documentary is not someone talking for us or talking to us; we are the ones who are talking."
"That's the point for me, how to represent these people because it's how to represent it."
"Although the goal is not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, he proved that the movement is "not about a crimish leader, it is about the community coming together," while he proved that the film participants are the most deficient.
As a result, "Who's the Streets?" Surprisingly, like being in love and marrying his wife, he documents the personal aspects of Ferrell's life.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell, laughing at his first vision of the finished product.
"But I knew there might be some sensitivity when I was doing this and humanizing black people."
Also, Ferrell's story reinforces and reintroduces the role of black gay women in the Black Lives Matter movement.
After the murder of the black young Trayvon Martin in 2012, two of the three founders of the movement, which derives the slogan #BlackLivesMatter on social media, define themselves as homosexual.
"The black gay women in the leadership have kept the movement alive in general," Ferrell said, "and this is because we are constantly at war on many fronts.
Black gay women have to carry all the weight of this."
"The movement is really sustained by black women and many gay black women," Folayan said.
However, Ferrell insists that "there is nothing in this kind of affirming action" and is not chosen because of his identities.
He says, "He was the one who activated this energy."
"But it's not a coincidence that he's on the front lines, because as a black gay woman, there's a lot going to happen with a life at these intersections.
You can feel his energy on the screen."
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras are long gone, but there are alarming racial connections between society and the police.
Ferrell is under another two and a half years of surveillance for closing the highway during a demonstration.
My home describes the socio-political atmosphere in the area as "combination."
Still, Ferguson hits the song he carved into his memory three years ago, when he went to the streets.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our job to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Kyrie Irving: The world is not rounded flat!
"The world is not round."
Earth's straight.
They get people used to it by giving them fear.
Oh, man, don't question it.
Because the more information you solve, the more information comes out.
That's crazy.
Earth flat?
Or is he round around?
I think you should look into it.
I'm telling you, they're lying to our faces.
They're lying to us! He used his words.
Irving, "I believed that I wanted to believe for years."
And I thought the world was round and round.
You really think we're back in the solar system?
Nothing they sent comes back.
He's not coming back!
The information they gave us is very inconsistent.
The truth is here.
You just have to look for this fact.
"Do you understand what I'm saying?" he spoke.
Kyrie Irving, who claims to be the world flat, averages 24.4 points and 5.9 assists this season with the Cleveland Cavaliers.
A Proper Similarity: The artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
In the middle of the room at the New York Fridman Gallery, there are many faces, each of which is almost indefinitely similar to each other, hanging from the cables on the ceiling.
These 30 portrait artists were created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg, ear sticks sent to him by Chelsea Manning and cut hair.
As is known, former intelligence analyst Manning, who spent 35 years of penalties after leaking classified diplomatic messages through WikiLeaks, sent his severed hair from Fort Leavenworth prison.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2nd, is called a proper resemblance.
This is a result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines his discipline with his expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a trans-woman pardoned by Barack Obama, who is pardoned for three days until his post.
By analyzing the DNA extracted from Manning in an algorithmic way and creating 30 portraits using what a person with this gene data can look like, Dewey-Hagborg revealed not only the machinability of DNA data (there are many ways that can be commented, and the determinismism from the essence of the interpretation) but also with a strict, maybe a little brain interpretation.
Manning, born as Bradley Edward but clearly described himself as a woman in adolescence, was convicted of 20 crimes in 2013, six of which were convicted of the Espionage Act, computer forgery, and theft.
His image was pressured by the prison, so that he had only one photo: a sandy black and white selfie where Manning, who was apparently anxious, sat in the driver's seat, wearing a platinum yellow wig that was self-conscious with him.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was successful with the huge relapse of his project, The Stranger Premonitions in 2012.
In this, the artist produced portraits by filtering DNA from the rashes of cigarette butts and gum to extract a picture of what these people might look like.
That's when he got an email from Paper Magazine.
"When he was in prison with Chelsea Manning, they were doing an interview, and they wanted some sort of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at the press screening of the new exhibition.
At the same time, the visit could not be taken, and he could not be photographed, so they reached Chelsea and asked if he was interested in a DNA portrait.
During the two years, the artist and his imprisoned inspiration became unexpected pen pals by making many letters exchanges.
They even uncovered the illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, a cartoon book in which the president pardoned Chelsea's punishment and could see the exhibition personally.
Obama's request for Manning's release a few days after the book was actually released was a kind of happy coincidence that was good after seven ruthless years in a military prison in Kansas.
While Donald Trump finds new, tweetable ways to further fuel the sharp divisions that he has been asked to fight and repair the government and transsexual soldiers, there is also something deep and strong about this exhibition that is now being opened.
When asked about the bizarre timing of all this, Dewey-Hagborg said, "The events take place for a reason."
A written artist statement on the wall of the gallery, which is under Manning's huge signature (the point of the "i" in his surname was put with the heart), called for an end to "automating sexual, race, sexuality and culture-based "autommatic discrimination."
There's a mitochondrial DNA sequence across the wall: a lot of Cs, G's and A's written in pencils...
By incorporating 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's sophisticated scientific dictionary), Dewey Hagborg wanted to tell us how surprisingly we are all, at least as biological creation, to each other.
"What I hope people will get out of this is that he doesn't care about who we are and how open the genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective he is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work was on display in 2007, the Imaginary Memories of the Imagination Memories.
"DNA data can tell a lot of different stories, and that's 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, held in one room, is a page from the short comic book that preceded.
Here Manning, King Kong style, is shown to leave the United States Disciplinary Barracks with a speaker in hand.
It says, "Do they shut you up, they win."
"So never shut up."
"This came directly from a letter he wrote to me," said the artist from Philadelphia.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition (as it has been considered quite predictive from the book ofcaradate) but when he sees it, he will be hailed by masks with his own genetic imitations, which are gathered like a group of protesters in the middle of the room.
Like everything in the exhibition, the length of Manning (5"2, Manning's height), whose genetic haplogroups were written with pencils, was made in particular.
"I used to put them on the wall in the past, but I wanted them to make them feel like a crowd."
"I wanted it to be perceived as a collective movement that was shaped by Chelsea, which was like the movement behind his liberation."
Northwestern training officer and Oxford University employee Wanted for Murder
Police say a nationwide manhunt has been launched for a suspected Northwestern University training officer and Oxford University employee after being found stabbed to death on a luxury apartment floor in Chicago.
Cook Administration District Records; Monday, Trenton H. For alleged involvement in the murder of James Cornell-Duranleau, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were released for first-degree murder without bail.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau (26) died several times after being stabbed.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said a body was found on July 27th.
The officers received a phone call, reached the Grand Plaza Apartments, and found the victim with many deep cuts on his body.
Official sources say Cornell-Duranleau was reported dead at the scene, and police were actively searching for two suspects while detectives were investigating stabbing as a murder.
Lathem has been an associate professor at Northwestern University since 2007 in microbiology and immunology.
Alan K., vice president of university relations, Cubbage said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was on administrative leave and that he was banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case under investigation by the necessary authorities, and the Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren's a senior finance assistant at Oxford University.
"We are in contact with the United Kingdom police and we are ready to help the US investigation authorities in any way they need," a spokesman from the University and the University of Somerville said in an e-mail statement.
Bayanda was also told that Warren's co-workers were in shock and wanted to surrender.
Communication Chief Anthony Guglielmi of the Chicago Police Department said he strongly encouraged suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"Polysin has an idea of where they are, but our efforts to identify it are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities helped find suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager, who had a mysterious clue that something had just happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very horrific.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident was on July 27th.
He said that Lathem and Warren were in the building confirmed by security cameras.
"We believe that the victim was involved with the teacher Latham," Guglielmi said.
"The police are still working on the victim's timeline and past and is investigating a number of facts, a possible domestic event," said the staff at Grand Plaza.
Italy confiscates German ship
Italian police reported that Iuventa, a ship in the Central Mediterranean, was confiscated yesterday on Lampedusa Island.
The police also shared the recordings of the phone conversations that it claimed belonged to two members of the organization with journalists, and announced that the operation was carried out under the investigation initiated by the Trapani Prosecutor's Office in October 2016.
Jugend Rettet members, who are allegedly "acting in favor of illegal immigration on the Libyan-Italy line, are said to have brought asylum seekers directly from their boats to Italy, at least three times.
Jugend Rettet members, questioned by the prosecutor's office, are also allegations that they committed the crime with some of the Libyan Coast Guard.
In a statement from the organisation, the organisation said that their priorities would continue to save human life, and that they were considering the charges against them.
In addition to the ships under the Italian Coast Guard and the European Union (EU) mission, about 9 international non-governmental organizations are involved in the search and rescue of asylum seekers in the Mediterranean.
The Italian government had prepared a 13-point code of conduct to comply with these organisations, and required the signing of it.
Last minute: Banlı's 5 buffets sealed attacking Büyükerşen
After the attack on Eskişehir Metropolitan Municipality Mayor Yılmaz Büyükerşen, the police were detained by the police and arrested by the court where they were arrested by the court, the five buffets rented from TCDD were sealed by Tepebaşı Municipality.
According to Habertürk's report, a large number of police and Agile Force teams were accompanied by municipal teams.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will complete the WADA roadmap in the short term"
Russian Prime Minister's Assistant Vitaly Mutko said it would not take a long time to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to re-enact.
"A specific phase has been completed in the fulfillment of roadmap criteria, RUSADA has the right to plan and conduct tests in cooperation with UKAD (UKK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this context," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister was evaluating the second part of the WADA Regulation Guideline Roadmap, which was recently published on the institution's website, describing the criteria regulating the re-employment of RUSADA.
According to Mutko, it doesn't involve anything to worry Russia.
"Everything has been announced, all will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, a criterion mentioned in the list states that Russian anti-doping officials are obliged to publicly accept the reported results of the state-sponsored doping investigation in Russian sports, conducted by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, approved by WADA.
Referring to the issue, Mutko said: "Our anti-doping system accepts a failure, while we are conducting the investigation.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no state program, and we will not accept anything that has not existed."
Mutko's remarks repeated the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission's president, Vitaly Smirnov.
Speaking to the Russian broadcaster RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov accepted past problems in the anti-doping organs of Russia, but added: "We have said that the report contains positions and regulations that create opposition positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept the report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
In November 2005, RUSADA's doping controls in Russia following the doping scandal was suspended by WADA.
However, under international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) supervision, this June test planning and coordination was allowed.
In July, following a visit to the institution's headquarters in Moscow, WADA Director Olivier Niggli announced that RUSADA was "cruising in the right direction" to get back to work.
100 million people watched!

The video, decorated with the dialogues of Quaresma, Pepe and Negredo, was also shared on the websites of important newspapers such as Marca, L'Equipe, La Gazzetta dello Sport.
Galatasaray President does not return empty-handed
Galatasaray former president Faruk Süren sharply criticised Dursun Uzbek, who went to Bucharest to persuade Mircea Lucescu and to Ankara, the capital, for the transfer of Ndiaye.
Here are the special explanations of the legendary president for SABAH readers:
Lucescu-Özbek interview: "We were finishing when we left."
The president of Galatasaray does not go away for nothing, and he does not return empty-handed.
Ndiaye transfer: Galatasaray President does not go to the footballer.
The football player comes to the President's foot.
Of course they meet, kiss their hands or hug...
But no matter who the player is, the president won't go to his feet.
You give 9 million Euros to the player who received 300,000 Euros by Osmanlıspor...
It's not 7.5 million, it's $9 million with bonuses!
You've already invested a lot, of course you'll play and it'll be 7.5 9...
Uzbek's actions: I don't want to criticize.
But the situation is obvious.
G.Saray's erosion.
It's not just football, it's all wrong.
The Court Board and the General Assembly will change this.
But from what I understand, the members are pleased!
Start-ups to help your company not be the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the employee happiness in the e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, unhelpful, or even worse, deceptive.
Even if he committed anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
"There has never been a amount or objectivity," says Errett, who runs Madison Reed, an e-commerce company of 75 people on hair care in San Francisco.
So he called someone outside to help.
A new kind of human resources start-up emerges to enable companies to understand how their employees feel.
These enable firms to produce a software that is to measure the preoccupation of employees, to conduct schematic options, to target specific teams and demographic groups, to provide employees with anonymity and complaints, and in some cases, to bypass senior managers and to go directly to the board of directors and to allow employees to be announced as irregularities.
"Now there are tools that monitor your health such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is your company's Fitbit?" said Jim Barnett, the co-founder of Redwood City start-up, which measures the busyness of software analysis tools companies.
Errett says he uses Glint to understand what his employees think and feel after three years.
In addition to offering specific teams with complaints, it offers a warm map of which parts of the company receive the most complaints and which manager has low-liking points, so that the reasons for them can be tampered with.
In order not to be the next Uber, companies are beginning to understand that they need to know about the culture of their workplaces; Uber has been in a scandal since he described an environment of harassment in which those who clearly say what he thought in a blog post published by a former employee.
For start-ups like Glint, this request for surveillance means a very profitable business opportunity.
According to the website Let's Talk Payments, the global management, regulatory and compliance industry could be worth $118.7 billion by 2020.
The interest and event in Denver Colorado-based start-up Convercent, which helped companies detect and prevent bad behavior, increased among Uber's discredit debates earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to make personalized "pulse" polls, collect real-time secret responses, and extract heat maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous helpline where employees can report bad behavior.
If the president is charged, the complaints go directly to the board of directors.
Patrick Quinlan, the founder and president of Covercent, said, "The public court has taken over the regulators."
Quinlan said: If a company is mistreats or ethically treats its employees or does not act ethically, consumer boycotts may face costly consequences due to child boycotts, employee casualties, or lawsuits, even if the regulators do not come into play.
With more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, the restaurant chain Ruby Tuesday has been using Convercent for more than a year to help its employees know about principles and procedures and provide easy access to the company headquarters.
When a former employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find a phone number or email belonging to the company's headquarters, filed an official complaint and hoped it would be taken seriously.
James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's chief legal counsel, said that these are mostly eye-intimidating and disturbing experiences, there is no good way to follow employee complaints.
But with the company using Convercent, problems that previously hide from managers sitting in office, city or state distances (such as discrimination, harassment or unfair salary practice) can be detected and solved faster.
"I can get closer to this employment experience from a holistic, 360-degree perspective," said Vitrano, who led Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"Also, we protect our shareholders against business cases."
After the 2002 accounting firm Arthur Andersen sank due to violations of ethical values caused by the Enron scandal, companies dealt with ethics, values and relations with the employee more seriously in 2002, Quinlan said.
But after "social media has come to its senses," the firms realized that they can't prevent their dirty laundry from going viral.
"People used hope as a strategy before technology was used to control ethics," he said.
They offer both Glint and Convercent software as a service and receive repeated fees for the use of their products.
This is a business model and opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors supporting both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in financing from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February and increased its total capital to $47 million.
Glint secured $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and increased its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are not surprising, given the nature, cultures and risk capitals of companies that are connected to each other.
Increasing amounts of research show that today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
High salaries and interesting projects in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are only minimum requirements.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, valued and give their time to a company with a positive mission.
Nina McQueen, vice president of LinkedIn's global benefits and employee experience, using both Convercent and Glint, said: "When people are happy to be in a company, when they feel their voices heard, and the work they do is satisfactory, they become more sincere to make that company successful."
Investors make a profit when their portfolio companies do good; if companies, employees are sincere and feel owned by the company, they do good.
It is not surprising that if third-party analysis tools promise to increase the sincerity and feeling that employees are genuine.
Having data about employee loyalty is important according to business culture experts.
But the data is useless if the company's culprits don't act.
In fact, a company can create an expectation that the change is coming if it wants feedback from its employees.
And if the expectation doesn't come fast enough or never comes, it can be disappointing and make employees feel like they're broken.
"If you will ask 4000 suggestions, you need to be ready to talk about 4000," said Russell Raath, who is the head of consulting at the management company Kotter International and sees that companies are mistakenly overly trusting data collection.
"Because if you don't follow, the employees will think, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why do I care?'"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who conducted monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem was reported in Glint.
And after collecting feedback from employees who are tired of the decision-making and the speed of communication quality, he was able to reorganize various teams within the company and added communication training to solve problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company receives new insights into its employees, and in the long run, it hopes that this will turn into a large number of workers in such an industry, which is known to be able to hold more workers.
"If you are not dependent on creating a culture of transparency, you will lose people."
"And if you lose people, you'll lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you will lose the firms."
It's a long day for Bruins when the NCAA lifts two exercises every day.
It comes to 11 o'clock at night, and a crowd of UCLA football players are hanging out to chat on one side of the new training field on campus.
Some reveal their sweaty ridges, which have stripped off their jerseys, the trouble of the first day in the training camp.
For a significant part of the team, these blank moments are a midday break.
After 3 hours of training, the players enrolled in the summer classes will return to their dormitories and will take the final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for the meetings at 6.30 the next morning.
"The next three days are a torment for these men."
Organized to remove the burden on the players, the NCAA's lifting two trainings a day, at least until the finals ended on Friday, in fact prolonged their days.
Therefore, UCLA's first three trainings were programmed to start at 7.15 p.m., which would adapt to the players' already cramped program.
In exchange for two trainings a day, more than a day training is more than a week ahead of the start of the camp, and during the summer school, he trains at summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
In September, they plan to train 18 until August 20th, before they begin their official match preparation for their opening against Texas A&M.
Mora said the NCAA supports the rule change, although players have added new items to the busy work schedule.
Mora said, "We put a giant burden on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging."
"And they've been through it recently; they're working, they're great kids.
I think when we get to Saturday, we'll have more time, it's going to be really great."
UCLA will stop training when the camp runs out; the luxury hotel Luskin Center, which is rained in the next parking lot and the next-door football and closes the back of the castle with a protective net, is not easy to work when it comes to the line of sight of their court.
Bruins players are scheduled to settle at the hotel from the beginning of this week, but Mora agrees that there may be a problem with the emptying of these rooms during the season.
"We'll have safety," Mora said.
"It's a real concern, and it's not too crazy to think that someone's gonna rent a room and sit there and videotape a practice.
If there's a video of a practice, that's a pretty good thing.
But we'll have security there, and we'll have security upstairs at parking space eight.
We'll do our best with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan."
Facebook increases story verification power to fight against fake news
Facebook will send more potential fake articles to third-party storytellers and show their findings under the original sharing; that's how the world's largest online social network told her attempts to fight the so-called fake news on Thursday.
The firm said on its website that they would use updated machine learning to identify possible frauds and send them to storytellers, and that it would potentially show the story verification results under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the main distribution points of news that many know as fake news that they think has affected the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem turned into a major political outpost in Europe, as French voters flooded false news before the presidential election in May and Germany failed to quickly remove hateful postings to social media networks there before the September elections.
A separate Facebook quoted in German on Thursday that a test of the new story verification feature is being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Sara Su, Facebook news stream product manager, said on a blog: "In addition to seeing what stories are discussed by third party storytellers, people want more resources to read and share to make information-based decisions."
He added that Facebook will continue to test the "related article" feature and will work on other changes in the news stream to reduce fake news.
Creating comics: The story of a Castle in England
In his recent past, he appeared in a little Scotney music video, and was a sanctuary for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But now, Scotney, who inspired a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes of a Yorkshire man who was fond of broom-haired, historical documents, witnessed a 700-year turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the Bewl River valley in the Kent.
"I find it very good to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says in a tribute.
"What a personal bond is to keep this letter in my hand."
In England, dating back to the Middle Ages, a Castle documents the families of Scotney to be depicted by a different artist (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg) from the United Kingdom.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: he also wrote the Teeth and Other Stories of the Dead Men in 2014, a project inspired by the stories from the British Library, which he unexpectedly finds emotional.
"I'm staring at a fingerprint on the side of a letter written in the 1700s by a two agent working for King James fans," he says.
"That was his thumb!
And the letters smelly all the time because you used to light a fire for light.
For someone who's 300 years ahead, it feels like he's there.
Oh, I love archives!"
As someone in love with old papers, it seems to be very good to get support from the National Trust and the British Art Council and stay in a castle for almost four months ("I have exceeded my warm welcome, if necessary, I have exceeded my warm welcome.").
Rhodes explored the Victorian-era "new" fortress, scans the archives and working on many treasures and antiques such as hyena heads mounted on the walls of the mansion and bottles that have spent centuries in ditches.
He traveled the lands and ruins of the old castle by talking to the guards, gardeners, and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then at night, he would "stricken and start writing".
Since the National Trust was able to access the full access only when Elizabeth Hussey died in 2006, Scotney's detailed date is relatively unknown.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff began to take the archives, which he described as saying: "The centuries-old aristocrats were saying: "Oh, throw him in the attic."
Diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps that determine the limits of who has what: "You think that soil disputes will be boring," Rhodes says, "But there was a birch that the two families had quarrelled on.
Forget it, men!"
Some stories in the collection, including The Labourer, who left the newly built fortress to join the Peasant Remedy in 1381, use the castle as a leap point to make a wider entrance into British history.
"In this book The Knight's Families of Kent and Sussex, there is a record of a rebellion in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The village rebellion started in this area, and I thought a rebellion could be a good starting point.
Maybe these two are connected?"
Other stories are closely linked to the history of the castle, for example, The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family, who hid a Jesuit priest for 7 years during the British Islahats.
Or The Smuggler, which includes the 18th-century smuggler Arthut Darrell, who was thought to have filled a coffin with stones and staged his own funeral (annations after years when his coffin was removed from the ground).
The Darrells Rhodes' favorite Scotney family: "These gentlemen seemed like a lot of deceit, they were always in debt, and they were spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men solved their debt crisis by marrying rich old women, and I imagine them as a group of handsome men who are capable of courting women."
Rhodes, whose mission at the castle is finished, is in search of other singular writing experiences.
In his Finnish wildlife life, at the beginning of the 20th century, he completed a two-week job for a comic book about Elma'm, which has since been recaptured by nature, a field of a sanatorium.
But Scotney holds a place in his heart.
"I was sorry I broke up."
"It's like, 'Oh, I have to go now and face your fucking real life.' " "
"Maho" reaction to Meral Akşener
Ismet Büyükataman, Secretary General of the Nationalist Movement Party, recently made a written statement on the allegations of resignation in the social media and the press about the MHP.
Büyükataman said from social media and "some old rifles were "flowing" to the MHP, "the bases of some old rifle Marxists", saying "plays and stalls have been applied to prevent the national movement from continuing its existence under the roof of MHP after 12 September."
Büyükataman said:
"How many records of the Turkic nation who cannot digest the historical existence of the Turkish nation, who cannot attract the homeland of the Turks, the criminal case is fluffy, the idea is blurred, the mind is disturbed, the mind is disturbed, the mind is disturbed, the mind is confused, it rubs his hands."
"Now they have left "MHP Kocaeli Gölcük District Organization administration and members 410 people and MHP 215 people resigned in the Yenişehir district of Bursa."
250 resignations and 300 resignations are misled by unfounded news.
In the columns of the newspaper, the lie has become giant, the deception has deepened.
There is no resignation that we have received in this number, and the number of detainees in the mentioned places does not exceed the fingers of one hand.
Büyükataman, who described the "so-called" about resignations, said that the public was tried to be misled and perception management was tried to be misdirected and perception management with the polls he called "so-called."
"These will backfire propaganda and campaigns towards creating perceptions against the MHP," Büyükataman said.
Stating that MHP is an important and indispensable actor of Turkish politics, MHP Secretary General Büyükataman said the following about the resignations:
The power of the ancient Marxists, whose swords were left behind to destroy the MHP's conscience of the Turkish nation, is not capable.
Behind all the interpretations, the applied perception management methods lies a dirty account.
Because politics and media have set their sights on the MHP base.
Those who do no good work and effort in the favor of our party while we are among us, resigning now, do not make any sense in our eyes.
Those who couldn't take advantage of our party on their own, resigned?
The people who did not benefit MHP in their lives, did not share our memories, did not understand our ideals, did not participate in our struggle, and even if they did, the mindset that stood on the sidelines should find another occupation for themselves, whose heart has been stoned.
The efforts of those who cannot withdraw the unity and integrity of the Nationalist Movement Party, the quest for discussion and faction, is a futile effort.
And he will surely turn back and shoot the owner.
Despite the heavy destructions, the Nationalist Movement is the last fortress of the Turkish nation to stand up straight.
In his statement, Büyükataman said that he was targeting the MHP, "political counterfeiters" and "political snatchers" for those he claims to be targeting MHP, "Nationalist movement is not unattended."
"The external altars inside, which feeds from beyond the ocean, will not achieve their goals, no matter what the cost," he said.
"The traitors of the manuscript will return to mad and will be burned in a fire," said the MHP's Büyükataman, who in his statement, listing opposition parties and terrorist organizations together: "From the CHP to the HDP, from the D.C. to the Perinçekgil, from the PKK to the FETÖ, will not be able to operate, the right of the Turkish nation to claim their own destiny."
Yesterday, we resisted the new tactics and games of MHP-free MHP-free MHP-free government, the MHP-free MPs without MHP.
And now we're gonna break the games, we're gonna ruin the players.
"The patent of nationality is in MHP," Büyükataman implied Meral Akşener and said: "Just like an old Yeşilçam production Banker Bilo, Maho peasants will take them to Germany, and he walks in the truck vault for days, just as he left him on a mountain slope of Istanbul, the resigners of the zat they went after him, saying he is taking you to power and leave you to the edge of the cliff."
This is their matter, but all we ask of these detainees is that they are new to where they go.
Kjaer signs for Seville
Kjaer signed an official contract as the most expensive transfer of the Spanish team to Seville for a fee of 12.5 million euros from the yellow-blue team.
The Danish star will wear the number four shirt in Seville.
Great convenience for families with babies from THY
According to the THY Press Consultancy, the national airline, which prioritizes the comfort and satisfaction of its passengers and works to make them feel more comfortable throughout the flight, continues to develop new ideas for an excellent travel experience.
In this respect, the "baby travel kit" prepared by examining the needs of babies and their families between the ages of 0-2, started to be offered to passengers with babies traveling on intercontinental flights since August.
The kit, which is prepared with a specially designed bag, includes a change cover, disposable food apron, rash cream, baby lotion and shampoo, neonatal wet cotton wipes and chest pad.
Products that do not contain Paraben, alcohol, dye harmful chemicals were produced with the sensitivity of the baby skin in mind.
Washington Changes Green Card Rules
According to the media, President Donald Trump said there would be a new US immigration plan that made changes to the Green Card rules.
It envisages lowering legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for temporary work permits, and restrictions for family visas.
The new rules were proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president.
The draft law will be discussed in both branches of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase salaries, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the United States gives Green Card to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current regime.
This new application process will benefit English-speaking candidates, self-sufficient financial resources and talents that will help our economy," Trump quoted the American media as saying.
Authors commented on Fenerbahçe-Sturm Graz match
Kadıköy had regained the enthusiasm and glory I could not see, which I could not find for two seasons...
A "border-hearted" team that Aykut Büyük had in poverty was on the field to make the "stay behind" deal with his supporters.
We can bring criticism to your game, positions or performances, but I haven't seen such a game that has been working and calling for so much.
He showed up in the first game, but yesterday he put his epaulettes on his shoulder; Fenerbahçe's commander on the field is now Valbuena.
He had a problem with his age when he was transferred, but Big's words had the phrase "non-responsive character."
30 years ago, we gave Reza Çalımbay the name of the atomic ant.
If he handles it, it will be the most worthy of the French player.
He was all over the field, participated in all the pass organizations, always took responsibility and scored a goal, and made him look like a giant show in the shortline.
Alper's second striker position left Sturm Graz on the field for a long time.
Fenerbahçe constantly searched for a formula to overcome such a hard wall while closing the winner without throwing corners.
They're dominating the ball, but they can't produce effective passes in the field of opponents.
This image may bring a comment "I need a price," but we are faced with a game that hesitates to pass to Ahmethan, which can't put the only centro in his hand.
Either the team doesn't trust the young player, or his performance needs to improve a little bit.
After the score was 1-1, they did not take advantage of two net opportunities.
It was important for them to pass the tour, but raising this supporter as "gol" who stood up to the players' struggle would make the night even more beautiful.
Probably 1-2 new transfers will come by Monday.
But the truth is that Fenerbahçe's biggest need is number 12...
We are on the threshold of a very bright and enjoyable season with this style of play that carries the heart of the people in the stands who are trying to play in the front.
Aykut Big's machine is setting up his zember, he needs a little more time.
They're good in physics.
The quality of the game will also improve.
You can also see that the confidence of all the footballers on the field is increasing.
They really need the applause for a new page.
The rise of sex robots is real and we must worry
While you think 2017 will not get any weirder, a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot industry is coming out.
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Responsible Robotics Science Agency (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a retired professor from robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University, and one of the founders of FRR, we should take their ascension seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, nipple shape and nail type.
"People are laughing at them, but the firms are actually shipping a lot and we'll see them more."
Modern sex dolls evolved into robots with silicone skin, which is warm to touch from their likes that can be blown up, especially with reactions such as human beings performed by artificial intelligence.
Users can also customize their robots to match their own blood by choosing everything from the robot's eye color to the nipple shape and the nail type or color.
But with many robots having "personalities" enough to make a Stepford Woman innovative, this becomes even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls evolved into silicone leather robots.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to customize their own robots according to their character characteristics (e.g. shyness).
Then, developed by True Companion, there are Roxxx Gold sex robots, including "Frijit Farrah" and "Wild Wendy," which gives the impression of shyness, which comes with pre-programmed personalities.
True Companion's website is raging: "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that fits as much as possible to your personality."
So you love what you like, whatever you don't like, whatever you don't like, etc.
Besides, like real people, they're in a mood during the day.
He can be sleepy, he can be willing to talk, or he can be "in full mode."
There are many disturbing things about the rise of sex robots: not only replace real human relations, but highly obedient female personality traits, rapselling connotations as they approach Frijit Farah are the most thought-provoking.
True Companion on the website likens Roxxxy to a vibrator but what is for men.
"If the woman (in her name is just like that) can be a vibrator, why not the Roxxxy of men?"
But these sex robots aren't just a fetish or sex toys.
Their emergence and increased complexity point to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex through subjugation, an optional add-on.
Many men will naturally not have sex robots, and FRR draws attention to their growing popularity, but for the time being, they are located in the outer periphery of consumer culture.
But those who pass through the ends can be highly instructive about the course of our time.
A lot of people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them the right to be that way.
With a president at the White House bragging about sexual assaulting women, it's no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots emerged at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide.
The creepy thing about The Handmaid's Tale TV series is not depictions showing all the details, noose corpses or carved eyes, but how realistic the image feels.
The Gilead Republic is a sudden change, but it doesn't feel like it's such a big change right now.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create as much physical resemblance to real women (of course, in the proportions of porn movie stars) to the extent technologically possible.
Their creators want them to give human feelings when they touch and imitate the movements of a true body.
But when it comes to their "persons," robots clearly do not represent real women.
They can't leave their wives or leave them.
They don't have any activities or past stories, there's nothing to reveal their independence, or disrupt the fantasy of total slavery.
In other words, they are delightful slaves.
Or as 2017 says: concubines.
Attack on the American military convoy: There are dead and wounded...
The suicide bombing in Karabakh, the capital of Afghanistan, targeted foreign military forces operating in the country.
1 NATO soldiers and 3 civilians were killed in the explosion, 5 of the injured were American soldiers in the convoy and 1 were translators working with NATO forces.
NATO support forces in Afghanistan (Resolute Support) said NATO forces detonated the homemade explosives during a joint patrol with the Afghan National Army.
It has been reported that the injured personnel have been treated at the U.S. Military Hospital of Bagram Airport.
There's no life-threatening casualties.
Local media say the suicide bomber is a Taliban member.
Trump's great skill?
Make Mitt Romney look like a common sense
The fact that the political division, which polarized US voters, divided families on a microscale, was the reality of the Trump era.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the United States were full of how to deal with the nightmare of relatives who voted for Trump.
We're all trying to blow up our own filtering bubbles.
What's less on it is Trump's power to bring the families together.
I'm referring to this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has a broken relationship with the Republicans in our family, is visiting us in New York this week.
He reminded me that unity against a common enemy could have a strong effect.
With Trump's presence in the White House, everyone he's known, including his Republican brother, whom he's been arguing about politics for decades, suddenly and strangely, is on the same side.
It's a good thing, of course, at the dinner table, but it seems to me that in a broad context, it carries these significant risks.
Sol was revived by Trump, but the twisting effect created by the presidency created the power to push to the right for me.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we're talking about the terrible possibility that one day his strange behavior might no longer be shocked.
In fact, there's a more terrifying long-term scenario, which Trump "normalizes right-wing Republicans" who oppose their standards, and they suddenly seem to be the symbol of logic.
I find myself experiencing nostalgia about the bizarre version of Mitt Romney's madness: the dog on the ceiling of the car, the 14% income tax (at least we knew what his tax return looked like), which they are both really very lightly off than Trump.
When Trump leaves, he only needs to be sane to assess the irremeable progress of the next Republican candidate.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the merry-go-round at Central Park, the biggest carasels run by the New York parks department, and the three best bucks you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are giganticly large, fiberglass designs on the central cylinder (the clowns and animals that all make strange faces have turned to look behind their shoulders with fear) and the music that jingle is bizarrely exciting.
In other words, many clichés of a city can be disappointing: the landscapes of high-rise buildings begin to become boring, the horizon line begins to become too familiar to be too exciting, and the reality of the city does not reach the dream.
It's been 30 or five years, and I still haven't been able to overcome the day I discovered that Swiss Cottage was a large donkey intersection in North London, not a Swiss country house, but a Swiss country house.
However, the carousel in Central Park is still a strangely magical experience, so that two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old person, and two women in their 40s can all have a great time.
If I could give him a note of the carvings, I'd give him a full note, but thank God no one asked.
On the other hand, before passing my credit card in a bondma this week, I was asked to evaluate the transaction "experience" between 1 and 5 stars.
It's the same thing in the coffee shop on the corner of my street, and the option to match the note to a tip of 15% for what was bought from the counter...
The effect of this is not only slowing down what should be an impartial exchange, but also pressures the server to give personality to an event that is never needed.
While the poor woman at the bonmarche was grinning like apologizing, I gave her five stars to give her credit card.
They wore swimsuits when the temperature exceeded 41 degrees
In Tunceli, where one of the hottest days of the season took place, the public flocked to Munzur beaches.
With the heats coming out of the afternoon, young, children, old, women and men who entered the beaches near Munzur River tried to protect themselves from the heat by cooling in the ice-cold waters.
The beaches on the edge of Munzur River were overflowing due to the fact that Tunceli citizens living in countries such as Germany, Netherlands, France and England spent their holidays in their homeland instead of the Aegean or the Mediterranean.
Suna Tosun, which is among the coolers in Munzur Beach, stated that she preferred Tunceli instead of the western provinces for the holiday, "I did not want to spend my holiday in the west, to cool off in Munzur as a family, to stay on our own land."
"Munzur's icy water is nowhere in the world, Munzur cools us at these temperatures," he said.
Hasan Ulu, who came from Germany, said that they preferred Munzur River coast in Tunceli instead of Cesme or Bodrum coasts and that they did not regret it.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital with chest pains
This is Pistorius' second time left the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, which he said had occurred after he fell in his cell by the prison officials.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an objection by prosecutors to the previous accidental manslaughter.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, Steenkamp killed him several times at his home in Pretoria, at the door of a toilet cabin.
Pistorius claimed that he had confused his girlfriend with an intruder at night hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have once again expressed their intention to object to Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they thought was very light this time.
National Prosecution Mercii said he would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be assessed this year.
Pistorius, if the prosecutors succeed, he will face an increase in his sentence to 15 years.
There are no death sentences in South Africa.

We won't go back to Holland until we find him
JOEY Hoffman (22) went to Turkey to visit with two friends in July.
Joey Hoffman, who travelled Adana and Mersin in the car they rented, disappeared in Silifke on 8 July.
His friends, who came with, could not reach Hoffman despite all the calls, so he informed his family in the Netherlands.
As the police also took action to find the missing tourist, his brother Robin Hoffman and his friends Angelo Durei and Jaimy Gewald went to Adana.
THEIRS AND DISTRIBUTION
Robin Hoffman, who applied to the police, issued missing persons reports in Adana and Mersin to find his brother.
Robin Hoffman stated that the last time they heard from his brother had been heard from him on July 8th, "We first applied to the police in the Netherlands."
Then I came to Turkey with two friends and applied to the police here.
So far, we haven't heard from any news, and we haven't found a clue.
"We will stay in Turkey until my brother is found, until a news is received," he said.

His last words were 'I think I'm dying, farewell mother'
Among those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire in London, which was reported to be 30 so far, called her mother at the time of the fire and said, "I don't want to die, Mom, that's not fair."
It was announced that there was also Italian Gloria Trevisan and her lover, who said, "Thank you for everything you did for me, goodbye."
Among the dozens of unannounced people after the fire were 26-year-old Gloria Trevisan and Italian lover Marco Gottardi, who lived on the 23rd floor of the 24-story building.
Maria Cristina Sandri, lawyer of the Trevisan family in northern Italy, announced that it was certain that both young people had died, according to information from British talents.
Stating that the families of young people are experiencing great pain, the lawyer also asked journalists not to insist on getting an explanation.
I think I'm dying, farewell, Mom
Lawyer Sandri said that Gloria called her mother Emanuela Trevisan on her cell phone shortly after the fire broke out and that she cried when she listened to the last conversations that your mother recorded.
According to this, Gloria Trevisan spoke to her mother several times for 2 hours after the fire, which started at around 01.00 local time.
"Mother, bad things are happening here, there's a fire."
We're stuck, we can't go out.
There's some smoke, but don't worry, we're waiting to be rescued.
"We tried to get out by opening the door, but there was a lot of smoke, and the elevator wasn't working," he said.
With the growth of the fire, Gloria Trevisan's last words were quoted as saying:
Mom, my whole life is flashing before my eyes.
I think I'm dying.
I had a life ahead of me, and that's not fair.
I don't want to die, and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I can never hold you again.
Thank you for everything you've done for me, good-bye, Mom.
I'm going to heaven now, and I'm going to help you from there.
This is the fault of the Italian government
Gloria Trevisan, both of whom were trained as architecture, and her lover Marco Gottardi, moved to London from the northern Veneto region in the north of the country in March, when they struggled to find a job after graduating last year.
Gloria Trevisan, who had only found a 300-euro-paid job in her country, soon started working in London with a monthly work of 1800 quid (about 2060 euros).
"Gloria went to London to help her family," said lawyer Sandri, saying Gloria Trevisan's family had a hard time.
Unfortunately, our young people have to leave the country to save their future and find a job.
"The government must find a solution to this problem immediately," he said.
The drama of Italy, which can not provide employment for its young people
Gloria's father, Loris Trevisan, said, "This is the fault of our government, which forced our young people to flee abroad to find a job."
In Italy, the unemployment rate reaches 12 per cent, while the rate among young people has exceeded 40 per cent.
As a result of this increase in this problem, many Italian youths have begun to migrate to many European countries, especially the UK.
Only last year, the number of young people who had to leave Italy for unemployment exceeded 110,000.
As the news of Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi's death was finalized, Italian media commented that this was the drama of a country that could not provide employment for its young people.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can lighten IBH
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims the exact opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy products can help relieve the symptoms of those suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
This incompatitable health condition, which affects 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the United Kingdom, causes stomach cramps and swelling, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and excessive fatigue.
Although patients are often advised to skip meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the protein's essential amino acid tryptoppha helped the development of immune cells that developed a durable intestine.
Chief researcher Dr. Marco Colonna stated that immune cells patrol the intestines so that microbes stored at food do not sneak into the body.
The cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced with cells that promote endurance by protecting sensitive tissues without harm.
If the balance shifts too much towards inflammation, it can occur as a result of inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments, it was found that a kind of immune cell appeared that promotes endurance in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their intestines.
And bacteria need tripphoana, one of the building blocks of protein, to trigger the emergence of cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a connection between the type of bacteria Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of the cell population that promotes endurance."
The mice with more tryptophan in their diet had more immunity cells.'
If the same thing happens in humans, L. said that a diet rich in recitation and tryptophan can develop a more durable, less inflammatory bowel environment.
Post-doctoral researcher Dr. While Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas was working on a kind of immune cell that enhances endurance, a group of experiment mice have such cells, but found that another group of others, which is of the same kind and is kept in a different place.
He suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal microbiomes of mice, in other words, normally the gastrointestinal tract, the bacteria, viruses and fungi communities.
DNA was sequenced in the intestines of mice of mice, and mice with immune cells found that there were six species of bacteria, but that was missing in mice without them.
Mice who lacked an intestinal microbiome and did not develop this kind of immune cell were given L. reuteer, and immune cells appeared.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers enlarged L. reuteri in liquid, and then transferred less than this non-bacterial liquid to the immature immune cells taken from mice.
Immune cells have become cells that promote endurance.
It turned out that the active ingredient is a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as indole-3-lactic acid, when it was purified from liquid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of cells increased by around 50 percent, but the number of cells decreased by half when the triptophan levels were halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that humans have cells that promote the same resilience as mice, and most of us contain L. reuter in the gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the tripptophan side products from L. reuteri develop as in mice in humans, but the disorders in the genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
"The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage, because these cells control the inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
The high level of tryptophan in the event of potentially L. reuteri's current cause this population to spread."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United has signed a 'genius' with Nemanja Matic
After playing his first match against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening, Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United had signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic.
The 40 million transfer from Chelsea began with a 2-1 win in Dublin ahead of the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday in the pre-season match of United, and Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira, in a position to be in a position to hold forward while attacking further, according to Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic, who was left out of the Blues' pre-season tour of Asia, was seriously lacking in match conditions, and was able to only produce 45 minutes; Mourinho admitted that this should be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence, his thinking genius... He's thinking about football."
"We'll help him get ready sooner."
Mourinho began to shape his first 11 for the beginning of the season, while his new transfer friends Victor Lindelof and Rome's Lukaku also played at the Aviva Stadium.
The Independent found that Mourinho still wanted three more transfers this week, but that the club had already carried out three of its four priority transfers, insisting that it had done "extraordinary work."
"I thank the club for taking three of the four," he added.
"I'd be happier if they got four out of the four, but they made a great effort for me."
197 people were sent to the hospital last year
According to the data of the Sweh Social Welfare Institution, the diagnosis of gender discontent in one person in one hundred thousand people in 2005 increased to 8 per cent in 2015.
Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital was transferred to 197 people, mostly children and young people who were dissatisfied with the sex she was born in last year.
"The opening in the psycho-sexual area, including questions about sexual identity, can be perceived as a general development in society," said Lousise Frisen, a child psychiatrist at the same hospital.
It is known that the discomfort of sex discontent has no connection with sexual orientation.

Good luck to our new Malatyaspor."
The British inventor put himself a micro chip to get into his house and car with a hand gesture
A British inventor was the first person in the country to open the front door, to access his office, and even to run his car with only one hand gesture.
Steven Northam (33) transported the little chip between his thumb and his finger, and now he offers the company BioTeq, which is currently looking to facilitate their lives with technology.
Dr. Dr., an associate anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure can be performed in medical standards. Geoff went to co-operate with Watson.
The technology is similar to the micro chip transferred to cats and dogs and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company will also modify the locks in homes and vehicles, 300 per lock to be consistent with the chip.
The man who was married and father of a child was fitted with both his home and the BMW Z4, and his car was running while his hands were behind the wheel.
White House Show Obtains Taxpayers for Thousands
According to military records released to TIME, the White House's decision to fly a naval infantry helicopter on the south's grass for an organization that highlighted American production last month cost taxpayers a figure of up to $24,000.
When the president boarded, the green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One, was the center of attention in the organization that introduced American construction programs on July 17th at the White House.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials visited products produced in all 50 states.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was displayed side by side with a yacht from Main, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
According to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the helicopter operates; the White House Warfare Office requested the helicopter's presence only 36 hours before landing on the southern grass for the "extraordinary" organization of the helicopter with an individual order (also called the FRAGO).
The commander of HMX-1 sent an e-mail to the Deputy Marine Aviation Commander, the above, the day before the organization, "I just wanted to make sure you were aware because this is an unusually high visibility organization."
The message stated that the helicopter would come to the southern lawn around 7 p.m. on the morning of July 17th for the event at 3 p.m., where the grass would remain until the grass was cleared from 6 to 9 p.m.
The note added that if the exit from the White House was delayed, a second flight team would be required for the return flight due to the time limitations.
While the unit security personnel were on the ground, the original flight crew was in the helicopter during the organization.
From the records provided to TIME, it is unclear whether a second flight crew is ultimately necessary.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records show that HMX-1 is investigating whether the organization violates this condition.
"A question we asked was whether it violated the Hatch Act and it was reported to us that it did not." written in the form.
"It seems like you're locked up," he replied.
The "Made in America" organization is designated by the White House as an official organization and does not fall within the scope of the Hatch Law.
But even official organizations have political innuendoes.
In the organization, the president addressed the ongoing efforts for health care reform in the Senate at the time and praised his efforts to reinstate government arrangements.
Using aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is not a new event.
The presidents need to use them to travel.
But it's unusual that they are officially requested to be used for an opportunity to take a photo.
Trump drew attention in February, when his first campaign rally in Melbourne Florida went backstage and the predecessor of his Twitter account was filled with messages about the use of the presidential plane.
Lindsay Walters, deputy press secretary at the White House, said: "The White House is excited about the 'Made in America' exhibition, where products are made by American workers from all 50 states with American materials."
The HMX-1 crew often perform training flights in the Washington area and exercises to leave the President of the United States with a dot shot to the White House on the south lawn.
During the beginning of July, Trump made 58 exercises at the HMX-1 White House while he was in Germany for the G-20 summit.
One official said that the flight for the Made in America organization was counted as the air crew's need for training during that month.
Unit helicopters flew for an additional 11 hours that day for "support missions that have nothing to do with the presidential.
The White House said that taxpayers were not burdened by any other number involved in the organization.
A spokesman from Sikorksky said his firms did not participate in the adjustment of the helicopter's display on the southern lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost that has been made by the organization.
But according to the time rates of the Ministry of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DOD's meeting rate for the VH-3D is $24,340 per flight time.
Unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico headquarters in Virginia to both sides.
The White House claims that the helicopter's real operating expenses are far below that rate.
"It is very misleading to taxpayers to make an expense based on the estimates of the cost-paying rate," Walters said.
"These rates cover submerged costs, including personnel, maintenance and annual expenses."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the Ministry of Defense's expense costs do not include personnel expenses, but includes fuel, maintenance and contract expenses.
At the time, Sean Spicer, former press secretary of the White House, advocated the use of the helicopter for this organization.
"Here is the idea to showcase what's done in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that the state of Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of their contributions to our national security, and I think, even if there are no thousands, hundreds of people's jobs depend on it.
And I think we're all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that many Americans, like most Americans, work tirelessly to do.
Therefore, of course, it is appropriate to make this stand out."
It is unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while traveling through the southern lawn for the organization, but he stepped into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Within the White House, Trump joked with the media about company products in his fleet and addressed Sikorsky representatives.
"I know well about Sikorsky," he said, "I have three of them."

GMB concerns in McVitie's investment in the Glasgow factory
A union asks the managers of the biscuit producer McVitie's to guarantee a long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company remains silent about the future of investment in the Tollcross region.
More than 500 people work in the factory where Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits are produced, among other products.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, said they have invested more than 5 million pounds in the region over the past few years.
He added that if there is a change in their operations, the employees and union representatives will be "first informed".
In a letter to the company's facility manager, GMB asked Scotland to "resolve McVitie's concerns that funding is not provided for the modernisation of production bands."
"The lack of clarity about the business needs from the plant general manager and the investment plan for Tollcross's future is deeply worrying our members.
For generations, families work here, and the workforce has been gathered in the local community and in Glasgow and its suburbs, which are the critical basis of adequate employment in a field of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Looking from the perspective of work, salary and prosperity, Brexit conditions urgently need a production of four heads of mamur in McVitie's, Glasgow's eastern tip, against increased living costs and chronic production reduction."
"The facility manager at Tollcross received a letter from Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly because we value our commitment to the workers and union representatives," said a woman spokesman from Pladis.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting in Tollcross, where several issues were clearly discussed, along with employees and representatives of the GMB.
Then, like all companies that do business in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment, we have explained to our employees that we are constantly reviewing our operations, which is valid for all our business and facilities.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in Tollcross plant, especially in production lines and operational developments.
We fully recognize Tollcross's legacy as a production facility, and in the event of any changes in our operations at the facility, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
Necip and Utku in Beşiktaş for 4 more years
Beşiktaş Club extended Necip Uysal and Utku Yuvakuran's contract for 4 years.
In the section on the website of the Turkish Football Federation (TFF), it was observed that Beşiktaş extended the contract with the two players until 31 May 2021.
Necip, who grew up in the black and white team and made his first professional contract on 19 June 2008, began playing for the A team in the 2009-2010 season.
He was born in 1991 to the captainship of the team and played a total of 254 official matches for Beşiktaş.
The TFF website also stated that the contract was signed with him until 31 May 2021 by taking the bonservi of the goalkeeper Utku Yuvakuran, which Beşiktaş hired last season.

Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about Neymar's departure?
The La Liga side may have regretted her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up Neymar after offering the offer to activate the 189 million release clause, but did they warn Barcelona to plunder the world record three years ago?
The sensational offer stirred up the summer transfer period, with the Ligue 1 team ready to break the world transfer record more than twice the previous amount of the previous amount that Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for 89 million.
With the PSG propositions a weekly salary of 500,000 pounds after taxes, it shows that Neymar will be the most expensive player in the world and also the most profitable professional athlete when the transfer is completed.
Although a source close to the Catalans' administration insisted that the club has always done the best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013, Barcelona is known to be angry about the style of the offer and Neymar's attempt to leave.
So, was the football world warned about this view three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed her interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a harsh warning to all clubs who wanted to sign one of PSG's top players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll be against them, we'll get in touch with their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, they will suffer the consequences."
Spanish club Barcelona seems to have crossed this line by expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG has declared that they will not allow the Italian national to be separated under any condition, and Barcelona feels the reflections of this interest by losing Neymar, one of the greatest values of this interest.
The penalty for preventing sala reading is broken
The defendants Kenan Gülşen and Nait Yılmaz, who allegedly tried to prevent the Imam Mustafa Baki of Küçükçekmece Gültepe Mosque, who studied Ezan and sela, were allegedly marching on the Imam Mustafa Baki, "helping the organization knowingly and willingly, while not being a member of Istanbul 22.

The delegation ordered the sentence given to Yilmaz to be converted to a fine of 6 thousand lira.
Following a judicial fine on the two defendants, the defendant's lawyers filed a appeal.
The file is being reviewed by the Istanbul Regional Court of Justice 23.
He's at the Department of Corrections.
The agency, which completed its investigations, decided that the penalty for "insult" against the defendant Kenan Gülşen was imprisoned in a legal context, the action was described as correct and the application of appeal was rejected on the grounds that it complied with the type of crime stipulated in the law, and found the penalty given against the defendant.
When the defendant Nait Yilmaz reads the sela and comes out of the mosque, he meets the imam Mustafa Baki by the High Criminal Court, "Nearly persecution, you put the people on the street."
The President has been taken.
"This is over," he said, "This is over," and that the act of walking on him and attempting to hit him has caused the victim imam to read the perpetrator and sala, which he should have to read at certain intervals, and that the crime of "resistance in order not to make the mission" occurred.
Despite the fact that the local court has stated that the act took place when the victim finished the duty of reading the flood and persecution and informing the people in front of the mosque, the agency noted that there was no duty in the concrete case that the victim had started or continued, and that it was not demonstrated and that it was judged on inadequate grounds without explaining how the defendant was able to control the acceptance that he was trying to prevent the duties he would perform later, and that he was being judged on inadequate grounds without being shown and unintentionally showing the examination of the acceptance that the victim was trying to prevent the duties he would perform later.
Explaining that the defendant was innocent and that the victim had no concrete material damage due to the crimes imposed on the defendant, the agency stated that it was not discussed whether the moral damage would not be applied to the application of the disclosure of the provision and whether it would be applied in the face of the victim's abandonment of the complaint.
The office, which saw the allegations of the defendant Nait Yılmaz's lawyer's allegations on these grounds, decided to deteriorate the verdict on the defendant and to return the file to the first degree court.
6 Europeans on Interpol's suicide bombing list
The German newspaper Die Welt wrote that Interpol (International Police Service) had a list of 173 people with the potential to commit suicide attacks on behalf of the terrorist organization ISIS last May to law enforcement agencies in European countries.
The 132 people on the list were reported to be from Iraq, North Africa, Gulf countries, Tajikistan and Bangladesh.
The six people on the list were said to be European citizens.
They are said to have come from Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Bosnia.
The person with ISIS contacts from Germany was reported to be a 27-year-old German citizen from Solingen, North Rhine-Westphalia.
It was stated that he had gone to Egypt in the fall of 2012, then to Turkey, and finally to Syria.
In mid-July, Daesh announced on social media accounts that this person had died in Raqqa.
It was noted that the German Police Department did not answer the newspaper's questions on the subject.
The names on Interpol's list were claimed to have been seized in operations against Daesh in Mosul.
According to Die Welt, the U.S. intelligence services reviewed this list and sent it to Interpol.
Interpol reportedly submitted the list to police agencies in Europe in May.
Die Welt reported that Daesh may attempt to send some of the names on this list to Europe to organise suicide bombings.
