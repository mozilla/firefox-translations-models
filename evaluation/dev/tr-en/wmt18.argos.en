Last minute: Our Cosmic Visitor Dev Asteroid 2014 JO25
There are a billions of perhaps more giant skystones, which can cause serious results in the irreplaceable and banged in the Solar System.
The way of these objects that may have closed or open orbitals remaining from the formation of the sun can sometimes pass through the Earth.
Asteroid with 650 meters from 2014 JO25 will go through the distance of 1.75 million km, which is the closest location to the world in 14:24.
The day has become more frequent.
The most important reason for this is the improvements in observation techniques and observation instruments.
In this way, we have the opportunity to determine the asteroids of smaller size that may not be determined before.
For example, in January the bus sized asteroid was just half of the Earth and Moon distance (~250.000 km).
And even more interested was able to set just a few days before the transition of asteroid.
So there may be other cosmic buses from our top.
What do you know if you get a 20-meter-wide news that asteroid will drop to the exact middle of your neighborhood?
In fact, the asteroids in this size do not destroy your neighborhood but will probably explode the glasses of all buildings.
This will also be due to shock waves emitted from asteroid that will blow in the atmosphere.
For example, in 2013, asteroid falling to Russia was in these sizes, and it was enough to break the windows of buildings in several cities.
However, if you have a neighborhood in the goal of asteroid with a diameter of 100 meters, you should go to you at least 50 km from your neighborhood.
The criteria such as the size and the angle of the Asteroid are the factors that determine the damage that the craterin depth and shock will cause.
Let’s look at several scenarios based on the simulation of the European Space Agency.
60 km per second with a 45-degree angle of asteroid with a diameter of 100 m quickly multiply to the Earth, it consists of about 250 meters deepness and a crater with a diameter of 1200 meters.
According to the Collision Richter scale, it is synonymous with 6 severity, and 3rd degree burn occurs in your body even if you are more than 10 km to the point of collision.
50 km above will be waiting for window windows shredded.
If asteroid multiplys around 1 km, then the situation gets a more internal decision-making.
With the same angle and speed value, such a asteroid multiplyes to the Earth, approximately 600 meters deep and 12 km a cryater occurs.
So the husband turns into kratere in a neighborhood and disappear instantly.
3rd degree of burn occurs in your body even if you are away from the stroke point due to the heat formed by multiplying result.
Collision is synonymous with 8 degrees according to Richter scale.
The damage to the Asteroid depends not only on the chemical composition of the asteroid, but also the rocky structure of the region.
The above values are given to the scenario that arises in a harsh rock-like asteroid from sedimentary rocks.
If the asteroid is mainly composed of iron, then the size of the crater will increase 3 times, and the catastrophe, which occurs depending on it will also be folded.
Before 66 million, a more beterous thing per dinosaurs came, and they have been exposed to a catastrophic that consists of asteroid multiplying around 10 km.
75 percent of sea and land creatures due to the asteroit crash has been instantly destroyed.
It will be to abandon the planet of the most robust option to make sure if the dinosaurs have given the goal of a large asteroid Earth.
Every day from space to the world, there are tons of substances.
Most of them are flashing in the atmosphere.
Some skystones, which are sufficiently large, are reflected in the atmosphere, causing shines known as star slip between the people.
Let’s end up with another news that will relieve our article.
Studies show that for the next 300-400 years, a giant asteroid will cause very serious destruction is not expected to strike the Earth.
The average of 70 years has relieved to get a nebze for sure that living creatures.
claim flash for Medel: 10 million euros!
Gary Medel, who wants to supplement the Stoper region, is looking at the exact eye of the Black-Whites from the name Inter in the agenda...
After wearing forma in the Confederation Cup with Chilean jersey, the 30-year-old footballer, who started working with Inter in the past days, awaits him the offers.
Gazzetta dello Sport, one of the prestigious newspapers of the Italians, said Beşiktaş for Medel, which can be served in both stoper, and front libero region, suggested that Inter offers 10 million euros.
The Black-Whites that offer Medel were indicated that the two sides of which were answered, while the Chilean footballer looked warm to live with his family in Istanbul.
Black Eagle, the FFP limit against this claim of Gazzetta, is quite difficult to pay a fee like 10 million euros for Medel.
The black-Whiteers are first in the transfer of Caner Erkin, as well as the possibility of turning to Medel or going to a serious discount on the bond.
Beşiktaş Negredo reported the transfer to the exchange
Human rights group released travel alerts for Missouri
The National Color People’s Progress Association published a warning for colorful people to travel to Missouri, due to discrimination policies and racism attacks from the state.
The statement of the group is as follows: "Missouri province NAACP Travel Recommendation Paper is valid from 28 August 2017, African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri's recent birds, due to the fact that the race-based events occur throughout the state, as mentioned there, they travel to the end of the state, and extremely cautious.  "
NAACP said that a new Missouri law makes it difficult for people to earn discrimination cases, but also the state’s law practices target minorities, the group is effective in publishing this travel alert.
"There are violations of human rights from humans.
It stops due to the color of the skin, beats and kills." said Kansan City Star to Missouri NAACP head Rod Chapel.
"We do not hear before.  "
The Association publishes such a warning for the first time for a state in the US.
The group showed examples of the death incidents of Tory Sanders, a black man at Missouri University, and a black man in Tennessee.
At the beginning of this year, after the end of the fuel passing through the state, Missouri was observed without accusation by a crime and died under suspicious conditions.
The advice also pays attention to a new report that shows that Missouri Başsavism Office is likely to stop at 75 percent than black drivers whites in the state.
Chapel said, "For people to be alerted and warn their families, friends and colleagues in Missouri."
"We should be ready to inform the relatives that they will pass from this state, so that people can bring money to the cash.  "
In Missouri, according to the latest figures in the FBI’s hate crimes report program, 100 hate crimes were processed in 2015, which is ranked 16 in terms of the figure of similar violations in the state.
Travel alert also responds to a new Missouri law, where a workplace is more difficult to proceed to a job or to discriminate while working.
Previously for the American Civil Freedom Association (ACLU) Texas and Arizona, the local executive authorities of these states had published a travel advice after the immigration arrest of people from immigration violations; ACLU says it will increase applications according to the race.
Travel alerts are often published for other countries by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but recently the groups of auctions apply to this application in response to a number of laws and trends in the US.

Referendum exit from Barzan!
Barzani made a speech at the memorial ceremony held in Duhok, the 3rd anniversary of the terrorist organization DEAŞ attacked the Ezidis in the Sincar district of Musul.
In his speech, Barzani, who mentions the independence referendum that IKBY wants to organize in September 25, expressed: "I need to specify it by timidating, we have no hope since Iraq will be a correct and uniform country.  "
We tried all ways with Iraq but we were completely desperate and desperate.
The past experience we live with Iraq brought us to this situation and there is no guarantee that we can protect and protect our rights.
That’s why we need to show that we can appoint our fate to all over the world through referendum to ensure life and safety.
I also need to draw gold; referandum is not a purpose for us but it is a tool for us to achieve greater goal.
After 2003, Baas Rejimi was demolished, Barzani said that the Iraq Central government had many promises to Kurdish, so he said that the disaster in Sincar had occurred, followed by the direct referendum decision.
Barzani said that IKBY wants to appoint the fate in peaceful and democratic way for self-protection and development of the people, "It turned out with the exceptions, Iraq does not protect or protect us like a state.  "
"We do not want our progress." defended his opinion.
During the fight against Terror organization DEAŞ, the Iraq central government does not have weapons to themselves, but in a short period, the Barzani, which immediately becomes legalized and reacts to the supply of all weapons, noted:
In the defense system of Iraq, Peshmerge was not given to the interlocutor.
The central government did not make Peshmerge, which he presented to Bodi Şabi.
Peshmerge is considered as part of the defense system of Iraq according to the constitution.
However, while there is no presence in the constitution of Bodi Şabi, all the possibilities were mobilized by chewing laws.
We don’t say that we are against Bodi Şabi.
Peshmerge and Bodi Şabi fought on the same front, causing the fact that the Peshmerge is covered with the presence and terrorism of the Peshmerge.
Here are our deep wounds with Baghdad.
Terror organization DEAŞ was attacking the Ezidis living in the Sincar district of Musul on August 3, 2014 and killing many people with them.
Backed from facia with 10 minutes
According to the news included in the BBC, the Boeing 777 type passenger plane belonging to Air France airlines was in the west of Hokkaido in the north of Japan while North Korea's missile was in the air.

The statement made from Air France was recorded that the missile was not interrupted by the route of the aircraft and there was no problem in the flight.
In the description, "The information we have at the stage of the aircraft shows that the route of the missile falls on the sea at more than 100 kilometers. were included in the expressions.
Nothing is sacred?
Trump’s White House now targets the Statue of Liberty
The most exact sign of the rejim change is that they start attacking sculptures.
Americans know the fate as much as this; nitekim, carefully loomed Saddam Hüseyin’in in 2003 in Firdos Square...
Stephen Miller, one of the keychains of the Trump regime, another with Jim Acosta from CNN, knew what he did, in a contributed discussion on the hardly restricting offerings of legal migration, while absolutely destroying the Statue of Freedom.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If it was a full boat tour owner and the Freedom impersonate of him gratitude.
But he attacked his mana and in particular, after 17 years after the monument itself was completed in 1903, Emma Lazarus’s famous poem was added to the monument base.
When Miller exits Acosta: "I don’t want to talk about the history that ends here, but Freedom Sculpture... The American freedom is a symbol of light hair.
The poem you’re talking about is then added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.  "
The shafts are really justified but as he said himself, that’s not really about history.
This seems to be that Lazarus’s creepy words are contemporary echoing, not only some older immigrants in them, but also poorly invited the poor: "Yorgun, poor, / coincculatory masses have been to breathe freedom, / I clicked on the ground of the black."
"Enjoyed unwanted" screens have never been visible.
Miller did not bring a literary criticism; this explains that people did not like Trump in the US.
The conflict about the mani of a statue is a broader political and cultural battle piece: This is actually a conflict about the man of America.
After Lazarus and his death, his friends who took the campaign to put their words into the base of the sculpture were very good.
The sculpture was intended to print connections between French and American republic and celebrate by representing Freedom with the arrival of the female body.
Lazarus changed this manayi: The female figure in the Poems was no longer abstract, there was a voice.
And it gives him a lot of names: Mother of those who are hungry.
An even feminist blow and a devastating attack against American immigration.
And as the same Lazarus changed the mana of the sculpture, they wanted to change it for a long time.
One of the Baptist John style for the arrival of Trump, Rush Limbaugh argued that Freedom in 2010 did not invite anyone inside, but it is an early rev neocon that holds more American fire to the dark world: "Women Freedom stands out.
He has freedom torch to move from the United States to the rest of the world.
Torch is not to light the way to the United States.  "
In many unusual ways, Limbaugh actually discovered something.
The man of the sculpture was completely related to the detection angle.
The magnificent creative action of Lazarus was to see it as long and mostly seen by the people full of fairness but hope.
This was really about seeing the world from the perspective of people looking for a place to fit and wanting to improve their lives.
His sculpture corresponds to them with warm welcome with hope words and needs to hear.
Of course, this is not a perspective that Miller and Trump will find in any way.
Their torch is not to show the way, but to lessen the hat with their single power supply.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle remembers only the time two Scottishs can enter the UK team
The UK Athletic performance director Neil Black says that the Scottish group "a huge contribution" of 16 people in the World Championship staff will provide.
The Scottish athlete of the gland was selected for London 2017, starting on Friday.
Black believes that in Scotland "one things are developing" and UK athletics should take lessons from it.
Black, "We are doing it and we try to figure out it and we'll work until we come out of work."
"I am talking to people in the Institute of Sports and they think they are about what they do.
Scottish Athletics think it is about what they do.
UK athletics: It thinks it is about what they do.
The man on the street in the corner is also so.
No matter what the combination of the Terms is absolutely great.  "
Laura Muir and 5000 m competes for many Scottish athletic medals including Andrew Butchart, which will compete against Sir Mo Farah, Eilidh Doyle was named as captain by the staff.
"A little low volunteer.
The captain's speech was incredible." says Black.
"Although they live or train wherever they live or are, a few athletes were very proud of that room and really motivated.
Eilidh’s passion and real feeling was magnificent.  "
The silver medalist from the Commonwealth of the Nations, who will compete in 400 m disabled in the fifth World Championship, says the 16 Scottish British team "nointed".
The best total number of athletes in Scotland’s previous world champions was seven success in 1983 and 2015.
The last year is the leader in the middle distance runner, breaking five UK and two European records.
1500 m and 5000 m.
The UK Team trials and has spent a very good season including victory in the Year's Rotate Games, another Scottish to be followed by Chris O, who run in 1500 m.
Doyle remembers the first champion that the other single Scottish in the team is Lee McConnell.
The team captain says it is "very proud" with the action that many of them will not only enter the team but in some cases it will compete for the medal and fight for the finals.
"The special addition of being the captain of the team was with votes given by other members, so already a very large tens, but the team has voted for you, and knowing that he chose you was extra private for me." He added.
"I am proud of all Scottishs entering the team.
This shows how much we take.
And they are here as athletes who arm up the podium as self-producing athletes.
When it comes to the talk of the captain?
Yes, I guess went well.
I used the fact that we are very lucky in this case, from the following care, there is a World Championship in our house.
So, in fact, we’ve succeeded in the fact that we can only benefit from this internal field support and return to the Olympic Stadium.
I catch a second chance to go and fight, and there will be a great atmosphere.  "
Prevent critics on Facebook: If you cannot remove criticisms of electorals, becoming a candidate to the state task
The father of our country had some information about the negative place in the press.
The Americans like George Washington, but the newspapers did not last too long until everything from domestic politics to political principles.
Of course, it was disturbed by criticism.
But the criticists of him were silenced.
Because in 1783 Washington, "the freedom of movement can be eliminated, and we can drag the shore in aptal and quiet way."
This brings me to Maryland governor Larry Hogan, which needs to work much more to be like Washington.
Hogan’s staff blocked and erased at least 450 people who wish their ideas on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Freedom Association also claimed him at the beginning of this week.
The staff of the Governor couldn’t care about the reason for which the case is serious, and online comments were filled with the reactions of "min umrunda?".
Many people said "This is only Facebook."
But this is important.
This is especially important when it is one like Hogan.
Ezici is a Republican guardian, which is mostly popular in a state with Democrat.
The country has the second highest rate of tasvip between 50 governors.
Hogan is not a crazy plug.
Leading to the state and showed masterity in strict commitment to principles.
After chemotherapy, it was very difficult to use Facebook as the primary vehicle to connect with the selections, with the fact that it was presented in a joker.
That’s a public forum, it’s officially defined and blocking people from the page of the valinin managed by the members of the people who paid tax dollars, unnecessary and finally dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s female spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the executions of the guardian by claiming that blocking comments is not more than editing them.
But it is very easy to use the images of trolls or spammers or hatred-filled people online oral attacks.
The Post spoke with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people talking to their chosen leaders: a teacher, a workplace owner and a priest; not trol.
All of them said that their comments are not respectful, thoughtful and mildewful.
Papaz made a quote from the Bible by addressing the Catholic belief of Hogan in sharing.
The lawyer Lakshmi Wrap Ramani from Maryland Bowie was not full of hate but asked questions about hate crimes.
In the comments section of the news of The Post "I made a disappointment that I was somehow unresponsible to his hate crimes and other nearby news."
"I also don’t like the idea that many people comment on the same topic, almost some of them, a large group of concerned citizens to ignore as a collective effort.  "
Another of the Governor’s staff called “intensified spam attack” will probably call “fikir advocacy”.
The Facebook era makes it easy to make a message fit easily through blocking a misfinal or deleting a negative message.
It is much clean than the old days that the staff is going to collect and burn the newspapers with critical articles, or to arrest protesters and water.
However, if it’s digital, it’s exactly happening.
Hogan is not the first public task that is criticizing Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is courted by Twitter users who are blocked on Twitter stream.
One of the decisions that may be referenced in the future about this issue came from Virginia last week.
Loudoun Idare District Denetmenler Chairman, USA Region Hakimi James C in Alexandria. According to Cacheris, it was illegal to the First Constitutional Change when he prohibited a selection on Facebook.
In),, Governor Matt Bevin (Cumhuriyetçi), visited by ACLU due to the use of Facebook and Twitter.
It should not be so difficult.
On the time of Washington, there was quite a similar effect on the internetink of reasonable priced mail patrol.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers was folded in the footer and the name of unknown letter writers exceeded its leadership.
Then even Washington had unknown trols.
"Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" are all written letters that take the decisions of Washington to the newspapers.
According to the online George Washington Articles Project that collects historical documents, petitions that criticize the posture on the Dispute, Trade and Seyrüsefer Agreement.
But they did not water them.
Expression is located on the basis of our nation’s most of the freedom of being plural and convergence.
The real leadership also means to accept it.

Over the past year memories are alive and my wife Sharon with me was very special to win last year.
It’s a time that we’re going to understand private and always with love.  "
After entering the age of 50 at the beginning of this year, Gary Orr, who participated in the European Senior Tour, is returning to the game in its own field.

I found the answer
Imagine a "armtuk"... Budget; with 6 billion 867 million Turkish Liras, including Economy, Development, Energy and Natural Resources, Science Industry and Technology, Environment and Urbanization, Health, Culture and Tourism Ministries are more than the budget allocated to each of the tenth ministry included!
Number of staff 117 thousand 378.
Turkey's largest "propaganda base!"
Yes, I'm talking about the Presidency of Diyanet Works!
Yes, I'm going to talk about the President of Diyanet Works Mehmet Seen!
days... I am looking for answers to the question in my head...
I wonder the real reason why Mehmet Seez is taken from the chair...
I read every article about submission.
No.
I don’t find any kind of answer to the question I’m looking for.
More this year...
Mehmet Görz prepared the Strategic Plan in 2017-2021.
1 million pounds under the President Erdoğan S 600 models were taken Mercedes.
No problem with Demek Erdoğan.
What happened?
You can say "Do not be enough for years.
First Chairman M. Rıfat Börekçi served 17 years.
Mehmet Nuri Yılmaz, who knows all of you, sat for 11 years.
So... The task time of the President is open.
I return to my question again: Why did Mehmet Not See?
Work fell...
Shii closeness
Iktidara said close source: - "According to the traditional ulema, Mehmet Dönmez did not have ehli circumcision!"
The code of this sentence is: It didn’t come out with civilization!
From the back of the person who has made this sentence: - "We found modernist by traditional ulema!"
So, Mehmet did not see innovative.
What do I mean?
The answer to the question was hidden in a foreign trip of Mehmet Görz.
Date: December 27, 2015.
Mehmet Görz went to Iran to join the 29th Vah Conference - aimed at zooming in the Islamic denominations - to be held in Tehran.
Iran’s religious leader met with Ali Hamaney.
It was prayed with the gentlemen.
And he said in the conference: "Mezhepler, representing different ideas and kanaats in the understanding of the Islamic religion, they are making five people formed over time.
The purpose of all is to determine up to God.
Each of them is in a way up to the main road, but it is the same place that they will arrive.
It can never be accepted to listen to mezhebi or to see the officer of the mezhep, above the Islamic belonging.
Mezhebe-based separation is the reflection of exposition and conflict taassubun and cehaletin.
The most damaged religion in cases where the denominations are in front of them has been in person.
Here I want to highlight again by drawing gold:
Poems and Snunciations are a single...
“Nobody can’t believe someone else’s Islam as he understands and lives.”
After a year...
The 30th Vah Meeting attended the Caferi-leading Selahattin Self-propellation from Turkey.
So...
Not Vehhabilik
Mehmet Seez’s speech in Iran and conference made him the goal of "geleneksel ulema".
He represented the Turkish State to the next Tehran conference - again - no one was involved.
I didn’t want to go for four times since it came to the task.
Sebebi was certain; Shii in DB - anti- Iran "geleneksel ulema!"
Immediately after the trip to Iran, the chair of Mehmet Seez from the beginning of 2016 began to be worn.
At the beginning of this there was Numan Kurted, the Deputy Prime Minister - responsible for the DİB!
Mehmet did not see that he asked "you connect to the Presidential of the DIB."
The essence of the work...
In the state there were differences in the view of civilization.
Theoretical worlds were created in Saudi Arabia and Egyptian metdrese, "geleneksel ulema", Sünnilik - In the US shade - Vehhabi-Selefilik was missed!
These were Iranian counters, which were not tolerated even in the trip of Tehran.
"Diyanet did not come from this dangerous.'
"Rabbim is a faithful reis nasip eylesin", connected to vatana nation and to Ehlisünnete...
"Ehlisünneti" was used as a symbol concept of Iranian enemy.
A term FETÖ made -CIA-supported- Iranian counters were now carrying out new names.
More...
A gencin photo with whiskey was served in the media with the lie of "the son of Mehmet Seen"!
Oh what coincidence!
Who did the largest opposition on the media to Mehmet Seez: the newspaper of the US guided Lighters Cemaati Turkey!
All...
- Capability resists Saudi Vehhabi-Selefi line...
- Not bellowing mezhep...
- Modernist... A man of religion was destroyed by "geleneksel ulema" created in the Cold War...
U.S. culture emperyalysis continues to make Turkey quickly Arabization (Vehhabi-Selefi).
Since the President of the Future Dialogue Works will be the Vehhabi-Selefi representative!

Don Kişot and Oblomov Truths and change has been subject to the literary world that detects or never detect.
When Cervantes's "Don Kişot" began to form burjuvazi, he is still a knight of you.
Or Gonçarov's "Oblomov" was a lazy inheritance that everything can drive like the old one when it comes to ignoring the facts.
Chinese example, when China is open to the world until the end of the 15th century and is a country dominated by seas, the holder has been closed into the result of passing the wooden of a household.
This situation is based on the procedure of the containers of the boats out of Chinese land waters.
In the West of a foot, eye and ear, the other leg, the eye and the ear are Turks in the East, we have experienced constant dilemmas in the perception of facts and changes starting from the Ottoman Empire.
We’ve tried to understand today with concepts that are old and new.
In our part, we were able to act as quickly as the focus of thought in advanced countries, as well as the change of domestic and world facts.
This was due to continuous conflicts, tensions.
With Medrese, the university was a modern army with novelty, with faith, bird encounters, causing dramatic content whisperism.
In advancement was also not considered that the new and advanced postures in a period of worse, at the end of certain periods, and they will remain behind.
After a period of time, the new and advanced "Tehlikeli", the employees who are able to comment on the current reality of the conditions of the country and the world began to declare "Hain".
The most important lesson was distributed in the Ottoman Empire at the end of being dominated by the thought and state life of those who delay the facts of the country and the world, collapsed and the people were poor.
The most important lesson that our Ottoman history is transferred to the Republic, was the fact that the world conjuncture and change is a inevitable precondition to stay up.
Since this lesson is very good, we could become the sample country of this geography, which can achieve the integrity, stability in peace, from 1st World War to date.
For a different approach, we need to go behind memors and act in harmony with facts, as we can bypass the global change process entered into the right and salim.
In other words, the meaningless camps that cause our democracy topality in the past, and no longer come to anyone who has moved their blood cases to date.
Moreover, the smallest bugs in today's world are very big and dramatic crisis.
The most problematic geography in this regard is the Middle East that we are in.

Moore’s Ford Catamaran: Activists Relive the Irkçı Linç Event For Justice Call
1948 model is a Ford Mercury, a group of viewers in the country of Monroe Georgia, and came to the small Ford Bridge in Moore.
The four black passenger and a white driver, the car, before reaching the bridge, it turned out to close the way of a armed group white man.
The middle-aged thin striped suit has a long breath from the gang-leading purosu, a man in the dress, and looked carefully from the front glass.
In the inside, the sitting people were afraid.
"We want to say, Roger!" said the man.
"Car out of her!"
A young black guy dragging from the front passenger seat, screams were passing through darkness.
Fortunately, on June 22 played this deterrent scene is only a relive.
But when the "Roger" is thrown into the surroundings of the neck, almost everyone from the audience left quite realistic.
Human rights defenders since 2005 have returned to the Ford bridge in Moore to relive two black pairs (Romanger and Dorothy Malcom with George and Mae Murray Dorsey) in 1946 by Ku Klux Klan.
No one has been accused of murder.
Tyrone Brooks, which helps to organize recreature, said: "If we see them in our tops, who know what they are, but not all these years of mind that a single person has not been arrested.  "
"This date is a spot but a load in our souls.  "
Brooks has been a member of the Congress of an old Georgia province under 71 years and advocate for human rights.
For itself, this reliferation is called a dramatic action, and it is an annual reminder that Monroe society is not corrected at all of the injustice.
He said: "We want to fight, we want to conclude, we want to be wrapped in the wounds, we want to compromise, but first we have to achieve justice.  "
"We can not have until they are yellowing and getting justice to compromise.  "
Adli is subject and put a sheet on the cesedenin of one of the victims of Ford linci in Moore on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 males were suspected from Monroe and surrounding regions.
But even one has never been asked.
And if the suspects stay leaked for decades, human rights defenders say that their twin motivations are always very well known in all over the town: politics and sex.
A high court provision in April 1946 was able to vote on the front selection at the first time of the black citizens in Georgia.
Roger Malcom, a black jointer at the same time with selection according to FBI, knives Barnett Hester, a white land owner, apparently about a woman during a fight.
Brooks expressed that he was lying in the town with Dorothy, Hester's wife of Malcom, and his carrying baby is not from her husband.
According to FBI, Loy Harrison, a leading white land in July 25, 1946, died 600$ to remove Malcom from jail.
Dorothy and kuzenler Mae Murray with George Dorsey went to a pill.
But when they came to the Ford Bridge in Moore while moving away from the prison car, a linch gang car wrapped the surroundings.
A FBI report concludes that "It is understood by the previous one, set the murders and giving the order."
"There is also a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement forces, which has not only been involved in murder, destroyed evidence and hidden the identity of etiquette.  "
Brooks spoke shorter and concise.
He said: "This was the right to vote."
"Hepsi was killed to send a message to people in this society: 'This is what you will have to register and vote.'"
Cassandra Greene for almost ten years manages to recreate Ford Bridges in Moore, which takes place every year.
Performance displays all the details, remarkable and many are now based on a deep type of racism that believes that they are not in America.
It’s hard to monitor and even harder to translate their views, but Greene says it’s the purpose.
She said: "We don’t want to talk about it because all of us face ugly in our interiors.  "
"I can't improve a relationship with you if you don't listen to me or do not listen to my head.  "
The provaes of the construction of this year began in June, and the first day, close to 30 actors (a dozen white and the rest of the black) filled in a room, and Greene listened to the desired general lines of the game.
Wade Marbaugh acts as the Vice Director of Greene.
Over the years, President played the role of Klansman, but he says that his role was never easier.
Marbaugh said: "I am not this because I feel tired.  "
"Fakat I think this past is very important to keep alive because we don’t want to return to those times.  "
The actors playing Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester throughout the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona provate their lines.
Malcom is playing with Hester where his wife is very angry for yachting with Dorothy.
"Z....i, from my property, I said!"
Rascona reacts.
There is a pounding voice.
And then everyone (at least black actors) drowns to laugh.
Most Greene rose.
Rascona asked “What?!”
He was surprised.
Is it too hard?
Greene said "No" in cartilages.
"I don't think that only once white people say...  "
One of the black players throws mixed stone with saying "Yes".
You need to press "R.  "
Thus, the energy in the room is changing and a kind of sincerity is replaced by restlessness.
Everyone is dedicated to doing this correctly, not only for the line of the game, but also for the moment of four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time says the word starting with Rascona N, sharp and highlighted.
absolutely no one laughs.
Reliferation is severely and quickly lice.
Crochet, gunfire and then have silence.
A woman who has eaten the funeral black stands on the bodies of actors and reads the "Garip Meyva" of Billie Holiday.
In one of the two words, the voice is broken.
On the face yard, an average of four dozen spectators group is fed from the eyes and tears.
The tracker is almost evenly divided into black and white.
A couple has come from New York to Ithaca to see performance, many of them are from the forward of the road.
Brooks took them on the sacred journey to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorsey, they all endured the pressure of Georgia for almost eight hours.
The murders up to this point were up to an anecdot, but now say that the lincin came to the same place as the lincin.
Greene invites the crowd for its proximity and body review while the last notes of the song are weakened.
Children do not collapse on their hands, the fake blood and inactivity bodies are roasting and whispering each other.
As a small child remembers himself, "He did not die in reality."
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd and ends multiple.
Actors throw the rope of the linch and delete their tears.
Bradshaw is wrapped in Marbaugh with a suit that plays another Klansman.
Nick Rascona wraps two of his friends and wasting ages from the eye on their arms, the emotional price of performance comes to him at the end.
One of the woman is "not sorun." He is angry.
"We know that you are in the heart of the island.
You did this for a reason.  "
Then viewers sit to eat with actors.
The white couple from Atlanta on a table is tributed to relive the black with a pair.
Denise Duplinski is forced to find words about how performance feels to him.
He said: "This is terrible, hear the sucks and he... They are out of people who like you and are doing them because they look like you.  "
"The thing he did to me is that the linch still continues," he added, "the people are now called only police armed attacks.  "
At the end of the room, Tyrone Brooks is the focus of interest in eating and telling the memories of human rights.
He said that the next year’s performance started to plan now.
She said: "The new revitalization is inspired by a care because she explains what we are folded, but also the tutorial.  "
"Sanki, if you do not take lessons from it, as can be more.
They don’t know their own past, they are convicted to repeat it.  "

İlker KARAŞ: Can be smeared into the steel
Families do not pay attention to this topic in general.
"I get my child at home or what happens."
Children communicate with many people through games.
There may be a case of borrowing a debt, or mildew.
Or he invited a person in the game to home, among which there may be problems.
There may be an effect because of the problems they live with other people who are in contact with the game, not directly from the game.
The visuality of the game can be the child's real suspect.
Intihara may be associated with drifting trauma.
If the child is facing the situation of complaining to the family, there is also the case of drifting to this.
The game itself cannot be suicide because of it.
There is also a chance to smear the child to the gang.
It can be infected with the jaw.
Individually, there is nothing that the child can do alone.
Information systems consultant Füsun NEBİL: Families should know the interaction of their children
We cannot say that the games are harmful.
Researches made also say that games are useful for the development of children.
It is important here that mother and fathers play what their children play and how they are talking with players online.
Families should take the balance of how children are affected by the contents.
There are only 2 children in 5 years, which is said to die for the game in Turkey.
This also shows that a child will end to life not only the influence of games.
What had this child pushing it?
First we must learn it.
You need to look at sociology and psychology around the child.
Exchange was based on 8 months of return in Istanbul
BIST 100 index continued its rise trend in July 2016 and moved its rise to 8th month on top.
Thus, the index has won 45,3 percent in this period while saving rise in 8 months for the first time since July 2007.
BIST 100 index, which left behind the world’s main exchanges in Germany, the United States, England, Japan since the beginning of the year, did not leave leadership on the return basis in July.
The BIST 100 index, which completed the July month by 7,06 percent, followed the FTSE 100 index in the United States with an increase of 2.54 percent.
Nikkei index in Japan with DAX index in Almaya completed the month of July with value loss.
BIST 100 index was seen as of January-temphanage period, showing a high performance from both major world exchanges and emerging country stock indices.
According to this year 2016 closing, 37,6 percent worth winning BIST 100 index, 10,76 percent increase with Dow Jones index, 5,55 percent value gain with DAX index, 4,55 percent rise, followed Nikkei index, FTSE 100 index with 3,21 percent increase.
MSCI EM index, an indicator on the emerging country exchanges, provided 23 percent return.
BIST 100 index was seen in the past as well as similar performances.
The last December 2006 to July 2007, completed the BIST 100 index by winning 8 months in a row, recorded 38,3 percent in this period.
In addition, BIST 100 index had completed 8 months from August 1996 and March 1997, 9 months from May 1997 to January 1998 by winning value.
Eren Can Ümüt, Managing Director of Mesa Investment Research, noted that the BIST 100 index continued to rise for 8 months, noted that the rise has increased 37 percent since the beginning of the year.
Ümüt noted that the MSCI has recorded 23 percent of the developing markets (EM) index, even when we look at these proportions, it is positive decomposition:
Fund flow to emerging countries continues since the beginning of the year.
Especially in search for high returns, funds prefer higher interest countries.
In this case, domestic markets are positively affected.
Of course, risk taking appetite on a global scale is also high.
In this way, the stock indexes in the status of a risky asset are rağbet.
In the US, we see S&P 500 index has been tested almost every week in parallel to record a close increase in 11 percent since the Christmas.
At the beginning of Sene, the U.S. Center Baka (Fed) 3 interest increase predicted markets stressed, but Ümüt noted that the Fed’s oral routing policy eliminates uncertainty using quite good, has found an unintentional market.
Ümüt expressed that the inflation in the US is not yet desired, the Fed will not rush in interest increase and the expectations of radical moves will be quite effective in existing pricing.
Say that the U.S. President Donald Trump can not cancel the health reform, known as "Obamacare", strengthens the perception that the broader financial policies will not fulfill their promises," Ümüt said, "How much Trump, thanks to the faster-growing US economy shares the stock markets in a period of positive influence, but in terms of the response to the faster growth and faster inflation, Fed strengthens the hand of the market in this context.
Ümüt said that in terms of the markets of Turkey, in terms of 2016, it was a year inhabited by many negativeities, negatively discrete and excessively sold BIST 100 index was in the effort to close the difference between them.
Ümüt reported that they do not see a strong recovery with domestic source news flow, noted that the current appearance can be interpreted in the trigger of the desire to close the difference between the similarities of domestic markets with the increase in the risk of getting more overseas.
Ümüt noted that in the BIST 100 index, which technically tested new records with 108.600 levels, followed by some profit sale:
Especially 109.500-110.000 region is a critical partner in short run.
After approaching these levels, the realization of profit sales is normal.
We believe that a local or global new story should be formed for pricing over 110.000 in the short term.
Now it can trigger profits sales to pass down to 107,500 support.
In this case, I think it can be seen to relax up to 106,000-105.500 area.
Specifically, 105.500 support can bring back withdrawal to 104.300 levels, which is divided into 50 percent of the rise from 100,000 to 108.600 levels.
Ümüt stated that both the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) decisions will be at the focus of the global market, the expectations for the Fed are now certain, but if interest increase in September FOMC is unexpected, he said that the ballet  programının program can trigger power on US dollars.
Ümüt states that this condition may trigger profits sales in the stocks of the developing country (GOU) in the short-term overtake shadow, and what is important next to the "Bin next to the ECB will tell you what is.  "
After the July money policy board meeting, the President of ECB Mario Draghi expressed the course of the money policy to discuss in the fall, and this said that the euro/dolar parity increased over 1,1700 levels.
So the explanations on whether the monthly 60 billion euro asset trading program can be reduced or terminated will mean that the post-Ferity on the global scale will also be reduced by the ECB.
"Without Turkey, high car rental and foreign fund access may lead to negative pricing on behalf of country markets which are mandatory. Reviews.
Erol Gürcan, Director of Gedik Investment Investment Consulting, also stated that in November 2016, he had a rather serious ralli in terms of global stock markets after selecting Trump in the US.
Gürcan stated that the main element that triggers this rally movement is that Trump is able to tell that it is possible to say that it is possible to increase global growth expectations, primarily for tax discounts:
Exchange Istanbul has also been ranked at the beginning of the exchanges leading in global rally.
One of the most important reasons for this is the fact that the BIST 100 index is quite incontoluted compared to the developing country markets in recent years, it is also useful to say that the steps taken in the direction of supporting economy and financial markets by policymakers have played a serious role.
In particular, we can say that the Credit Guarantee Fund (KGF) index, which has become active with the reputation of March, is a serious effect on the rise observed as far as the main.
In the rest of the year, Gürcan said that the positive developments are significantly reflected in pricing, and that has a significant role in this rise, the UPSF has gradually reached the dodium, while BIST 100 index continues to stay incontolu compared to similar country markets, although the search for a new story for the remaining period of the year could gradually come to the forefront.
Gürcan has noted that the 180-day action plan, which is particularly expected to share the details for some time, as the increase of the limit of the Credit Guarantee Fund, the company can provide positive contributions in this sense of improvements such as possible tax discounts from the agenda recently.

New results of Swedish yaşı age assessment test were announced
The latest results of evaluation tests of refugees, which are subject to a new medical age assessment method in Sweden, ruled that more than 80 percent of those participating in the test are older than 18 years, but not everyone trust the accuracy of these tests.
Swedish national Adli Medical and Drug Administration (Rättsmedicinalverket), tests began to do earlier this year.
The tests were designed to make age assessment more accurate in the sürecinde process after the elimination of failures in evaluation of certain refugees claiming that Sweden Migration Office (Migrationsverket).
To date, Migrationsverket sent 6880 cases and Adli Medical and Drug Administration currently announced the outcome of the total 2481 of the period from March to 31 July 2017.
It was ruled that the 80 percent (2002 agestion) is 18 or above, in 25 cases, Adli Medical and Drug Administration ruled that the "muhtemelen 18 and above."  "
The result in 432 cases was "under 18" of the person.
The tests were performed only in cases where the age of the person is suspicious.
Based on Johan Göransson from Adli Medical and Drug Administration, results are consistent with past months.
To The Local, "We don’t see a big difference in statistics according to the past months, the figures are quite consistent."
The ratio of cases dominated by the age of 18 is not necessarily lying about the age of refugees.
In May, the apartment announced the result of 581 tests and said that "people who have been examined are 18 years old or older" is 442 status.
When the Swedish Dagbladet newspaper examined the results of the 581 case, 243 cases clearly found that this year entered 18 years.
The medical age evaluation method, which includes taking the x-ray of 20 years teeth and MRI screening of knee joints, then analyzing them to dentists and radiologists, is criticizing in some circles.
One of the birds is Karolinska Institute endocrineologist Claude Marcus, who evaluates the biological maturity of people who have been working as soon as possible or later on to this age.
"I have the reasons to think about this and I think it should not be that such measurement used.
Biological age is very suspicious to decide in this way.
If we don’t say precisely, we must do it as if you haven’t said. He said to the Metro newspaper.
What’s, Adli defended the accuracy of Göransson tests from the Medical and Drug Administration: "You can generally say that a child is incorrectly dominated by an adult.
The biggest risk is just under the age of 18, in this case the risk is around 10 percent.  "

15 July, Ermut, who transferred that there is no reduction in investments because of the FETÖ pulse attempt, "It would be more increase, hit the ket.  "
Perhaps if these terms occur, we could see a more increase with multiplier effect, if there are no regional developments.
We hope more for the next year.
Buildllah will be a brighter year in terms of direct investment.
As of the first 5 months, we are going to increase 11 percent by the first 5 months of last year.
But we do not find it enough.
"We hope to be more." used expressions.
"The global, no matter whether regional developments," said Ermut said that they have tried to diversify investors.
Ermut said that 75 percent of direct investments from 2010 came from Europe, and continued their words as follows:
This figure dropped to 66 percent.
Again the share of Asia from 2 percent to 7-8 percent.
The share of Russia increased.
We went out some problems among the Gulf countries while trying to do so.
Turkey has good relations with all; especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar two important actors.
But the problem between these two countries is getting out of us and in its way, it allows investors to postpone their decisions slightly more.
Not only in terms of investments in Turkey, but we may have some delays.
Arda Ermut understood that there were some events in Germany last week but the government, especially the President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan showed clear and precise reaction to this situation.
When the most harsh political crisis talks about the investors of the country, the reaction of President Erdoğan, "The problems of the patient are among governments, among the people will certainly not.  "
Secondly these people have invested in my country.
There is no difference from Turkish companies for us.
They will come to us when they are the slightest problems on the contrary, we will solve it.
"We will not allow them to be victims." Ermut, who wished that they continued to support all investors with the comfort of them.
Ermut, "We can guarantee this during our period.  "
You’ll see what German companies, nor investors from countries where we live some problems politically in any way may not be able to experience annoyance.
We will do our best at the point of increasing investments from these countries.
We think that investments from here will continue to increase.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect the perceptions of investment environment.
"We will do our best with the goal that our investors are not affected by our investment environment perception. Reviews.
TYDTA President Ermut, after a single-generation single-way strategy, he said that Turkey began to see great interest from China, but if problems in the Gulf are resolved, the biggest investment would expect from the Gulf.
"In the relations with Germany, 'We had troubled for these relationships, because of this incident we had investments, we don't even have investors who say "we'." Ermut, who uses their expression, noted that they are from, coming, and following companies.
Ermut, "At present, 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are close to German companies.  "
That’s what we’ve seen from all over the world, almost 10 percent of the German companies.
Some of them are companies with investment in Turkey.
The man will grow his investment or have an issue, which stands open as a project.
"German companies actually create a significant part of our daily workflow." He spoke.
Ermut highlighted that all government institutions should be careful when their perception operations were made in Turkey, expressed that the subject is sensitive and can be affected by a slightest bad communication.
Ermut stated that the following 2-3 weeks are a good lesson, said:
It is always different from the agenda of political people with investors.
We’ve always seen that; economic relations always make political developments sit on a nevi path.
Germany will continue to stay as an important business partner and an important investor.
Because there are a lot of investments in Turkey.
The choice in Germany increases my agenda, unfortunately, such phrases.
I think they will go on a little more way.
In Saudi Arabia’s private, two countries pay attention to making negative explanation.
A investor investing in Turkey in Neticede invests by targeting all the environmental country markets.
So it was not because of Saudi Arabia but there were some slowing processes due to uncertainty in the region.
But we still have interviews with these investors.
My personal opinion, investors perhaps expect a decision to get faster at the moment.
 ' I see uncertainty due to the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia in the negative sense, here’s no Saudi investors.
On the contrary, we have Saudi investors, which still continues to live in Turkey, while doing the holiday here, we discuss with us and follow all the processes.

How will football go to Neymar's Paris?
Rules for the prevention of unlimited spending of European football clubs Neymar will not block the world record transfer from Spain to Barcelona to France’s Paris-Saint Germain.
The prestigious Champions League can result in all kinds of management units from UEFA to Paris Saint-Germain.
Financial Fair Gaming rules released by UEFA in 2011 mean that at the end of PSG, Neymar will have to show his transfer without experiencing huge losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros (262 million $) to purchase the secret Brazilian outside the contract, and Neymar will rule tens of millions of dollars per year.
Some financial aspects of Neymar to France are:
Given the benefit from the Ukrainian family, the rich of energy, the PSG will sign Neymar, and of course you can pay the money that will add it to the galaxy of other stars.
Clubs are allowed to spend money installed to get players, but they have to balance it with legitimate sources of income with the record they come to cope with football related work.
FFP was designed by Michel Platinumi after the selection of UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that the clubs suffering from major debts in pursuit of success are effectively fraudulent, and if banks or owners attract their support, they were at risk of bankruptcy.
In 2011, FFP began to monitor the harm of clubs instead of concentrating on debts.
The change meant that the Roman Abramoviç was first used in Chelsea in 2003 (take a club with the exception, do high spending to improve the team and create a global brand) to turn into a more difficult attempt.
During the 3 years FFP evaluation period, which continues to 2018, clubs can be damaged by 30 million euros.
Despite the fact that Platinum is dissatisfied from the president in 2015, it is still stable in the fact that Aleksander Ceferin is still unfamiliar in its UEFA.
Andrea Traverso, managing FFP in UEFA, last week to Associated Press: "FFP did not die strictly and we will surely strengthen the rules by moving forward."
Although PSG Neymar will pay the purchase agent in bulk, it may emit the amount to the contract period due to accounting reasons.
Neymar signed a 5-year agreement, so the transfer fee can be shown as a cost of 44,4 million euros in the annual accounts of the next 5 years.
The first wave FFP auctions in 2014, saw the implementation of the most severe individuals in Manchester City, which is owned by PSG and Abu Dhabi.
PSG was sentenced to 60 million euro (82 million $ for time) which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and for the 2014-2015 season the Champions League team was normally impregnated with 21 players instead of 25.
UEFA is indict to clubs that can attempt to cheat financial regulators by inflated income through companies connected with club owners.
Although a Qatary company can sponsor PSG, if it is thought that the value of the sponsorship exceeds the standard market values, the UEFA will not allow it to be considered a right income.
In UEFA 2014, Qatar Tourism Authority ruled that PSG sponsorship was inflated.
A part of the earnings from Neymar’s PSG was reported that Qatar can come through payments of the 2022 World Cup organization committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied Neymar’s World Cup ambassador and can be easily revealed by such a movement UEFA regulators.
The sanctions applied to PSG in the past mean that UEFA will be more careful against the trials of skipping rules.
According to what the foundation is on Tuesday, UEFA is not in a preventive interview with PSG on the transfer of Neymar.
Since they are not authorized to speak the status of PSG, they spoke to The Associated Press, provided to stay confidential.
The last published accounts show that more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542,4 million euros in PSG 2015-16.
The accounts of the last financial year were not yet published.
PSG expects Neymar to contribute to sponsorship deals, gift and forma sales.
The club expects to increase at least 30 percent of the turnover after the signing is taken.
The Spanish League, which is clearly disturbed from one of the biggest players of the football, tried to block Neymar's departure with the claim that PSG violates FFP.
The head of La Liga Javier Tebas Spanish newspaper AS said, "This is a case of an open ‘mali doping with the club and the state."
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, owned by an American sport devine, share his concerns about financing La Liga by a state.
Wenger Thursday "This is a result that it has brought, and in the last 15 years, it completely changed the entire floor of football."
"Every country is possible when a hut has once.
It is very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because it can cause a country to have different methods or different interests to represent a country of such a large player.
From Insurances to 'sell price'
According to TSB data, the insurance sector has been damaged since 2006.
In 2015, the sector damaged by TL 2.35 billion, acquired only 19 million TL profit in 2016.
In Stock Exchange Istanbul, Anatolia Insurance and Solar Fuse trading.
In the meeting where TSB’s first six-month results were evaluated, Çağlar said that the 11-year damage in traffic insurance reaches 7.3 billion TL, the damage of the sector with the ceiling premium application said that the estimated damage-prim ratio was estimated to 125 percent.
The Ages that say that this year will be captured by 2015, pay attention to the profits of other branches of damage written in 2012, and 2015, "This means that this means; we also increase the price of the housing policy of the citizen by financing the bad driver.  "
" 75 percent of the vector is foreign, our partners abroad also funded the evil driver in a sense."
Ages continue:
We don’t have profit expectation from traffic but we don’t show that we’ve been profitable for no years.
"We also accept that, but in a reasonable environment, we continue our hope to carry together with other policies."
The Ages that say that the damage on the traffic is dramatic price increases when it takes the profitability of other products, "There was a price rises around 30 percent in traffic insurance in 2012. In 2015, we almost doubled, we wrote the biggest harm of our history.  "
"Our profit at the end of 2016 was only 19 million TL" even in an environment where prices rise.
The Ages that say that they wait for the next year to pass the free tariff, "We will drop the price of the good driver in the free tariff and apply high price to the bad driver.  "
"However the Treasury looks at the general round, when it will be the last promise in the Treasury."
The Treasury Consistency was passed in the implementation of the maximum premium (tavan price) from April 12, by specifying that the rise in mandatory traffic insurance premiums from 2015 affected a large part of the society.
Accordingly, the maximum premiums for mandatory traffic insurance policies were determined on the basis of mandatory traffic fuses on the basis of the groups of vehicles determined by considering accidents statistics and traffic density.
On the other hand, the "Risky Fuses Pool" application was implemented for high-digit or vehicle groups in compulsory traffic insurance as of July.
Premium and damage to traffic insurance policies under the pool will be shared between insurance companies.
The premium of these fuses will be determined by the Treasury Auction.
Ages said that in the traffic with the implementation of the ceiling premium, in the first 6 months of 2017, the premium production of premium production decreases 11.5 percent according to the same period of the previous year, the number of policies increased by 4.9 percent, the inflation also reported that the discount on the traffic policies reached about 30 percent.
The Ages say that this year traffic will still take profits in other branches, "This can not be damaged at ceiling prices.
That’s how much the damage industry can carry?
The capital of all companies in the sector is 9 billion TL, while only 2.3 billion TL of traffic is damaged, the Ages that say that the capital of the sector will be finished in three years, "The good driver of the fire is financed the bad driver, why my thousands of shares the bad driver in Turkey?'s look at.  "
"At this point we try to tell our grandfather to the Treasury."
After these developments, the Ages on a question that foreigners come to the point of weight reduction in the Turkish insurance sector, "They do not come to that point.  "
They are waiting for more investments in Turkey because while the average 6 policy per person in the Netherlands falls, this 1.3 in Turkey.
"A place where Turkey should grow in real sense" said, and continued:
So they don’t leave here.
However, the company is using it for the growth of the company by leaving the entire profit, although it has a reasonable profitability every year.
According to TSB data, in 2016, the production of premium in the sector was 40.5 billion TL, this year’s first half of the year was reached as 23.1 billion TL with 12 percent increase in the same period.
Ages said that the industry will not complete with 15 percent growth in total premium production.

Nostalgia, "Happy Hot American Font" and "Yoldaş Detective"
Thanks, for the bright days in 80s of the characters, for the period of grunge in the 90s (the time they did the "The State" for the vignette for the MTV of brains such as David Wain and Michael Showalter) and for that of 2001, the stars Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd before they continue with larger things, this version of the story is nostalgic for all.
As a cultural product, this is both the tiling of our permanent memories Facebook era.
But as a series, as if the duration has been exhausted.
"Kampin First Day" was unexpectedly successful, and this was not only thanks to absurt humor (in the interior, H. Jon Benjamin was a story about the origins of a speaking box plant. Home
Intensifying the basic funnyness (playing children from the mid-aged actors) made it impossible to retrace the part of the joke in the past.
Now that adults play adults "On Years After" with less emotional basis and including monolog about the perverted follower film, such as "Beşiği Sallayan El", parodisi is more random.
Character at one point; a Apple Powerbook mixes some single row wheel skates and a lot of other things from "1991".
Many of the basic stories are the same.
Soft hearty Coop (Bay Showalter) no longer a writer, still did not forget Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still lost his virginity.
George H. W. There is another wild hain plan that Ronald Reagan (a very well-groomed imitation by Michael Ian Black) mixed by Bush.
The best part of the series as usual words.
Especially Matt Dillon has a lip six beard in the "Bekarlar". It’s very nice to see Rudd, which is the most popular child of the old school Andy, now it looks like a moruk.
There may be random delicacy moments that give power to this series (the series of "Seven Up!" that repeats a kind of "Seven Up!") until I think it is my logical result: "Wash Hot American Font: After Twenty Years" it is provided to see the premiere of the film "Happy Hot American Font".
By the way, "Yoldaş Detective" in Amazon caters to a different type of nostalgia: "The Americans"'s Cold War resurrection, the movie "Sarray Bomb" and even the East "GLOW" with iconography against Western wrestling.
Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Created by Tanaka, Rhys Thomas did not come to manage, it seems to have TV: A 1980s that two Bucharest police officers struggle for the real, atheism and Marksist-Leninist road Rumen police friends drama.
Başroller wolf Gregor and idealist Iosef are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogues are made by English dublaji Channing Tatum (both also the head producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
This is a very bright idea.
But not much more than this idea.
There are some nice visual funnyities (the Americans are spending time watching football on TV by watching chess)
There is also a good material for the "who knows" game, of which there is Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny among them.
But "Yoldaş Detective" is called itself so that a secret propaganda drama resembles reality (including a killer wearing a reagan mask), mostly plays exactly like him.
It does not know to pass six long sections, and it is not enough quickly or often.
Gregor and Iosef have always visited the American ambassadors with two fats of hamburgers, such as hungry wolf in the lobby, while "Yoldaş Detektif" could bring the propaganda hicv better if shortened to a narrower length.
The dream komünist watcher message can turn to eat anything from the Western culture as a series.
Kurmaca Rumen Creators were not unfair: We do this in our close history and even to them.
FETÖ’s horse riding
As a result of the years of experience in the British Government, we have seen that our family and sister.
The senior authorities of the government have agreed that this family has been sincerely connected to the British Government since the other, and in large services.
The British government’s own hands are smart and careful acting about this physique, thoroughly researching everything and deciding carefully.
When trying to figure out FETÖ, the organization of the bogotiations as the starting point is addressed, but remembering a difference is that FETÖ is a organization that arises in the period of emperyalist and moves with colonist saiks.
This is the ‘front movement’ which should be addressed in the minval.
In the British praise in the entrance, the person who defines himself as "the British Government's hands" is Mirza Gulâm Ahmet Kadiyânî, founder of Kadiânîlik.
Gulâm Ahmed, born in Kadiyân, a small town of the province of Pencap of India, said, "1 December 1888, God has taken him from his fans, and impeding a separate congregation.  "
Gulâm Ahmed is a bit more advanced in 1891, he received by vahiy and inspiration. It said that Mary died with a death, such as other nephes, God sent him himself to mesîh and mehdî, where Christians and Muslims were expected.
According to this, the same person with mesîh, where Muslims expect, is Mirza Gulâm Ahmed Kâdiyânî.
(Advanced Encyclopedia, TDV)
1857 Gulâm Ahmed, who wrote books against the Hindu and Hrisitiyans, in India, who entered completely under the British disability after the sipahi footing, reminds the Gülen portrait, who defended the Islâm against dynamism with the Presidency of the Communist Society of Combating the Communist in Erzurum, which arises from the support of CIA.
Like the same Gülen, Gulâm Ahmed’s most loved idea of emperyalists is that the Muslim "cihad" is not a size to fight the impperyalysis, if you can freely live his religion and live his religion.
Even if you remember, a step further, the wound in our history was still praised in a ‘vaase’ in the past year, even the attacks of the Crossed Crossed Crosses: "It is not very dangerous to occupy your country.
Because there are red lines between you and them.
Once they aren’t going to your woman, daughter.
Mabedinze does not exist, unfamiliars!
The thought that Mehdi and civilization combines in itself, the idea that its congregation will be the liberator of Islâm, as it means that the concept of cihad is only the palatic struggle, the similarity of thesis with FETÖ, the way of spreading the Kadiânîlik also carried out in the field of education and civil society in general.
 ' The number of nations said that the number of the nations exceeded 2 million, the number of total centers in the world are 1869, "Humanity First" and the number of countries in which the emergency aid organization was officially registered in 23.
In 12 countries 36 hospitals, 650 dispanser in 55 countries, only 8 printing belonging to the Kadiyânîs in Africa; in 11 countries there are 505 educational institutions and about 16,000 mosques in the world.
"First Muslim scientist" Prof. Nobel Prize. Sir Zaferullah Han, President of the United Nations Court of Justice, said that "Muslim actor" Mahershala Ali, who received the first Oscar prize, is also the Kadiyânî, and we can see the depth of the approval of global powers to the Kadiîs.
Let's note that the women's meeting in the UK with 30,000 people in the last week, as a body show.
One of the Slogans is a short view to the dates to understand that the Messengers of the "Do not hate everyone," actually want to say "love your friends/trainers."
Hülasa is possible to drive the exit point and motivation of the executions such as FETÖ or Tahir-ül Kadri and all of these organizations are actually supported as ifsadmaya matuf to serve colonialism.
"last desire" from the courier
Emily Pomeranz, who spent their last days in a hospital in Washington due to pancreas cancer, expressed his craving to a coffee and chocolate mixture milkshake (sweet drink) of a restaurant in the country where she was born.
A friend of the woman contacted Tommy's restaurant.
Tommy Fello, the same restaurant for 47 years, put the drink dry buza and sent it to the hospital "fast delivery" cargo, which is 600 kilometers from paying the fee of $123 (435 TL).
Two new projects from Ahmet Kul
To date, Ahmet Kul Construction, which has launched important projects such as Lavinya Park, Autoport, Vetro City, Ginza Lavinya Park, has sold 7 projects in Istanbul Architectoba, Dia Mare, Bodrum Yalıkavak.
The geometry of the Dia Mare project developed by Çamoğlu Architecture was developed to get maximum benefit from the sea.
Located on an area of 11 thousand square meters, Dia Mare is a total of 188 residential and 17 commercial units.
The rough structure will be fully completed in March 2018 to be delivered to new owners.

Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0,25%
After reducing the speculation that the Bank of England will be a slow economic growth and an increase of the inflation, interest rates are expected to change.
Bank of England warned that the economic growth will continue to continue with the narrowing of family revenues.
The decision-makers in the Bank’s Parasal Policy Committee (MPC) used 6 votes to keep interest by 0,25%, so they wanted less members increase this month after slow economic growth is weakened.
The bank pulled the growth forecasts in the three-month inflation report to 1.8% in 2017, 1.9% in 2018, 6%, and warned that the inflation still increases to 3% in the spring.
However, in the next few years, interest increases have given the sign that Brexit is necessary to string inflation, and said that the borrowing costs can remain in the case of increased more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted in the direction of withdrawing some of the huge economy healing package, which was launched in a year ago after Brexit.
The bank will end the Periodic Funding Plan, which offers cheap financing to banks from the next February, but in the framework of the plan, it said that it was expected to offer £15 billion (total 115 billion).
After minutes from taking interest decision, the bank said: "The central forecast of the MPC, the gay pure domestic harvest (GSYH) continues to be gradually in the short run, with the continuation of the contraction of domestic real incomes.  "
In Faizler, he stressed that a amount of contraction in the "money policy" would be necessary to relieve inflation and "one piece is higher" as the market is expected.
The market estimates that the first increase of the market will be in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
But the bank emphasizes that each increase will be "stepping" and "limited".
According to estimates in May, this year of the bank and reduced growth forecasts in the next year are compared to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The Bank protects the estimate of 1.8% in 2018.
Pound lost value against the dollar and euro after the news.
Pounded by 0,5 by 1,31 US dollars and 0,4% by dropping 1,11 euros.
The decision to change came after the reduction expectation of the final growth figures that make disappointment by 0,3% in the second quarter of the GSYH.

Former Industry and Trade Minister Ayhan Çilingiroğlu's daughter born in Washington, Ümit Makbule Çilingiroğlu (51) lost his life by dropping down from 19th floor of a business center used as a hotel in Istanbul Levent.
24-year-old Melis Salihoğlu, a student of Koç University, was dead at home.
Salihoğlu’s self-assemblance.
Two secret deaths were started to be considered suicide by police and police.
'DEPRASIF HOOD'
The first Industrial and Trade Minister Ayhan Çilingiroğlu in 1966, the daughter of Ümit Makbule Çilingiroğlu, born in Washington in 1966, entered Le Meridien Hotel in Etiler at 17.00 pm on August.
On the 19th floor, the incident was called the ambulance and police team instead of the incident on the informing of a Kuwaity tourist, which was located in the room and received a while from him.
The health team determined that Çilingiroğlu lost his life from 19th floor to hard ground.
The mother Mediha Çilingiroğlu, who expresses the police, had a depressive state.  "
On July 31, Ankara came to Istanbul.
I have a grandchildren from my other daughter.
"This was interested in torunum and negatively affected by the disease of the grandma."
Cenazesi is expected to be buried in Ankara by Çilingiroğlu, which was removed from the Adli Medical Authority.
Çilingiroğlu is researched by someone or whether it is suicide.
'CANINA KIYDI'
Another suspicious death in Istanbul was born in Sarıyer Zekeriyaköy.
Melis Salihoğlu, who studied at Koç University, was dead in his house (24).
The father of the young girl, according to the Iddia, went to the house near the school of the girl, which was not able to get news and reach from the cell phone.
The father met with the lifeless body of the girl at home.
The family was forwarded to her life by her close surroundings and friends.
Melis Salihoğlu’s death family and closes of law.
After Melis, a friend went on to our social media, "A sparkling sun face.  "
The lush grasses under our feet, the best-friendly Jack and sister with Eyşan, it was in place where we enjoy the pursuit of the small plastic ball.
"What had to do now he shared his message to death."
Living in luxury life: Vine floor and smart design numbers transformed this small Earls Courts apartment into a spacious home.
The former banker Joanne Leigh, who is a passion for real estate renovation, went to shrink by crossing the apartment in Earls Court from a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014.
The show Queen Anne style is a proof of the new design, which is convinced of a scan on the first floor and without collecting Joanne’s suitcases.
"I've been living in a much larger area in Knightsbridge before this." Joanne says.
"I was looking for something that coincides with my price.
The apartment in Earl Court showed me and had the same high ceilings.
I was in love with him and I gave him a quote.  "
After the first sight, the 1000ft squared circle was renewed down from the beginning.
Initially a one-room and complex planned property; it was necessary to pass through the kitchen to reach the bedroom. Joanne asked to add a storage space and a vine floor to benefit the maximum of generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows and very light.
This was my condition.
For this purpose, the architecture and design studio based on Notting Hill kept Erfan Azadi from Duck & Shed from 12,5 ft ceiling and not only a structure but also for creating a place where Joanne will live.
The ceiling was not sufficiently high to add two areas in the row, so the architectural difficulty was to create a hanging floor that you can stand in.
Erfan was creatively thought to solve the issue.
"Steel skeleton is quite complex." He explains.
"We were able to bend them down to each other without needing bending down.
This was not just to build a simple platform, but also the steels were so leaning, they would be at the right height according to the function at the top or bottom.  "
This arrangement has provided Erfan to achieve two full size rooms on each other by bringing many additional dramas.
Old type copper light window taken from Retrouvius for hanging floor, looking at the magnificent living area below.
Mirrored gold color furniture, silver accents and old type Serge Mouille light all determines the style of the design.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of space and light.
Mirrors placed on both ends of the short corridor make it look longer.
The mirrored guard panel in the kitchen gives a sense of window opened in another room.
Antrede mirrored units provide Joanne all cutlery and storage space.
The beauty of the living room, which creates a more magnificent space perception, can grab the kitchen when it is not in use.
The populated kitchens are not new.
It’s a garage-style up-lifted door.
Erfan, steel-powered polished MDF door, "We used some engineering." He explains.
"There is a weight of the door so it really easily boils when you push the door up.  "
With the intelligent use of space and storage space, Joanne has gained additional 16 square meters, an extra bedroom and a improved session plan.
"What is going to sell the session area at the end of the year, or the value of your property is determined." says Erfan.
"As Iptidai, a real estater will enter inside and will make an calculation on the site basis.  "
Here they managed to use quality materials that give the look of luxury while increasing floor space.
Erfan is the objects that you touch "Malzemeler and thus helps you build emotional bond at home." He says
"You will not fall in love with the electrical lines on the wall.
These are important but it does not vibrate the wires of your heart.  "
This proves that a circle through good design and increased square meter can turn into something quite spectacular than a standard one.
In fact, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.

Sisters fight for $500 million property empire
Two brothers battle for one of the largest real estate empires of Victoria, which has more than $500 million, after nine years from the household that Italian families have established.
The former Carlton Football Club director and contractor Colin De Lutis live three doors away from Paul, a ficanede in Toorak, how to share properties and business assets.
Paul wanted to go out of the family business since 2014, but hard discussions were continued in the Supreme Court concerning fragmentation.
Together with Anna, brothers Smith Street, Collingwood have more than 38 property owners, which have more than half billion dollars that have been accumulated since a shop in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and raised him into a chain with 160 retail outlet centers.
Sold to $85 million in 1999.
This currency was credited to the property and the portfolio of De Lutis currently contains city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento contractors, Gold Coast and Mt Buller Apartments and shopping centers in the suburb.
Within the scope of an agreement with the fathers who have been defeated, Colin (which is described as a "prepared driving force and dominant personality" in the De Lutis family byPaul) has two of the company assets, Paul has one third one.
A court file says that Colin has $316 million, Paul’s property worth 176 million.
The property for Paul and the knockdown is revealed as a traction topic.
In 2015, the first sworn phrase he gave to the court was written as follows: "They were divided by Colin, leaving him with properties that I always add as the best.  "
The first High Court trial was made after the mediation, which suffered many failures.
Brotherhoods also fight against who will control the current work; Paul claims that Colin left himself outside the work.
Colin argues that this is not true, but Paul is guilty to manage some property without skill.
Colin says he hopes to solve the dispute in a sworn expression that he gave in the beginning.
"My mother's roots planted me that the family is the most important priority."
In Deloitte, Hundreds of page feeds, e-mails, and Allan Myers, the best lawyers such as Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, are growing in the case along with senior law supervisors held by both sides.
Lady De Lutis and her husband Luigi was a family of Italian immigrants from the end of the 1950s and nurserys, and at the beginning of 1970s they bought a shop in Brunswick.
Colin’s first jeans store of the family reindicated their goods to purchase Collingwood property.
Colin says that in my recent years, Paul founded Westco in a small child (10 years)" there.
Anna De Lutis says that he hopes to leave his own goods in a friendly way to his sons.
"Luigi told me that the brothers often did not want to fall into the court." He wrote.
Other two brothers Mark and Luke are no longer part of the De Lutis group; 10 million $ to Mark when Colin said, Luke also paid $26 million.
According to Paul said, both Luke and Mark were unhappy with the terms of the "financial separation."  "
According to the biography of Eddi McGuire, the best friend of the TV star, Colin tried not to pay attention, although it is an old AFL club board member.
Fairfax Media was contacted on Friday with Colin and Paul De Lutis and lawyers.
Just because Colin is in case court with a short message, "I don't say anything with it." He replied.
"My brother Paul was very sad to choose to claim me and drag the name of our family into courtesy." He wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote that he tries to fulfill the demands of his brother for a court.
"We did not want to fall to Paul and my current dispute." He said, "I still hoped about my word."
On Friday, this hope looks like lost.
Colin wrote "Our head will be solved by courts in the near future."
Trump’s new private pen plans to restrict the media diet of another.
Others have tried and failed.
John F. Kelly can really do it.
It is the first.
Politico reports that the new White House special pen will restrict the information flow to President Trump (including news media reports), the boss to the hope of keeping it more stable.
Some little information from Josh Dawsey:
"New special pencil of White Saray John F. When Kelly met with senior staff on the first day in the business, he summarized a fundamental problem that President Donald Trump plans to solve about the White House: the worse information will pass by another.
Kelly said the staff should flow over paper or with brifing, because the other would make better decisions when it comes to good knowledge.
Kelly’s diagnosis is very meaningful, but others tried to harmonize Trump by controlling the media diet and failed.
President Trump’s relationship with television is going to ten years ago and she is now in the White House, TV monitoring funnel is still in good condition.
A former campaign consultant Sam Nunberg said to Politico in February, "Aday Trump, if he was sad, as he did not take a fair place in the media organizations, he was increasing yielding to show him that he was fair in convinient media organizations."
Tara Palmeri from Politico was once "According to the campaign officer, Trump's key to keeping his Twitter habit under control was to ensure that personal media consumption has a stable flow of praise." He wrote.
OK.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit is "under control" at any time.
Maybe these campaigners know something we don’t know what we’re left, for example, Trump’s tweets will be much more provocative if they don’t interfere with them.
We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump does not send.
If the elements were able to remove it from danger even several times, then their efforts were valuable.
But no one couldn’t stop Trump’s continuous discussion.
A part of the problem was that White Saray competes with each other, that is, in any case, trying to advance their agents with materials they offered to Trump (they could be reliable or unreliable) and people who stand out of their own world views.
In Politico may, during all this story, the consultants had reported the strategically interrogation of information.
A sample, which tells about the details of the Muhabir Shane Goldmacher:
"The current and former Trump officers say that Trump reacts negatively from the press, especially to leaks that have poor effect, and is self-covered to find where they are sourced.
Another of someone at the end of February, the internet provocation Charles C. Johnson’s site was also that Katie Walsh, from GotNews.com, a special pen helper Katie Walsh, accused a printed copy of an article, which accused Katie Walsh, "the source behind a number of leaks in the White House."
Johnson’s fundamentally because of harassment from Twitter or no tangible evidence, or in the past, it’s an important thing that he had led crimes and returned from them.
Trump reads the article and started asking questions about Walsh to the staff.  "
Goldmacher added that the usual private pen Reince Priebus and the White Saray staff secretary Rob Porter "Trump's paperwork and documenting system."
How did this result?
Kelly is trying to do the same thing after three months.
Maybe Priebus will appear as a more effective manager, but Trump still competes in its own impulse and helps to still penetrate.
These unchangeable factors will make Kelly’s task quite difficult.

Allamiral Yaycı was previously judged with insult crime.
It turned out that there are still FETÖ’s and alleged crime.
The former Air Pilot Kurmay Albay Hakan Dinç, who was insulted by Yaycı, only in the form of information note, the former Adana Fig. 10.

Michelle Carter was sentenced to punishment due to messages that encourage Conrad Roy to suicide
A woman with Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years, as she was dare to suicide his boyfriend through messages and phone conversations.
Michelle Carter, who is currently under 20 years old, will attract 15 months of the fine to evacuate behind the fingers and five years.
In June, Carter ruled his own life in July 13, 2014 from the crime of murder of Conrad Roy with a taxi.
Mr. Roy's father spoke in the trial of Thursday: "The heart of the uterus is broken.
My son was my best friend.  "
Carter's retainer path is allowed to stay free, open.
Although the maximum faced with a penalty of 20 years, he argued that both his and Mr Roy suffers from mental illness.
Carter, wearing a blouse of red pants and cream color, with elder eyes when it hits the punishment, his hands were kenetized and eyes looked at the ground.
The defender said the court, "The actions of him killed the Conrad Roy."
He ended his life to improve his own.
He said.
"He did not show that he had regretted.  "
But Carter’s lawyer said, "It was a terrible situation where he regrets all."
What there is, the Truth Lawrence Moniz said that his "great, maturity level, or even any important effect on the actions of mental disease."
A prosecutor Mr Roy's mother reads a description of Lynn Roy: "No days I'm going to keep yas for my dear son's loss.
I want to be proud with me and how I overcome everything. I am trying to be next to her sisters with all my pain that we will carry forever.
Mr. Roy's sister Camdyn Roy gave his brother's testimony that his brother could never attend his wedding, or the reality that he could not be at all.
"It is always a pain that you will always be with me when I haven’t been there for those people who have been together every day."
As there is no Massachusetts law that says to tell a person to suicide, the case looks like to create insight.
Mr Roy was 18 years old when it was deadly from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national interest in revealing that Carter’s short messages promote its own life termination.
When he was on holiday with his family, the girl said in many posts he sent two weeks ago from his death: "Because of himself, jump from a building, with a knife, there is a lot of ways you do not know.  "
In the previous moments from his suicide, he wrote: "You must do it, Conrad" and "You will open the generator you need to do and be free and happy.  "
Judgment Moniz said that by giving the instruction not allowed to take out of this case through the press, Carter wanted to attract interest through the death of Mr Roy.
The case divides legal opinions.
There were Amanda Knox, who had been guilty of murdering the British room friend in Italy before two years ago.
The lady Knox (30) released an article that says: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and assistance, not the pill.  "
Remarkable growth forecast from Mehmet Şimşek
Şimşek stated that in its description, in Turkey, inflation should be believed to low single digit figures, and he expressed that food inflation creates "risk area".
Deputy Prime Minister predicts that inflation will fall under 7 percent in 2018.
In the speech of lightning, he said:
Critical for the next 12 months in the reduction of certainlessness.
The biggest incentive is the reduction of uncertainties.
There is a strong government.
No ambiguity.
The ambiguities in our nearby geography are also reduced.
I believe by increasing our resistance to shocks with some reform, we sit on a growth trend over 5 percent of Turkey.
I told me before months.
The worst left behind.
Gradually, no longer our energy to reforms that will bring our energy to inclusive growth, employment increase...
That’s why the next 12 months are critical.
The reform from one side is reduced by ambiguities from one side, there is no political ambiguity already.
Our chance of construction is reduced in our close geography.
If we don’t want to say, we have a very classic market crashed.
Like Libya, Iraq.
We’re not just losing the market over 3.5 million.
When we look at the last 15 years, Turkey grew 5,7 percent, despite all these shocks.
Turkey, i.e., we have solid problems.
Now, by increasing our resistance to shocks with some reforms, we sit on the growth policy over 5 percent of Turkey by eliminating the question marks on the head of investors.
I'm open here, I have so generous retirement system.
I think that our pension companies do not have enough effort.
Once the auto attendance performance will be strong.
Why?
Because we received the measure.
Companies are not required to go and make costs.
We’ve made bushes in the form of how we’re allocated global assets, taking into account how performance is weak, by considering these concerns.
High returns you know in deposits.
Once clear, there will be a performance in addition to 25 percent of the state.
The rest of the extra is also the risk of treasure paper, there are also low.
When we look at the big picture, I think the interest will increase in the coming period.
Because they will see performance.
There is no failure in the other field, success.
We reinstalled BES in 2013.
There are 6,8 million participants, there is an accumulation of 70 billion pounds.
Give the right system has been successful.
There are 2,6 million participants in automatic participation, 775 million pounds have the accumulation.
We want more effort from companies.
They’re doing a little ad, you’ll tell this system.
We work in the period of withdrawal.
Maybe if we're a little stretching...
We are looking for.
Maybe citizens see return and stay in the system.
38 percent of the system.
nearly half of the separates are the individual retirement.
You don’t want two individual pension accounts.
What do you do?
You are coming out of the airport.
We were waiting for a withdrawal around 10 percent of the right.
There’s a lot of optimism.
Once the system works.
We have put a ceiling at prime.
Insurance companies explain only sided sometimes.
They have increased their premiums very quickly.
When we ask what happens, judgment decisions are not taking into account existing regulations.
We have made new clear editing.
We said to do you.
They said, we’ll expect judgment.
We said that this would not be.
We have the privilege here.
Of course, some companies have been imitated when moving to this ceiling premium application.
We have made a new arrangement.
We created a pool of risky fuses.
I’m saying, I’m going to say again.
I prefer this system to work through competition.
So I don’t find these ceiling price apps right, they were forced to us.
I would like that three-dimensional look at this event.
Take into account the system we do.
Two, the system is normal, it is a price in the patikada.
In addition to him, the burdens are heavy, paid every 100 pounds of premium are almost 30-31 pounds of tax SGK.
I am also working at this time, we will talk to our finance minister.
Thirdly, technology is developing rapidly.
Now over time, traffic accidents are also structurally reduced.
But this is mandatory traffic insurance.
SABAH saved his cuff to leg
Buerger disease, which appeared from the age of puberty, was a discomfort that was seen in ancient men, but now in women, it began to be seen frequently.
One of these women is 36 years old Mehtap Dursun.
Two years ago, the pains begin to be chroniced in the foot base.
The young woman who was forced to walk, faced with the risk of losing the leg.
A friend suggested Prof. Dr. Yusuf Kolo.
SABAH’s cuffs showed the news of ‘Azerbaycan Extraordinary Haller Minister’.
It turned out that Dursun fighting Buerger disease that goes to Kolo.
Prof. Home Kolo took the young woman to emergency surgery.
Stop getting rid of pain after a short time, now it sees oxygen treatment.
Audi 850.000 Diesel Tool will be Modified when Auto Manufacturers Meet Reverse Response
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it will offer software upgrade on more than 300,000 vehicles.
The head of the BMW board said that BMW’s headquarters (which is thought of baning or limiting of diesel vehicles) including Munich, the company believes that “it is more smart options than the cross limitations of the company”.
On the Daimler Tuesday, three million Mercedes cars in Europe said they would be modified to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies did not identify these moves back.
European car manufacturers intensively encouraged the use of diesel vehicles to help meet carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States.
But nitrogen oxides that diesel engines are revealed are considered cancer maker and can cause asthma.
The cost of equipment that needs to be worn to neutralize the filthy smoke, where diesel vehicles are removed, and the price of cars is difficult to remain competitive.
While German car manufacturers are facing reviews, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government was also accused of pampering strong car firms and overlooking the problems.
Companies are trying to adjust the devices known as a misleading device and avoid repeating the errors of the Volkswagen from loosening it in normal driving conditions to adjust emissions to regulations when a car is tested.
Many Volkswagen managers were accused in the U.S. and others are under investigation at both sides of the Atlantik.
Last month in the engine development section of Audi, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
Former director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is a Italian and therefore does not protect against criminal returns and can be judged in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi draged to a German criminal investigation, including Volkswagen; the authorities had expanded the United States-based investigation after accumulating Audi with a system to get rid of emissions rules in Europe.
Audi’s investigation can be included in Volkswagen: Luxury car manufacturer has an extreme share in Volkswagen’s profits.
Jumping fishing every time you see
Prof. Dr. Yusuf Şükrü Çağlar, President of the Turkish Neurosurji Association, warned that fishing from 2 meters to shallow places, not sure its depth.
Thousands of thousands of people face the risk of paralysis due to neck fracture and spinal damage due to their shallow waters.
Neck fractures often develop in 5 or 6" spine.
The feature of fractures affects the nerves that also feed respiratory muscles as well as arm and leg muscles.
Prof. Home "This type is the most valuable organ in accidents, the neck bölgesi region, which is broken, is cut or compressed by the spine shredded due to broken.  "
"The first aid in spinal cord injury is that it can lead to death, not only to increase damage in accidents."
The water-fishing branch is ranked fourth in spinal injuries.
The average age of injured 20-29 and the majority of men.
Prof. Home Ages should not be thrown into fish in the water, which can not be seen in the interior.  "
"How good you can have a heavy injury."
Prof. Home Ages also reminded:
Depending on the level of hasarı in the place where the damage caused by injury while fishing can occur in various degrees of arms and legs.
You can know the swimming but it can be water purifier.
It can fit the place that looks deep to you.
Due to the warning boards placed on sea coasts in the US and Australia, the fishing in shallow water was reduced by 70 percent in skip cases.
Prof. Home Despite the fact that the ages are located on the sea coast of 28 provinces in Turkey, unfortunately there is no one warning sign in places outside Istanbul.  "
"The health director of each province before every summer, in relation to such accidents from the decision of life, schools and social awareness project, it is necessary to consider information light or information boards in the beaches and pools."
President Prof. Dr. Kadir Kotil, President of the Spinal and Peripheral Neural Surgery Group of the Turkic Neurosurgery Association, suggested that in the case of injury:
112 peers as the first job at the moment.
The neck should be kept as fixed as possible, not moving, detected with a hard collar.
The airway should be supplied and the patient should be placed in the reverse side for drainage of the water that escapes to the lung.
It should not be shaken for water discharge from legs.
The patient should not try to correct shape disorder in the neck.
Neck vertebra can be broken.
However, if hasar has not yet been damaged, the first aid and an inappropriate position to be given to the neck during the transportation of the patient can cause the broken bone parts to print and cut damage.
Provence Lavender under the threat of climate change
It turned into a symbol of Provence in South France, but there is a warning that it is under the threat of climate change.
Lavender has a decline due to conditions such as drought and disease-bearing insects, and this situation causes scientists and farmers a huge headache.
Eric Chaiss, a specialist in Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "In the danger of lavender effect in provence, because in recent years, the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change, which brings rain in spring much less and mostly in autumn.
This affects the life of lavender.
There is also a small cryustos bug, which is a detrimental of a leaf that transfers micro bacteria, and it is very much from them in very dry weather.  "
And many things are in danger.
For perfumes and cosmetics as well as the holidaymakers take, lavender oil drops into a glorious advance.
Eric Chaiss said: "We have little, less advanced or no weak, while they need to cope with a lot of large flowers.
So we have less essential oil parts.  "
It contains better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but there is also to spray a protective ballet and water mixture to plants and improve more durable types of dry conditions.
Journalist murder draws gold of the growing threat in Mexico
Weekly newspaper Riodoce’s staff is often met Wednesdays to review the plans to take place in the newspaper of organized crime in Sinaloa province.
But on this day, they met to talk about their safety in the shade of their tragedies.
It was said that they are important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists see what feels safer: do they bring their children to their own or leave them at home if it is the goal of a hand bomb in 2009.
Security experts write three words on the blackboard in front of the room: fastness, neutrals, allies.
They want to suggest names for each column; they do not need any evidence, perceptions and internal sounds sufficient.
The journalists who suspect the drug leaks, politicians, business people, government or cardels to bond to the salary, are a list full of bad man that makes Mexico write his chaos in the newspaper.
There is no stakedos in violence, while the number of corpses in the country increases, more of them are journalists: According to the Journalists Protection Committee, at least 25 people since the President Enrique Pena Nieto took over the task in December 2012. After the attack and threats, 589 died under the federal protection, and this year at least seven in seven states until the main year.
Among the last payers, there are directors and inspirational sources of Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
Valdez, "The biggest mistake to live in Mexico and become a journalist." He writes narcotic violence on one of the many books.
His absence is deeply felt, but its presence is everywhere, in the front of the building of Riodoce with the word "Adalet", a large photo showing the middle finger of Valdez. Two correspondents in 30, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wear the t-shirts showing his smile, the glasses face and the Panama hat, which is the acronym.
Workshop takes place two months from his death; correspondents speak common traumas, nightmares, insomnia, paranoyas.
Despite the fact that a private federal prosecution was created in order to address journalist cases in 2010, only two of them were prosecuted according to Journalists Protection Committee.
Every year thousands of murders connected to drug leakage and organized crime are rarely removed from the law.
In Riodoce, despite the fact that the hearts are broken, although the ground is no longer exaggerating, they insist on violence in Sinaloa.
Without information about Katillery, without justice, discussing security is very few, says Ibarra.
"This workshop is very aptalca."
As long as we don’t know, you don’t trust anyone.  "
15 May morning Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital Culiacan.
The Red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two guys only a few blocks of time; forced from the tool and hit 12 times, for the name of the newspaper translated as predicted Onikinci River.
The gunman walked away from his car and hit the vehicle nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
Wife and two adult children remained.
In Culiacan, the coders tend to circulate freely.
But there is nothing more than just silence on Valdez.
Last year it was one of the most blood battle areas of Sinaloa country when fighting to fill out the gap of rival groups after the return to the US in the arrest and in the stove.
Empty one day on the street in Sinaloa or many people to be shot and killed or filled with larger mozoles than many houses to live, two floors, decorated with the kings of the drug of cemetery.
For a minute, just forget the "skill" status that controls the only cardelin valuable ports and drug trading routes to the US.
Despite this, and although Valdez is deeply aware of the dangers of his business, Riodoce’s co-founder and director Ismail Bojorquez (60) has been stacked from guilt as it fails to protect his friend.
He believes that two bugs contribute to murder.
The first had an interview with Damaso Lopez, one of the competing cardel groups in battle with the sons of Guzman in a publication in February.
This article may have been angry with the sons; possible members of the gang have purchased every nusha of the print distributed to newspaper dealers.
The second error was to force the Valdez to leave the country for their safety, after being handed to another newspaper where the same story is located.
Valdez was a legend outside Mexico and abroad and was seen as a milestone in Mexican origin violence against journalists who were killed.
I had survived for a long time, my friends and colleagues have always had gone there.
Five colleagues were an experienced correspondent in Noroeste in 2013 when they joined Riodoce by selling 50 $ shares in the emergence of Riodoce.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to make journalism without mentioning the subject of archotic," said Bojorquez.
Timely, the newspaper won with bold and honest news and increased ads with sales.
Those would love to publish life-consuming research without fear of censorship, and their readers have never covered themselves in a publication they could read stories that nobody could dare to news.
Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for newsing in Latin America after eight years from its establishment.
The same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Journalists Protection Committee, as the tip of the Mexican drug story shows the courage to leave in advance if it is based on.
He agreed that he was afraid of openness.
During the CPJ awards, "I want to continue to say."
In an interview with Rompeviento TV, the drug was "a lifestyle" in Sinaloa.
"You must accept the task that falls to you as a journalist. Or you play this or apta.
Me, ‘How much death I did... I don’t say what’s going on?  "
Riodoce staff miss Valdez; like hamal, he knows how to survive his friends, who are generous in the swearings, embraces and mills...
They trusted her routine.
Always wearing the hat.
El Guayabo in the face of the office went to the bar and always sits on the same table.
Now they are asking: Have the love for her routines collapse?
His death forced them to question their assumptions, how they will work best and survive.
"If you're dealing with their women, their children, with clean work, with hidden aircraft runways that they use to get rid of the drug, it doesn't go to those like.  "
Bojorquez said, "This thing was to overcome the limit."
The result was a high-grade autosecond and self-protection even at the best time.
Trust your own instincts.
If bad scents are coming, stop away.
Andres Villarreal, the director of Riodoce articles, "a sense that can be taken in mind... and Javier was something that came up.
He and others say that the old rules in Sinaloa are not valid; the same Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that have a poisonous mixture, are not valid in the weak institutions and other states that host corrupted government...
Floor changing continuously.
Riodoce staff is not allowed to multiple mobile phones in the room where they meet for security training; days ago, only the spy software sold to governments appeared to spy on journalists and activists in Mexico.
Two police officers outside wanted to get rid of a tree shade from 104 degrees (40 Celsius).
Riodoce was allocated by the state government to protect the office in a four-story building in the middle-class district of Culiacan.
Some of the semi-skillers were wondering whether these officers were from the polices in 50 percent, which he said that the preacher of this officers was not reliable in person.
Those were months to go to the rural part of the mountainy, where the drug gangs are controlled as a verb.
In the issue of this week, Riodoce conquers three main stories.
The former large boxer Julio Cesar Chavez had murder in Sinaloa.
In addition, the valinin metmleketine had the disclosure of intensive government spending.
A block from the prosecution was the most expensive restaurant of Culiacan.
There was no official explanation of who was missing or how it was, so when it was time to write everyone knows in the city, he dominated the secret: the restaurant was observed both drugs leakers and authorities.
A correspondent learned that from official records, almost all the last century politics of the restaurant are registered under the name of the Corporate Revolution Party (PRI) in the management dominated by each stage.
Recently, many PRI guardians are accused of corruption in sensational events.
Villareal asked him to write the correspondent about the events that took place earlier, including the escape in a soldier print, one of the sons of "El Chapo" Guzman in that event.
Only months ago readers were looking at the corner of Valdez for the best source of information about missing.
Due to its thin structure, "El Flaco" is covered by Villareal (46), "We already know what is happening."
All our communication channels with our resources at the moment were cut.  "
The staff is reused as a warehouse for pankart and stickers that protest journalist murders at Valdez’s office while they turn into activists on behalf of the press.
Muhabir Miriam Ramirez appeared in the next morning show for a few pankart captains and another journalist in the office of the local prosecutor.
Salvador Mane was destroyed three days after the murder of Valdez in the province of Michoacan in the west.
A burned corpse found and official servants according to DNA tests say that it is.
journalists around the country have expressed their thoughts loudly by typing "help to press" in organized protests.
Today, the director Bojorquez tries to provide international support for justice in the case of Valdez, far from Washington.
Ramirez in a meeting with Sinaloa governor in the next day where Valdez was killed, accused authorities to spy on journalists and kill them as they say correctly.
After that day, he wanted to take the government news to another task, thinking that hisnger has poisoned its impartiality.
Valdez said that the journalists in Mexico are organized by crime, crime partner official servants and "heavy" by an unfortable society.
In his last book named "Narko-gazetecilik", journalists wrote that not only by drugs gangs, but they were killed by the order of security forces in cooperation with politicians and organized crime.
The media observer group of Articulo 19, last year connected to the police and official officers to the half of the attacks made to journalists.
Ramirez said, "You want to water you because you die in Mexico."
Cinayetler clearly made the cold shower effect.
Nobody forgets the death of Maria Elizabeth Macias in the north border state Tamaulipas for six years ago.
Cesedi was found in conjunction with a note that it was signed by Zetas cardeli: "I am here because of my leaves.  "
A computer keyboard and headphone are serialed next to the copared head.
In North border province Chihuahuahua, the correspondent Miroslava chose to close some posts like El Norte after Breach was killed in March.
After their directors were killed in 2004, the others continue as the El Manana from Nuevo Laredo.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez was voiced on the front page with the headline titled "What do you want?"
Some journalists escape from their own states, even from the country.
This is a burkan decision.
They are hard to find work on the day and still lick the streets by waiting for danger.
Sometimes, after three months of escape from Veracruz, they are treated as a photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was folded in an apartment in Mexico City with four women in 2015.
For those who continue to work back the mold, this is a dance made every day with high risk decisions.
Ibarra, who wants to become a poet at once, says that it frightens itself to news about drug trade.
"Mexico is going to hell and I'm therefore correspondent." He said.
A late night in the past, half of the last number is prepared for finishing preparations, while Riodoce began to sit on the sidewalk outside of the directors of writing works and drink beer, at the same time the phones began to play.
A number of armed conflicts including rival gangs and security forces near Mazatlan, a holiday place on the beach caused 19 verified death.
As promised in a number of cardel messages in the environment, the battle continued to conflict.
The news through mobile phones on the leverage puts Riodoce on the website.
The front page would stay in case of changing the next day.
Sirens began to retouch nearby, there is a conflict with another weapon in the environment.
Bojorquez quickly eyesed to see if they are triggering police officers who hold seizures.
They didn’t even show if they are afraid.
Under the huge portrait of the new founders of the newspapers, his middle finger was exhibited to see all Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his footprint.
"How can you think about the contraction," said Bojorquez, "On the day where Javier was killed, the trainer wants me to send him out to the street news?"
used camouflage to avoid dinosaur enemies.
It looks like a statue at first glance, but it is a terrible one.
The researchers now announced that the first findings of an incredible creation of the sizes of gergedan are very well protected by a Canadian miner, the experts described this as the ‘the Mona Lisa’ of the ‘therosors.
He was so well preserved, they can understand that the flake skin is redish brown, and they could say that it is a 'sorun history'.
The report on the current Biology magazine described this as the best preserved armored dinosaur and one of the best dinosaur breeds in the world.
Fosil lived 110 million up to 112 million years ago from the middle of Kretase Period, a new type of nodozor.
The extraordinary well-groomed situation turned her to surprise the researchers that define it as ‘really spectacular’.
The plant is a armored, the best preserved fossil based on reports in National Geographic.
Shawn Funk was found by 21 March 2011 when accident Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta Canada.
He shot on something strange to rock in the environment and decided to look closer.
It was sent to the central fosil Royal Tyrrell Paleonology Museum.
Next 6 years 2500 pounds (1100 kg) have revealed the wild animal from the ground stack.
The result completed after such an intensive study is now ready to be revealed.
The head writer Caleb Brown, a scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, which was exhibited by the wound, you can even believe that if you shorten your eyes a little, almost sleep.
 ' As one of the most beautiful history of science and the best preserved type of dinosaurs, the dinosaurs will go as Mona Lisa.’
The researchers found that the skin was coated with the armor, and benzese to an escalating tank, probably faced with a serious threat from meat-dered dinosaurs.
It used red and white camouflage to hide from dinosaur predators, which is quite heavy armored, and known as contra-gölgeing, used a protective technique that many of today’s animals also used.
Experts say that they stand out by larger dinosaurs, allowing them to mix better and skip their enemies.
The creature from the 110 million-year-old nodozor family appeared on May for the first time and is currently exhibited at the Royal Tyrrell Paleonology Museum.
The researchers finished their work now and gave the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of the teams who spend more than 7000 hours of troublesome time to reveal it.
The type of exceptional preserved Dr. Mitchell and international scientists were able to document the shape of the team with the pattern of the flakes and the armor on the body.
They discovered contra shading, which is a common method of defence in animals latitude and means that the upper part of the wound is darker by the bottom.
Although contra shading is common, the findings are surprised because the size of the Borealopelta is a lot of contra shading animals that are alive today.
This means that the dinosaur is sufficiently pressured by meat-soft dinosaurs, and the evolution is also eaten to face hiding as a method of survival.
But the most contemporary animals that use contra shading (mesela geyikler, zebras or peadillos) are much smaller and much more explain to being a hunting; it means that this nodozor faces a serious challenge to survive.
Brown said, ‘Devasa, how dangerous dinosaur predators in the strong hunting Kretase, applied to a heavy armored animal’.
The chemical analysis of organic compositions in the flakes revealed that the skin of the dinosaur is red brown.
To find out what scientists eat in the last meal, they continue to examine the animal for tips on life, including preserved intestinal contents.
When the dinosaur died, they believe that it falls on a river and drags to the sea, there is a ridge-top ocean surface.
Alberta during that period was as hot as South Florida was today, and possibly the rivers and oceans have spread to much more in.
Brown, "Nodozor, completely covered and preserved with sequin skin, but it is really worth considering that the original shape of the animal is also preserved in 3D."
 ' The result is that if the animal looks like early in Kretase today it seems almost the same.
You don’t need more imaginations to rebuild it; if you’re a bit short of your eyes, you can even believe it’s almost sleeping.’
Kretase was the time when the giant teropoids with obur dinosaurs standing on the two foot.
Although the king of all, Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years from the armored dinosaur Borealopelta, which can be hunted by a team of heybetli islands.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a monster weighing 6 tons in length of 38 ft (11,5m).
The latest findings believe that scientists in the Journal of Current Biology have dragged the sea after the death of Borealopelta and mummy in mud.
Created, by Shawn Funkk, in March 21, 2011, he had crashed Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta Canada.
The best preserved armored dinosaur including leather and armor according to the museum is complete from this and nose to hip.
18 ft average. (bear meters) in a weight up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
There are 2 20 inch long horns from the shoulders.
The researchers believe that this armored grass is now going to be a bulky lady in the place of Western Canada until the open sea drag by a river stoneed.
But the tomb under the sea of the dinosaur maintained the armor with excellent detail.
The fossilized remains of this special type are so well preserved, the skin parts are still covered the layers of altar armor all over the skull of the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko writes for National Geographic, this degree of preservation is uncommon to win "piyangoyu.
I look at him how incredible it is.
Fossilized leather parts are still covered with allsex armor layers, which are located in the head of the dinosaur.
It extends to the right front leg, up to 5 fingers.
I can count the flakes on the foot base.  "
Don’t be from your teeth while I’m white
Bem white teeth and an aesthetic smile dream of every person.
When people refer to such ways to whiten their teeth, the Head of Oral Laser Practices Association Nükhet Berk warns that they should stop away from products sold on the market or on the internet.
Nükhet Berk, which states that such substances that are sold are painted in the enamel surface, not a further recycling, can be provided with fine porcelain surfaces, which stick to the whitening of the teeth, with chemicals applied by dentists, or on the surface of the teeth.
Berk, who inhibits the formation of many diseases of the protection of dental health, attaches importance in terms of mental health with the opportunity of aesthetic applications and gum health and a beautiful smile, shares the following information:
As long as there is no disorder or genetic factors in dental structures, the teeth of young people are usually white.
Aging takes darker color over the years due to the frequent consumption of tooth enamels and cigarette, abrasive or dark-colored drinks.
The whitening of teeth can be achieved with fine porcelain surfaces, which is applied by dentists with chemicals applied by or without being vaccinated in the surface of the teeth.

"short" event in the Turkish army
My dear readers were made very interesting decisions in terms of the Marine Forces especially at the High Military Syrup (YAŞ) meeting which was made in the previous day.
This is not a oramiral to the commander of the Force, coramiral was brought.
It is an unprecedented application in our army.
What happened?
The Force Commander Oramiral Bülent Bostanoğlu filled its time, he had already retired...
And it was.
Now the order of commander came to Veysel Kösele, one oramiral.
Veysel Pasha, who was the victim of sandpas in the past and kept for a while, had to be commanded in the normal senior ranking.
But the government did not want him.
I am trying to tell you very much, if we start from the top at the Marine Force, 1, 3, 4 and 5 commands were not sweated.
In this case a single oramiral was up in the Marine Force.
It was necessary to bring him to the divorced authority: the Navy Commander in two numbers Oramiral Veysele.
What happened after?
Koramiral Adnan Özbal, located in the sixth place, was appointed by the government.
See the table now!
Oramiral Veysel Kösele stands there, but instead it is assigned a commander with lower ranks!
A senior asks for the order of your senior.
What will happen after that?
A oramiral, which is superior to Rütbece, does not serve at the order of a corgeneralin, which is without a senior.
It does not receive orders from it.
In this case, Veysel Kösele will not be folded into this pearl, if it was not shipped to retirement, today or tomorrow will be stacked.
This is also the pearl message given by the government to him: "Güle rose Veysel Pasha!"
Yesterday I had spread the news that I had to stack this article in the afternoon, but the situation was not yet officially explained.
Now let’s look back to those!
Government Veysel Kösele, or therefore, did not want, forced to stack, and instead of the commander, a coramirali return on the 6th place, and the understanding of the traditional "Crime" of our army.
In the work there is absolutely politics, we don’t even know the back of the curtain.
Maybe we’ll learn to tell someone soon!
Dear readers, I tried to tell the above very briefly, especially the senior event in the Turkish army is very important.
Not just as rank.
For example, Harp School finished in 10th place, the officer should be more senior than the 11th place finishes.
The first ordinary promotion to the general should be more senior than the second place.
We have experienced concrete examples of this senior event at Istiklal Harbin.
Garp Facade Command Ismet Pasha...
There are two hordes in the Emrin.
Army and 2. Army.
We have arrived in 1922, our hordes carry out the great taste and bucket the Greek army.
At this stage there are valuable names that are expected to be assigned to the military commander.
Refet (Bele) Pasha.
The self-arming commander is offered but says "I can't enter the command," he says.
Another name Yakup Şevki (Subaşı) Pasha.
Professor of Atatürk’s Harp Academy...
It is a valuable and senior commander that has been included in various battles, appealing to "Hocam".
In 1919, the soldiers and civilian Turkish light are caught together with the island of Malta by British.
In the return of the Yurda, he also says unwilled and the same things about the commander of the army: "The front of the body is unregarded, I am not throwing orders from it."
However, Atatürk convinces him to the minnet and Yakup Şevki Pasha accepts the commander of one of our two armys.
A very colorful name...
Ali Ihsan (Sabis) Pasha.
Very speaking, a soldier who constantly criticizes.
Iraq, Kafkas, Iran and a fight against various facades.
He is also exileed to Malta by British, escaped from there and comes to Ankara through Kusadasi.
The same thing Ali Ihsan Pasha also says when it is offered to his own army commander: "I can't fight at the order of Ismet, which is without senior ...
But being convinced...
But the bride looks, after the task started, the Garp Facade command entered the order is constantly discussing with İsmet Pasha, the incident goes out, and the horrible...
And a short time before the big taarruz is taken from the task and retired, instead the beard Nurettin Pasha is brought.
Then Ali İhsan never straightened from Atatürk.
The senior problem in the Turkish army is not only in battle, but also in peace.
Of course you need to exit.
Veysel Kösele is the last example.
How to learn the answer of the question "Who is the people?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply wrapped.
After a day of arrival to visit New York City, St. Louis sat in the bed of Airbnb, where she rented the native, and began to browse on Facebook on the phone.
One of the high school came to share.
"Polis killed a child under 18 years ago and he still lies on the street." He said.
I was surprised when someone else did not share this information in the content stream, it turned off Facebook and opened Twitter.
News A user called TheePharoah was constantly tweeted in his content stream.
St. Petersburg rap'er from the Louis region, Michael Brown had tweeted lively, 18 years old, a non-armed black was killed in Ferguson Missouri by a white police officer.
There are 4 hours on the street of Brown, which will stay in.
Ferrell himself, "This is wild." He thought.
But death was not something new for him or for society.
The phone then left the same evening to return to tweets about the collection of people in Canfield Drive.
The police had photos of a man who had written a pankart on "Ferguson police a little ago killed my unarmed son."
A police officer followed a live broadcast that stands with a dog that caviars in front of a group of protests.
Another police in another video, according to what he said, he set up the trigger of the rifle and shouted: "I will kill your wrist... animals.  "
Ferrell " I remembered that this was not used.
" This is not a murder that we can say from the species we are accustomed to and typical.
I felt urperti at that time.
I was angry and crying.  "
I booked a return ticket and went home to the next day.
After in 11 at night, 6 years old daughter took his father from his house and decided to go to Ferguson with her next morning.
Ferrell and Ferguson will come to the cinemas in the next three years, on August 11, a new documentary called "Whoin?".
This is a story that tells people’s perspective that survive and protest, love and loss, power and resistance live in that society and fill the streets with answers.
While Ferrell is wearing a flowered dress and driving his tool to Ferguson with a girl wearing a suitable crown to her, he returned to the conversation "the experiences of the blacks and about the conditions of the black."
"Do you remember that I taught black people to fight because they believe?"
"We are going to Ferguson at the moment because the police killed a child under 18 and this was not true.
I couldn’t get it. Ferrell said later.
"Today they are here... a result of those who are in the past.
Knowing this, seeing and growing in it.
Not only should be thoroughly developed in the field of activism and organizing, but also knowing the layers of the black experience and the condition of black and liberation should know what we should do for liberating ourselves.
I’m even lucky that I’m not going to experience her roughly racism personally, there’s no difference from any black woman-child.
I door him to his feelings that I will be doing evil by protecting him from them.  "
When they arrive at Ferguson, the first stops were in the South Florissant Road, which was in the face of the police center and metmur Darren Wilson then expected to talk about the topic, which turned into a nevi camp area for activists.
There, Ferrell and daughter set up connections with local business owners who prepared food packed.
They prepared bags and helped them to spread them to protesters.
For Ferrell, a slow new type of action was shaped.
While Missouri was a student at the State University, Minority Students became the head of the Nurses Association and determined that the black society concentrates on food justice and unjustice in health, "My teaching turned completely after 9 August."
"I haven't had a experience in doing so.
He came to himself.  "
After the week Ferrell met with Sabaah Folayan, one of the directors of the movie in a evening display.
Folayan said that he himself and his own image director Lucas Alvarado-Farrar said, "I wanted to hang" he said.
Ferrell's mind came a question: "Do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"
This skepticism was often reported by the person in numerous cases, including whites; to come to a society and to bring out its anger and resistance...
As Folayan explained in an interview that he gave closes: "We heard that the voices of eastern and growing people in Ferguson are intense, and we decided to do differently.  "
Folayan was already connected with the director Damon Davis, the region artist, known for the action of the prisoners who received death fine.
His participation was bitten Ferrell to the project, as well as the six other regions of the country, "Who is Whoin?" team followed this in the following years, without applying Brown.
David said: "This documentary is not talking to someone for us or speaking to us; we are talking about.  "
"I was the main thing for me, because this is how to represent my people.  "
Although Folayan did not focus on the experience of the "Equest Ferrell", he proved that the movement "is not about the leadership of the man, about the society to come together", he was the most vulnerability of film participants, spoke in the form.
As a result, "Who is the people?" surprisingly, like being in love and home with his wife, Ferrell documents the personal aspects of his life.
Ferrell, who rose the finished product to the first sight, said "Felted like."
"Fakat understood that when doing this job and people of black can have some sensitivity.  "
The story of Ferrell also strengthens the role of black gay women in Black Lives Matter movement and recenters.
In 2012, the #BlackLivesMatter motto is two of the three founders of the genre on social media two of them are gayly defined.
"Liderlikki black gay women are generally standing on the movement", said Ferrell, "and this is without being in battle in many facades continuously.
Black gay women have to carry all the weight of it.  "
Folayan joined it by specifying: "Hareket truly black women and many gay blacks standing by women.  "
Yet Ferrell insists that "when the one is not something in the variety of action that is happening," and his identity is therefore not chosen.
He says: "This was the person who moved energy.  "
"Fakat is not a encounter to be in its pre-purities, because black is a gay woman, it is very much that you will lose with a life in these intersections.
You can feel his energy from the screen.  "
In the way Ferguson, news cameras have gone from a lot, but the community takes alarming racial connections between police.
Ferrell under 2.5 years more surveillance due to close the motorway during a demonstration.
The socio-political atmosphere in the region where my house says is defined as "caring" with one word.
Nevertheless, Ferguson kept the song, which was scraped on the memory three years ago.
"We are our mission to fight for us.
Our mission is to win.
We must love and support each other.
Nothing else will lose from our chains.  "

A Similarity: The artist uses Chelsea Manning to create DNA portraits
In the middle of the room in the New York Fridman Gallery, there are many hundred, white, black and brown, almost clearly ambiguously similar to each other.
This 30 portrait artist was created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg, earbars sent by Chelsea Manning and cut hair.
As known, secret diplomatic messages were leaked with the WikiLeaks site channel after 35 years of punishment, the former intelligence analyst Manning sent his cut hair from the Fort Leavenworth prison.
The name of the new exhibition opened on August 2 is the Gospel.
This is a product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines discipline with the expertise of technology, computer science and art.
Dewey-Hagborg, which creates 30 portraits by analyzing DNA algoritmicly extracted from Manning and using what a person with this gene data can resemble. Dewey-Hagborg, which is only a way that DNA data can be processed (a determinism from the essence of comments) but also tightens its identity, perhaps reveals with a slightly cerebral comment.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but clearly describes himself as a woman in puberty, was sentenced to 20 crimes in 2013, from sixty Spying Law, computer counterfeiting and thief.
The image was printed by jail, so there was only one photo: görülür in the driver seat of Manning, which is apparently tedirgin, is a sandy, black white selfie, which is wearing a peruk of platin yellow.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg, the project in 2012, was successful with the huge amount of Stranger Önseziler.
The artist created portraits from the rashes of the judicial parts such as cigarettes and gum to remove a picture of what these people can look like.
He received an email from Paper Magazine at full time.
"Chelsea Manning did an interview when he was in prison, and he was a kind of portrait prompts that could accompany this article." Dewey-Hagborg announced that the new exhibition was in the press front.
It was unable to be visited at this time, the photo was not taken too, so they reached the Chelsea and asked that a DNA portrait had no interest.
Artist and his pilled inspiration became unexpected lettermates by making many letters change in two years of time.
Even Shoili Lawgo made the illustration, they have even revealed that another was dreamed of a cartoon book, which was dreamed of a future that was able to personally see his exhibition.
After a few days after Obama’s really appeared in the book, Manning wanted to evacuate, in Kansas a military prison was a decent nevi happy coincidence after seven brutal years.
While Donald Trump finds new, tweetable ways to fight against leaks and transexual soldiers and push the sharp divisions that he wants to repair himself, there is also a deep and strong thing about this exhibition that opens at the moment.
Dewey-Hagborg "Olays come from one reason when all of them are asked for strange timing."
An artist’s statement written on the wall of the gallery was called Manning’s signature in huge dimensions. The point of the letter "i" in his mind was put in the heart, "sexuality, race, sexuality and culture-based "automatic discrimination".
In the face of the wall there are many Cs, Gs and As written in pencil: the mitochondrial DNA secan...
Dewey Hagborg, including 200 letters (or sophisticated words of the artist), is asked to tell us how much we are surprised, at least biologically.
"What I expect people to remove from it is that our genome is so clear to whom we are and how much genetic data is clear to the interpretation, how much subjektif is. " said Dewey-Hagborg, the video work he did in 2007.
"DNA data can tell many different stories and this is 30 of these stories.  "
The last piece in the exhibition held in a single room is a page from the short comic that has been mentioned before.
Here Manning is shown when King Kong style comes out with a speaker from the United States Disciplin Winters.
"Do they have earned your mind."
"I never susma with it.  "
The artist from Philadelphia said "This came directly from a letter he wrote to me."
"When I talk about it, my hair is planted.  "
Manning did not yet personally see the exhibition (as it is quite predicted from the book of the book) but when he sees, masks with their genetic imitations collected as a group protester in the middle of the room will be greeted.
Like everything in the exhibition, genetic pill groups were sentenced to Manning's neck (5"2, Manning's length), which was especially done.
Dewey-Hagborg said, "I put them on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd."
"I wanted this, as well as the movement behind his liberation, a collective move shaped with Chelsea.  "

Start-ups to help your company isn’t the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the employee satisfaction in e-commerce start-up, but the surveys were not working.
The answers were usually uncertain, non-help or worsening.
Even some employees did not trust unless they commit anonymity.
Errett, who managed Madison Reed, an e-commerce company for 75 people on hair care in San Fransisko, says "No time amount or objectivity."
He also called one of the outside to help.
A new type of human resources start-up reveals how companies feel their employees.
The specific purpose is to produce a software to measure employees’ engagement, and to make sure that the firms are schipşak option surveys, targeting certain teams and demographic groups, providing employees with anonymous and complaint aid lines, and in some cases they allow senior managers to be announced by jealousy and direct board to employees that enable them to be announced.
Software analysis tools have tools that monitor your health such as Redwood City start-up, Glynt’s co-founder and head Jim Barnett, “Artık Strava and Fitbit, but your company spoke to Fitbit where?”
Errett says that employees using Glint understand what they think and feel better after three years.
In addition to offering schipşak surveys and option surveys to specific teams, the company offers a heat map where the parts are most complained and which director has low-liking points; so that the causes of them are tampered.
In order not to be the next Uber, companies begin to understand that businesses should be informed about their culture; Uber is in a scandal since they describe a harassment environment where they clearly say what they think in a blog post that a former employee is published.
This inspection request for start-ups like Glint means a very profitable business opportunity.
Financial technology insights website Let's Talk Payments according to global management, editing and compatibility industry can be worth $11.7 billion by 2020.
The interest and event in Denver Colorado-based start-up Convercent, which helps companies detect and block bad behavior, increased among the discussions of Uber at the beginning of this year.
Convercent’s Airbnb has 600 close customers including Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as customer.
Convercent, such as Glint, allows companies to make personalized "wood" destructions, collect real-time hidden responses and remove heat maps of problematic areas.
It also offers an anonymous message that employees can report bad behavior.
If the other is accused, the complaints are directly going to the board of the board.
The founder and head of Covercent Patrick Quinlan said, "Kamuoyu tribunal regulators"
Quinlan said: If a company acts badly to its employees or does not act ethically, the regulators may face the consumer neckcoats, employee zaiyatı or expense results even if they are not activated.
With more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, the restaurant chain Ruby Tuesday has been using Convercent for more than one year to be aware of the principles and procedures of its employees and to provide the way to reach the company center easily.
When he wanted to report a pre-worker problem, he had to find a phone number or email of the company center, he had a formal complaint and hopes to take seriously.
Ruby Tuesday’s head law nanaviri James Vitrano said that they are mostly intimidating and disturbing experiences, there is no good way to follow employee complaints.
But now, with the use of the company’s Convercent, previously hidden from managers sitting in office, city or state remotes (such as descriptive, harassment or unfair salary application) problems can be detected faster and resolved.
Vitrano, who manages the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday, spoke as follows: "I can approach this employment experience with a holistic, 360-degree perspective.  "
"We also protect our shareholders against business cases.  "
After the breach of ethical values caused by Arthur Andersen’s Enron scandal in 2002, companies deal with ethical, values, and employee relations issues more seriously in 2002, said Quinlan.
But after the "sosyal media comes from itself" the companies noticed that they will prevent dirty clothes from being viral.
"People were using the hope as a strategy before using technology to control the ethics."
They offer both Glint and Convercent software as a service and receive repetitive fees for the use of their products.
This is a business model and opportunity that both start-ups are approved by the risk capital investors that support.
Convercent; Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital have funded $10 million in February and brought its total capital to $47 million.
Glint provided $10 million dollars in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and took its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are not counted as many surprises when considering the natures, cultures and risk capitals connected to each other.
Increased research shows that today’s employees expect more than before their workplaces.
High salary and interesting projects in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are only minimal requirements.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, value and give their time to a positive mission.
Both Convercent and Glint’s global benefits and employee experience, Nina McQueen spoke as follows: "When people are happy to be in a company, they feel that their voices are heard, and if they are satisfied with the work they do, they are more internal to make that company succeed.  "
Investors gain when their portfolio companies work well; companies work well if their employees are inside and feel for the company.
If third party analysis tools are committed to increasing employees’ innerness and feeling of belonging, they are not surprising to find support.
Having data on employee engagement is important according to workplace culture experts.
However, the data will not work if the company does not move to the responsibilities.
In fact, if a company wants to feedback from employees, it is possible to create a expectation that the change is coming.
And if the expectation does not have enough speed, or does not happen at all, it can give frustration and feel the employees like broken.
Russell Raath, who is the head of consulting at Kotter International, said, "You will want 4000 suggestions, you need to be ready to speak 4000."
"For example, if you do not follow, employees will consider it, 'Is it really work?
About Us
And why do I get my care if you don’t care for you?’
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who made monthly employee surveys, was mobilized on the same day when a problem in Glint was reported.
And after collecting feedback from the employees who were satisfied with the speed of decision-making mechanism and communication quality, the company has reorganized various teams and added communication training to solve problems.
In Ruby Tuesday, the company receives new insights about its employees and hopes that in the long run, this would turn to hold more workers in such a industry known as a high number of employee input outputs.
Vitrona said: "If you are not connected to creating a transparency culture, you will lose people.  "
"And if you lose people, you will lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you will lose firms.  "
NCAA’s two workouts every day mean a long day for Bruins.
The clock comes to 11 at night and they are fitted to chat on a edge of the new training site on the campus of a cruh team consisting of UCLA football players.
Some stripped the tops of the jerseys, reveals the terden slipped backs of the first day in the training camp.
For an important part of the team, these empty minutes create a mid-day break.
After 3 hours of training, players registered in summer classes will return to their dormitories and will work for final exams before returning to Wasserman Football Center for meetings in 6.30 next morning.
Bruins coach Jim Mora said immediately before returning to Monday Tuesday: "Next three days is a crush for those guys.  "
Built to remove the load on players, NCAA lifts two workouts per day, at least until the finals were finished on Friday, it actually extended their days.
That’s why UCLA’s first three training was programmed to start at 7.15 in the evening to adapt players to the already frequent program.
A more day training for the lack of two trainings per day; Bruins is taking close forward to a week according to the season that the camp starts, and during the summer school, Mora’s first time during the six season in Westwood.
In September, Texas A&M plans to do 18 training until 20 August, starting official match preparations for openings.
Mora said that players have added new pens to the intensive study program, while NCAA supported the rule change.
Mora said: "We have a huge load for three or four days, and this is very difficult.  "
"And they have recently passed; they work, awesome children.
I think we will have more time when we arrive on Saturday, it will be really awesome.  "
UCLA will stop their training when camping; the luxury hotel Luskin Center, which is kept in the rain of the football ball on the parking and finish on the side, and close the back of the castle with a protective network, is not at all easy work when the sites are lying on the sight line.
The players with Bruins are planned to settle from the beginning of this week, but Mora accepts that during the season there may be a problem with the discharge of these rooms.
Mora said, "You will be our trust."
"It's not so much to think that a real concern and someone will rent a room and take a training to video there.
If you have a training video record, this is a good thing to the bay.
But there will be security and the above parking place will be our safety in 8.
We will do our best with us.
I'm not going to worry too much about it.
We have a plan.  "
Facebook increases story verification power to fight against fake news
Facebook will send more potential fake articles to third-party storypers and show their findings under the original sharing; the world’s largest online social network has told you how to struggle with the name as fake news on Thursday.
In a statement on the company website, it said that they will use updated machine learning to detect probable counterfeits and send them to stories validaters, and this will potentially show the story verification results under the original article.

Create comics: The story of a Castle in the UK
The ufacık Scotney Castle in the nearby history was featured in a Squeeze music clip and was a shelter in the 1970s and 1980s for Margaret Thatcher.
But at the moment; the skirt hair inspired a comic written by Jamie Rhodes, a passion for historical documents, Scotney witnessed a 700-year-old history from the comfort seat in the Bewl River valley in the City.
"I find it very nice to look at the handwriting of someone who is dead for 300 years." He says efkarli.
"How to keep this letter in my personal bond.  "
A Castle in England extending from Edward Patrol to Central Age, each story is documented families who have lived in Scotney to be photographed by a different artist (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg).
This is not the first book based on a archive of Rhodes: He also wrote the Teeth and Other Stories of the Dead Man in 2014, a project that inspired by stories in the British Library.
"My eyes were filled, even if the finger on the edge of a letter written in 1700s by a dual agent that works for narrow James fans."
"This was the trace of his thumb!
The letters are always odoured because then you have a fire for light.
For someone else in the future of 300 years, this smell feels as if it is orda.
Ah, I love archives!
As one in love with old paper, I went to get support from the National Trust and the UK Art Council, and I had a little bit of adhering to the requirement of warmness if it is necessary to stay almost four months in a castle. It seems much good at the time.
Rhodes has been working with many treasures and antiques, such as the "new" castle of Victorian period, scanned archives and mounted backdrop heads on the walls of the ficane and many centuries-old bottles.
With the guards, the gardeners and sometimes the book's illustrations with artists working on the illustrations, the lands and remains of the old castle.
Then at night, "we put into writing and writing"
National Trust is not known as a detailed date of Scotney because it can reach full access but the last inheritance Elizabeth Hussey in 2006.
When Rhodes came to ten years later, the staff had started to address the archive, which explains it: "The annual aristocrats of the century were as follows: 'Oh, throw him between the ceiling'.  "
Logs, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps that determine the limits of what they have: "You think that the prophecies will be boring." Rhodes said, "There was a birch tree that fights over two families.
divorce, guys!"
Some stories in the collection, including The laborer, who abandoned the new built-in castle to participate in peasant Isyani in 1381, are using the castle as a leap point to make a wider introduction to the British history.
"Kent and Sussex's Knight Familys named in this book, there is a record in the castle that he was asked at 1380." says Rhodes.
"I began in this wall and thought that one might have a good starting point.
Maybe these two may be linked?”
The Priest, who tells the story of Darrell family, who kept a Cizvit papaz for 7 years during the British Breeds, in a tight connection with the history of the castle.
Or a coffin filled with stones and the 18th century leaker, which is considered to countertop its own funeral, Arthut Darrell, The Smuggler (a disclosure made after the years when the stool is removed from the soil).
Darrells Rhodes’s favorite Scotney family: "These gentlemen seemed to be the owl layout, they are always going into boron and spent money for what they couldn’t afford.
Darrell men in different generations have solved debt crises with rich old women; I imagined them as a group of handsome guys who are sad to build women varicose veins.  "
Rhodes, who ends his mission in the castle, looking for other monoil writing experiences.
In the Finnish wild life, the field of a sanatorium at the beginning of the 20th century, he completed a two-week work for a comic about Elämänmäki, which has been re-governed by nature since then.
But Scotney holds a separate place in his chest.
"I'm sorry for I'm going." He says.
"Sanki: 'Oh, now I have to go and face the possible real life of the lanet.'  "
Response to Meral Akşener 'Maho'
The Secretary General of the Nationalist Motion Party İsmet Büyükataman made a written statement on the claims of the resignation of social media and press on recent days.
Büyükataman, using the expression "kin waste" to MHP, from the corners of the social media and "base old rifle Marksist" to MHP, "The driver was referring to the games and benches to inhibit the presence under the MHP roof after 12 September.
Büyükataman said:
"The history of the Turkish nation is unable to be prepared, how much record can not be withdrawn from Turkish" is corrupted, the crime file is fluffy, the idea is blurred, the mind is rubbed if there is mixed.  "
"Now they appeared "MHP Kocaeli Gölcük District Governorship management and members of 410 people and MHP Bursa in Yenişehir district 215 people were stacked.
The public is wrong with unfounded news such as 250 stacks, 300 stacks.
The newspaper is deepened to lie in the columns of the newspaper.
As there is no subject to a stack that reaches our hands, the number of tokens in the places where the bet is not exceeded one hand.
Büyükataman, located in the "sözde" ranking on the exceptions, said that the public was attempted to be misleaded and perceived management with "sözde" questionnaires.
Büyükataman said, "The propaganda and campaigns that are facing perception against MHP"
MHP Secretary General Büyükataman, who expressed MHP’s Turkish politics is an important and indispensable actor, said:
The power of the old Marksists is not enough to destroy the place where MHP gained in the conscience of the Turkish nation.
All comments performed are a dirty account behind the detection management methods applied.
Because politics and media planted the eye on the MHP base.
When we are located in our place, there is no sense in what we don’t work and strive for in favor of our part.
What are the gamma that they can’t be used in our party to their account?
In their lives, MHP also non-woven, did not share our memories, did not understand our liquors, did not participate in our struggle, even if it is joined, it should always be able to engage others in the minds strayed in the edge.
Milliyetçi Motion Party’s efforts to remove the unity and integrity of those who are unable to take fit, discussion and hizip removal are an effort to beyhude.
And it will surely go back and hit the owner.
Nationalismist Movement is the last castle, which is standing in the Turkish nation, despite severe destruction.
In his description, the "politan heartcarcers" said, "cyanists" for those who have suggested MHP to target, is not the "Nationalist movement."  "
"Okyanus beyond the root of the outside altitudes of the inside will not be able to reach the purposes regardless of the price."
The MHP’s Büyükataman, who uses the phrase "They will be ash in the relative fire," in the description of the opposition parties and terror organizations together, in the following claims: "From CHP to HDP; from there to Persians, who do from PKK to FETÖ" will not be able to perform the right operation of Turkish nation to have their own fate.  "
Today, MHP, without Turkish, we resist the new tactical and games of Turkish planers without MHP; the MHP-free government struggled until the end of the uncertainties who want the MHP Assembly.
Now we will spoil games, we will run players.
The Grandataman said "The patent of the driver is in MHP" used the phrases that impose Meral Akşener: "As in the Banker Bilo film, a former Greenmaking, I will take Maho peasants to Germany, and how it left in a mountain patch of Istanbul, after a visit in hundreds of trucks case, if the resigners of the person who went to the pursuit, took you to power and leave the edge of the cliff.  "
This is a matter of them, but our only request from these pros is that they are new.

Writers commented on Fenerbahçe-Sturm Graz match
Two seasons, I didn’t find, I’m not going to say, and I’m reconstructed in Kadıköy...
A "mangal yurekli" team in the absences of Aykut Kocaman was on the field to make the agreement "stop on our back" with the fans.
We can bring criticism to the game, positions or performances, but I did not watch a game that works and seeks for this for a long time.
The first match was revealed, but yesterday the apoles of their own hooked omzuna; Fenerbahçe’s command in the field is now Valbuena.
When transferring, the age had been problematic, but there was a sentence of "unknown character" in the words of Kocaman.
30 years ago we gave the name right of the atomic ants to Riza Çalımbay.
If you deal with, the French player will be the most visible comment.
In all parts of the field, all the rust organizations are joined and all the responsibility and a goal is to score a short neck show.
Alper’s leading play left the Sturm Graz team at the second strike.
Fenerbahçe called continuous formula to overcome such a hard wall while closing the circuit without corner attenuation.
They are dominated by the ball, but they can not produce effective rust in the field of any competing punishment.
This image can bring "santrfor required" comment but we are facing the game, which he hesitates to pass to Ahmethan, can not put into the position of the only santrforun in his hands.
Or the team should not be trusted to the young player or develop a bit more of its performance.
They couldn’t take advantage of two clear opportunities after score 1-1.
The tour was important, but it was even more beautiful on the night to lift up with the "gol" on this side that matches the fight of the players.
Probably 1-2 new transfers will come more than Monday.
But the truth is that Fenerbahçe’s biggest need is 12...
We are in the verge of a very bright and pleasant season with this style of play, which carries the heart of the tribunes who are trying to play in the front.
Aykut Kocaman’s machine builds its zember, needs some more time.
Physicians are good in quality.
Game quality will also develop.
You see that all of the footballers in the field have increased their self-confidence.
For a new page, there are a lot of needs to match the night.
The rise of sex robots is real and we have to worry about
When you think that you can’t be even more strange in 2017, a new report goes out about technological developments in the sex robot industry.
Yes.
Sex robots are currently a big event.
Recently, the Responsible Robot Science Authority (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to 10 years.
At Sheffield University, we must seriously take their rise according to Christmas Sharkey, a professor who retired from robotic science and artificial intelligence branch and founders of FRR.
Customers can choose the eye color, meme tip shape and nail type of the robot.
Mr. Sharkey spoke to the publication of the new report: "People laugh them jealously, but the firms are actually epey shipped, and we will see them further.  "
Modern sex dolls have silicone leather, which is hot to touch the comparable ones, made by artificial intelligence, they were married to robots, especially with human reactions.
Users can also customize the robot to fit their own blood by selecting everything from eye color, meme tip shape and nail type or color.
But with the fact that many robots have "personalities" until a Stepford Woman will be innovative, this is a more annoying state.
Modern sex dolls married silicone leather robots.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to customize their own robots according to character specifications (mesela timidity).
Then there are Roxxxy Gold sex robots, including "Frijit Farrah" and "macer" personality developed by True Companion.
True Companion's website is coch: "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that fits your personality as much as possible.  "
So you love it what you like, what you don’t like it, etc.
There are also moods in the day like the same real people.
It can be sleepy, willing to speak or "full mode".
There are many annoying parties on the rise of sex robots: not only real human relations, but with more obeditic female personality features, when approaching Frijit Farah, they are the most thoughtful of rapeful calls.
True Companion on the website resembles Roxxxy to a vibrator, but it is for men.
"If the woman can be a vibrator, why not be the Roxxxy of men," he says the website.
What you have that sex robots are not just a fetish or sex toys.
Their emergence and increased complexity refers to a darker and deep thing in our culture, sex equality is an optional add-on from the ideal to the desire of sex through the neck ecleculation.
Many men will not have sex robots naturally, and FRR pay attention to their growing popularity, they are now located in the outside gangs of consumer culture.
But the leaks from the ends can be a high degree of tutorial on the departure of the period we live.
Many people are not strange or offensive until they give them the right to be so.
The emergence of these sophisticated sex robots in a period where women's rights are threatened around the world, with another who boasts sexually attacking women in White Saray.
The Handmaid's Tale TV series is the most furs creepy side, depicts all the details, clasps or engraved eyes, but how realistic the image feels.
A sudden change in the Republic of Gilead, but it does not feel like it hasn’t been a big change.
The aim behind these sex robots is to create as much physical similarity as possible in the technologically possible women (in the proportions of objects, porno movie stars).
Creatives want them to give human feel and mimic their movements of a real body.
But when work comes to their "personalities", robots can not clearly represent real women.
They can’t leave or leave them.
No activities or past stories, there is nothing to reveal independence or disrupt total slavery fantasy.
In other words, they enjoy slaves.
Or by the subject of 2017: cars.
American military convoy attack: There are dead and wounds...
In the suicide attack held in the Karabakh district of Kabil, the capital of Afghanistan was aimed at foreign military forces operating in the country.
1 NATO military and 3 civilians were announced to be an interpreter working with American soldiers and 1 in the convoy of 5" from wounds.
In the official statement of NATO support forces in Afghanistan (Resolute Support), NATO powers were noted that the intihar bomber invaluated the homemade explosive during the task of a joint patrol with ortak National Army.
The injured staff were announced to treat Bagram Airport at the American Military Hospital.

It is noted that the suicide bomber in the local press is Taliban.
Trump’s great sign?
Mitt Romney shows like a discreet timsali
The micro-scale families of the political division, which polarizes US elections, became the reality of the Trump era.
The newspapers in the US were full of how to deal with the chabus of relatives who voted to Trump.
We all strive to explode our self-filtering bubbles.
If less spoken over Trump’s families bring together strength.
I’m not talking about it because I’m a poet who is left to live in Chicago and are corrupted from the Republicans in our family, this week we visit us in New York.
It reminded me that the merger against a common enemy could have a strong effect.
Anyone who knows that Trump has been involved in the Republican brother who has been preached for decades about politics in the White House, is located on the same side as multiple and strangely.
In the dinner table, this is of course good thing; but it comes to me that in a wide context, it carries important risks.
Left was revitalized by Trump, but the bending effect generated by the other has always created the right push force for me.
When we talk about "Normalization" and Trump, we promise that a day can not be shocked anymore.
Even there is a more horrible long-term scenario, on the tenth, Trump looks like the "normalizes" of the right-makers against its standards and that seems to be the icon of multiple logic.
I find myself that Mitt Romney is experiencing nostalgia related to his madness and its version: the dog on the ceiling of the car, 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax refund looks like), which are really very light crimes based on Trump.
When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate needs to be just at the beginning of the mind to evaluate that it provides measurable degree development.
We took our children at Central Park while in the city of Kuzenim, you need the largest and caffeine of horseshoes operated by New York parks department, or the best three papels you can spend in the city.
Horses are hugely large, fiberglass designs in the central cylinder (hepsi made strange surates, clowns and animals returned to look at the fear of behind their shoulders) and tıngırdayan music cooker and so on.
In other words, many stereotypes of a city can be disappointed: The sights of high buildings begin to be boring, the horizon line starts to be familiar with more excitement and does not reach the reality of the city.
Otuz was five years, and I was still not a Swiss cottage, but I discovered that I discovered that I was a large rotary intersection in North London.
What there is still a awkward experience in Central Park, which is two years old, 11 years old and two women can go here in their 40 and all can have a very good time.
I gave him a full note if I couldn’t give it a note that I couldn’t get it out, but it didn’t ask anyone too much.
On the other hand, this week I was asked to evaluate my credit card from 1 to 5 stars before I had the transaction "experience".
The same thing in the coffee shop in the corner of my street is the option to match a 15% Tip; for what is purchased from the countertop...
The effect of this is not only slowing down that it needs to be an unbiased shopping, but also setting up pressure to give up to a person with no need on the server.
I gave five stars to my eline credit card giving experience while I was secreted like the sad men standing on the poor woman in Bonmarşe.

Red meat can relieve milk products and chocolate IBH
Red meat and chocolate can come as a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims a full otherwise: a rich nutrition from meat-based protein and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms of those suffering from inflammatory intestinal disease.
In the U.S. 1.3 million and in the UK, this untreated health condition leads to stomach cramps and swelling, repeating or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and excessive fatigue.
Although it is recommended to jump meat and dairy products to alleviate the symptoms of patients often, researchers at the University of Washington found that protein is essential aminoasidi triptofanin helps the development of immune cells that develop a durable bond.
Head researcher Dr. Marco Colonna expressed that the microbes stored in the food of immune cells are walking over the intestines to avoid secretly entering the body.
The cells that are causing idiom planning are balanced with cells that promote withstand sensitive tissues without damaging.
If the balance is shifted to inflammation, the inflammatory intestinal disease can be removed.
In experiments, there was a variety of immune cells that promote durability in mice, which carries a specific bacteria in the intestines.
And the bacteria needs a triptofana, one of the building blocks of protein to trigger the emergence of cells.
Professor Colonna: ‘We have linked between the development of cell population, which is part of the microbial microbiom, which promotes durability with Lactobacillus reuteri.’ said.
The mice with more triptofan in their diets had more than this immune cells.
If the same thing happens in people, L. A rich diet in reuteri and triptofan suggested that less iltihabi can develop a intestinal environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas discovered that when working on a kind of immune cell that improves endurance, a group of experiments have such cells of the mouse, but from the same type, and another group held in a different place does not have it.
The differentity was suspected that mice are associated with bacteria, viruses and fungi that live in the gut microbiomes, in other words, normally in the gastrointestinal tract.
DNA secretion of the intestines of mice was made and found that there are six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells, but in mice there is no missing.
A intestinal microbiomu is missing for their views in a sterile environment and L to mice that do not develop such a immune cell. reuteri was given and the immune cells appeared.
In order to understand how bacteria affects the immune system, researchers have grown L. reuteri in liquid, and then transferred the immature immune cells from mice in less quantities from this liquid, which is non-bacterial.
Immune cells become cells that promote endurance.
The active component appeared that the triptofan metabolism, known as indol-3-lactic acid when it is purified from liquid.
When researchers double the amount of triptofan in the nutrients of mice, the number of cells increased around 50 percent, but the number of cells dropped to half when the triptofan levels are halved.
Home Cervantes-Barragan has cells that promote the same durability of people with mice, and most of us are L in the gastrointestinal tract. reuteri expressed hosting.
The triptofan side products from L. reuteri are not known to be developed and developed as in mice in humans, but there are disorders in genes related to triptofan in people with inflammatory intestinal disease.
He spoke with: "This is something we want to possibly promote the development of cells because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.

White House Show Tax Taxpayers Bins Mal Old
According to military records described in TIME, the White Saray’s decision to fly a sea piyadesi helicopter to grass in the south for an organization that highlights the American production last month.
When the President was boarded, the green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One, was the focus of interest in the organization recognized American building programs on July 17 in White Saray.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officers visited the products produced in all 50 provinces.
The helicopter on the Connecticut, a yacht from Main, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississipi.
According to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) responsible for the helicopter; the White House Harp Office requested only 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the southern grass for the organization "extra" (FRAGO is called).
The command of HMX-1 is a day before the organization to the Deputy of the Marine Piyadesi Aviation Commander, "I just wanted to make sure you are aware of because this is an unusual high-visibility organization." A written e-mail sent.
The message stated that the helicopter will arrive at the south grass of July 17, in the morning 7 pm for the organization in 3, and there will be until the lawn was cleaned from 6 to 9 in the evening.
Note, if the exit from the White House is delayed, a second flight team was added to the return flight due to the time limitations of the task.
The unit security staff was in the helicopter during the organization while standing in the air vehicle.
A second flight crew from the registrations provided to TIME does not appear if necessary.
Hatch Law prohibits the use of federal employees for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 does not violate this requirement.
The Commander wrote in the form of "A question that we had not violated the Hatch Law and said that he did not do it."
"You're looking forward." He replied Commander.
The organization "Made in America" is set as an official organization by White Saray and does not enter the scope of Hatch Law.
But even political events are political.
President in the organization, then he spoke to the efforts of the ongoing health care reform in the Senato and praised the efforts of the government arrangement.
Marine One or Air Force One is not a new event that is used for politically advantageous purposes.
Presidents need to use them to travel.
But it is unusual that they are officially asked to use only for a photo withdrawal opportunity.
Trump had taken into account that the presidential plane in Melbourne was behind the scenes of the first campaign miting in Florida and the flood of the Twitter account was filled with messages relating to the use of the other aircraft.
The White Saray press spokesperson Lindsay Walters said: "White Saray is excited about the exhibition 'Made in America', where products made by American workers from all over 50 provinces are made with American materials.  "
HMX-1 crew is often doing educational flights in the Washington region and is doing tasting to leave the US President of the southern grass with point shot to the White Saray.
When Trump was born in Germany for the peak of G-20 at the beginning of July, the HMX-1 White House had 58 flavors.
A competent; The flight for the Made in America organization said that the air crew was considered to be the need for training within that month.
The unit helicopters flew to the additional 11 hours for "non-relevant support tasks" on that day.
White Saray said they didn’t get burdened for any other number in the organization of taxpayers.
A spokesman from Sikorksky said that the helicopter did not participate in companies to adjust its exhibit in the southern grass.
HMX-1 does not hold budget records for the flight of the president, and it is difficult to detect the exact expenses incurred by the organization.
But according to the hourly rates for the financial year of the Ministry of Defense 2017, the ratio of the Ministry of Defense to meet the VH-3D 24.340 per flight time.
Unit records record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes towards both sides from the center base in Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico Virginia.
White Saray helicopter claims that the actual business expenses are very under this rate.
Walters said, "The taxpayers are very misleading to remove a expense based on their cost-to-reach rate predictions."
"This rate estimates cover the western costs in personnel, maintenance and annual expenses.  "
According to a RAND research in 2015, the cost of the Ministry of Defense does not contain personnel expenses but includes fuel, maintenance and contract expenses.
At that time, the former press Secretary of the White House defended the use of Sean Spicer helicopter for this organization.
Spicer said, "To exhibit what is done in America here."
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut province are very proud of the contributions they made in our national security and I think that even hundreds of people are connected to it.
And I think most Americans are proud of all with helicopters and other military equipment that work tirelessly to do.
So, of course, it is convenient to stand out.  "
Trump’s organization isn’t clear to interact with the helicopter while walking the southern grass, but a fire truck stepped into the drive seat.
In the White Saray, Trump was voiced to representatives of Sikorsky, hoping about the company products in his fleet with the media.
The President "I know Cikorsky very well." He said, "There are 3 in them from them.  "
