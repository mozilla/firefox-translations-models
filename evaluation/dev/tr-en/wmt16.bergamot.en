Professor confesses to Killing Your Girlfriend by Calling 911
University Professor Shannon Lamb, who called 911, told the police that he shot his girlfriend with a gun, and that the police had to come to the house, only a little bit of a shivering voice.
Lamb stated that his "cut dog" was alive and possibly sad, and that the parents of the deceased woman's family could be found on the woman's cell phone.
The police found a handwritten note at home to Amy Prentiss' lifeless body and a white notebook: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could make everything come back, I loved Amy very much, and she was the only woman who ever loved me."
Lamb, who taught two online classes for Delta State University in Mississippi, Cleveland, had already traveled 300 miles to the school campus, where the police thought that Ethan Scmidt, the popular professor of history, was shot and killed by Lamb in front of his office.
Lynn Buford, the head of the Delta State University, said that university officials heard a shooting at 10:18.
He also stated that Lamb made the grave 911 call shortly after that.
At the end of the day, another death occurred: Lamb committed suicide when the police approached him.
The day after the school shot caused the students and professors to hide behind the locked doors, the authorities were still investigating what led Lamb to do it.
In addition to the investigators on both sides of the state, the details of the students and staff who knew him and the details of the students and staff drew a picture of a skilled but possibly problematic teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to taking his class.
A police officer in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said there were no criminal and criminal records of Lamb.
In fact, Schmidt referred to Lamb as one of the "great people" he shared his academic life in a book.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, where 17 faculty members were listed, and many students took courses from both.
However, there were signs of mental problems.
Brandon Beavers, one of the students who praised Lamb, noted that he was also a anxious and tense person and that he looked "as if he had a problem."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, stated that Lamb had told him that he was struggling with stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb has previously stated that he had some health problems and asked Delta State University for sick leave.
This year, he was only teaching two online lessons.
Recent changes in the University's recruitment policies could not guarantee that Lamb would automatically become a staffed faculty member, despite the doctoral degree Lamb worked hard to win.
University Dean William LaForge stated that he did not know that there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Lamb had some things in mind."
These are questions that Lamb can't answer anymore.
After the campus was evacuated, police tracked Lamb's trip from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Methel Johnson, director of the Washington County Forensic Investigation, announced that his family committed suicide with a single .38-caliber weapon before he was arrested in the backyard of a house about a mile from his home in the suburbs of Greenville, Greenville.
Lamb's car was found running on the highway.
Although it was not immediately determined why Lamb went to this house, Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people who lived in this house.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb started working at the 3,500 student universities of the city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and education.
He received his Ph.D. in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as a smart, charismatic and fun guy.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 when they met through her mutual friends.
Carla and her friends were in high school, and Lamb was a big one, who tried to teach him how to play guitar for a few years.
He was a fast-hearted-hearted back then.
Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon, said to Lamb, "All the girls would melt when he arrived."
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for a while.
On the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there's no official record of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in brick houses on the edge of a river in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said that they had divorced 15 years ago, but that they were always friends with Prentiss, and that they now have a 19-year-old daughter.
O'Steen also stated that his daughter was completely destroyed.
He and his mother were great friends.
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but that Lamb of his daughter Abigail was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met Lamb three years ago when they performed at a Abigail summer festival.
Then Lamb and Abigail played together at the general shows.
O'Steen stated that he wrote and sang his daughter's music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked in various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartending and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dim bar near Gautier, said that Lamb saw Lamb last on the night of September 5, after finishing playing guitar and harmonica to a small number of viewers.
There was no sign of trouble.
He said they were a very happy couple.
Sometimes we were cutting and throwing a line at each other.
They both had a great sense of humor.
Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the same university, stated that the murdered professor Schmidt was conducting the seminar program for the first-class, and was an expert in the history of the Native Americans and colonial history.
She was married and had three young children.
He graduated from Emporia State University in Kansas, and was also president of a student solidarity group he founded.
On Tuesday night, at the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, about 900 people attended the candle-raising ceremony, including academics, university employees, students and visitors from the locals.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt attended the memorial ceremony, where the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Great Elegance."
Classes continue on Wednesday.
"We are trying to bring our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
Time to heal the wounds.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported it from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus (Greenville, Mississippi) and Rebecca Santana (in New Orleans) contributed to the news.
This text was corrected in a way that the police reported that Lamb had called 911 after he killed Schmidt, and Lamb referred to Prentiss as his "carf," but there was no official evidence that the two had been married.
Toys R Us Plans to Get Less Holiday Season Elements
Toys R Us announced that it will not hire as many holiday seasoners as last year, but the manufacturer of toys and baby products will give its current employees and seasonal workers the opportunity to work harder.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, which was 45,000 during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
Interviews with candidates will begin this month, and the number of staff will increase from October to December, the company said.
Although the holiday season is still months away, the holiday shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees who will equip their stores and help them sell, send and distribute products.
Michael J. Fox Makes Humors with Princess Diana on "Relationship"
The premiere of "Back to the Future" is Michael J. It was a very important moment for Fox.
It was very important for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the cinema hall waiting for members of the Royal Family to arrive, and suddenly I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and I realized that Princess Diana would sit next to me.
The movie started, and I realized that dating Princess of Wales was a fake stretch and arm lift away.
Back in Time, a documentary about "Back to the Future," includes interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and practitioner producer Steven Spielberg.
Return to the Future was first released 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "This is the most exciting time travel film ever made for me."
Back in Time will be shown in VOD and DVD formats as well as some elite cinemas.
UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
Regarding Russia's growing military support for Syria, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that the Syria problem, which has been going on for nearly five years, could not be solved by "military intervention" and that more weapons would only be more violent and bitter for millions of people.
The UN Secretary-General also urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to come together and hold constructive talks to find a political solution to the problem.
At a press conference Wednesday, he said at the UN General Assembly meeting, which will be held by the end of the month, plans to meet Syria with the foreign ministers of the five permanent council members, the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France.
He expressed great regret that the division between the members of the Council and the Syrian people has "insolved the problem" of regional forces.
He invited five permanent members to unite in the Syrian crisis, as in the Iranian nuclear deal.
8 Poll Figures That Showing Donald Trump Is Serious
Some tried to label him as a volcano.
The others got him like a joke.
And some of them are supporting the internal explosion.
Some of the Republicans tried to bring Donald Trump down in polls, but that (hend) did not work.
The last 11 national polls showed him Donald Trump's leadership in double digits, and some are seriously asking for the chances of the real estate emperor running.
It's still early in the election cycle, of course.
None of this means that Trump will be able to win the Republican nominee race.
Experts say that Rick Perry's rise in 2011 led to a rise for Herman Cain, both of which did not win the nomination process in a single state.
And there are many reasons he'll have in the general election.
However, foreign groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC group and the economic conservative group Growth Club, are realizing Trump's permanent strength and are starting to spend their dollars to overthrow it.
Here are some recent survey results here that show that the real estate emperor is not just temporary:
Trump's preferred rates have changed by 180 degrees.
A survey conducted at the University of Monmouth just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June showed that two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion for the real estate emperor.
In mid-July, that was 40 percent.
It was 52% in early August.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a positive opinion about Donald Trump.
Roughly three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are high in the early stages.
A poll in Iowa, Quinnipiac, showed that 60 percent of the Republicans there prefer Donald Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters may be satisfied with the Trump candidacy.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 per cent of Republicans said they would be "wissful" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 said if he was a candidate, they'd "surremp".
It only poses enthusiasm at the same level as Ben Carson Trump (when they say they will be 43 percent "overs," this rate for Trump is 40 percent).
The other person closest to the enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, only 21 percent.
Meanwhile, 47 per cent of Republican voters say that if Jeb Bush, the institution's favorite, is "no satisfaction" or "break".
The majority of the Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been criticised for his flashy language and insults, 52 per cent of Republicans asked according to ABC News/ Washington Post polls on Monday think the real estate emperor has the right temper to become president.
The same figure applies in Iowa, where the country's first party convention will be held, where 52 per cent of Republicans believe that, according to Quinnipac last week, has the personality to lead.
44 per cent still believes that he does not have the personality to serve effectively, and according to ABC/Post, six out of 10 independents say his temperament does not fit the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to that idea.
When they put on their political expert hats, the Republican voters think Trump is serious.
According to a CNN/ORC poll conducted last week, four out of 10 Trump said Trump was the best when asked who was the best candidate to win the GOP nomination.
It's a change from the end of July, when four out of 10 people deposited their money in Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, the crystal ball of the GOP voters was not very clear.
In the last election cycle at the time, four out of 10 Republicans thought that Rick Perry would run, while only 28 percent of them chose Mitt Romney, who was eventually nominated.
The majority of the GOP voters still seem to be plausible for Trump's campaign.
Even if the Republicans gather around another candidate, Trump is still beating almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the messy area can also contribute to Trump's stand out, and it is also a fact that anti-Trump support has been disbanded among more than a dozen candidates.
However, a Monmouth University survey in early September shows that Trump has received the support of the majority every time, in the event of a possible match between Trump and many Republican candidates.
He beat Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points.
With Ted Cruz.
The only candidate that can beat him?
In case of a possible head-to-head, Ben Carson beats the businessman by 19 points.
The vast majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made their decisions.
A new CBS/NYT poll, released on Tuesday, shows that more than half of the voters supporting Trump have locked their votes.
Frankly, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can say that he's really going to change his mind.
He said they left the door open to replace 46% of the candidates.
Trump's biggest rival is still neurosurgeon, Ben Carson, but voters who say they've made their decisions are twice as close to voting for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump about immigration.
Since Donald Trump called migrants from Mexico in his campaign advert two months ago, the issue at and at the center of the 2016 conversations was immigration.
Some believe that Trump's many speech has driven important Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and will damage their efforts to re-brand.
According to the new ABC/Post poll on Monday, however, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as the immigration issue remains on the agenda, it seems that Trump will remain on the agenda.
The government is escalating to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are roughly receiving half of the Republican votes due to their largely external situation.
In the new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of every 10 Republicans say they want someone from outside instead of someone with government experience.
And they're angry at Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll conducted in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of every four Republicans in Iowa were angry with the Republicans in Congress, 54 per cent were "unsatisfied" and 21 per cent were "extremely angry".
In Prime Minister's Questions, Jeremy Corbyn will take the stand for the first time
Since the day he was elected, Mr. Corbyn's departure to the Prime Minister's Questions program was eagerly expected
Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the New Labour Party, will take the stand for the Prime Minister's Questions after David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will ask six questions shortly after the afternoon, and his performance seems to be closely examined by the media and the Labour Party MPs.
In weekly show, he called for "less theater and more real."
He also said he could skip some sessions by leaving them to his colleagues.
This will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbyn's leadership, the shadow cabinet, and his speech at the TUC annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's silence during the reading of the national anthem at the memorial ceremony to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the British War on Tuesday has been criticised by some Tory MPs and the focus of front-page news in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to accompany the national anthem draws attention
Speaking on behalf of Mr. Corbyn, a spokesman said that he stood in a "respectful silence" and appreciated the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England."
Owen Smith, a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, told the BBC Two's News Night programme that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "independently" from his belief in the elimination of the monarchy.
Due to differences in economics, defence and foreign relations, he refused to serve on the top team of Mr. Corbyn, who looked at about a dozen shadows, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that policy differences within the Labour Party have also begun to "drill", including Mr. Corbyn's appointment over the position in the European Union and the government's upper limit implementation of aid.
Mr. Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party has made new changes to lift the upper limit altogether.
Hours later, the minister of shadow and retirement, Mr. Smith, said that the party was only opposed to lowering the upper limit of 26,000 to 23,000 s, and that it was "very open" in this regard.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader of David Cameron to meet on the avam chamber from the moment he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labour Party pledged a different approach to politics and said he had received more than 30,000 recommendations to ask Mr. Cameron of the "people".
Islington North MP told the Prime Minister that the Questions programme is multi-frontative and will focus on poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people, rather than exchange sarcastic words with "response."
Mr. Corbyn, when he was not himself, for example, when Mr. Cameron traveled abroad, he said that he would be represented by shadow trade minister Angela Eagle in the Questions program to the Prime Minister.
From time to time, he even suggested that other colleagues should take the stand and asked the House of Commons Spokesman John Bercow to discuss the issue.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron often stated that he wanted to move away from politics in the "Game Game" style, which was often associated with the Questions program to the Prime Minister, but confessed to failing to do so a few years later.
Since its first publication in 1990, the Prime Minister's Questions programme has been used as a basic measuring point for measuring the determination of the leaders, their dominance in the House of Commons and their position among MPs, while some critics have said that it has been caricatured and that extensive reforms are needed.
'Regared in Joburg': Homeless youths are studying photography
The city center of Johannesburg is a challenging place for homeless.
But a group of old street children has found a way to earn a new talent and make a living.
I was shot in Joburg, a nonprofit studio that taught homeless teenagers to take pictures of their neighborhoods and earn income from it.
BBC News went to meet one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds rise as wage increases in the UK
Following data showing that wages in the United Kingdom increased, the pound saw a rapid rise in pounds, while the FTSE 100 index rose after the purchase offer for SABMiller.
Fees, excluding premiums in the United Kingdom, increased by 2.9% between May and July compared to the same period of the previous year.
This rate, which refers to the fastest increase since 2009, is also seen as one of the leading indicators for possible interest increases.
The pound rose to $1,505, earning more than 1% against the US dollar, and a value of 1.84% against the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 Index increased by 1.49% to a score of 6.229.21.
The most prominent company in this rise was SABMiller, which has increased by 20% with its attractive purchase offer from its rival EU InBev.
This offer will merge the world's two largest beer companies and well-known brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch will meet under the same roof.
Burberry shares rose by 0.9% due to positive profit news from rival luxury retailing group Richemont.
Richemont's current sales figures have shown that sales have risen again in China, one of the key markets for Burberry, as well as surpassing expectations.
The shares of mining giant Glencore rose by 5% after declaring that it had achieved $2.5 billion in the sale of the company's allocation shares under the company's strategy to reduce its debts.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were among the most devalued shares with a loss of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs reduced his proposal for the company to "Sat."
JD Sports's stake rose by 3.1% after the company announced that the company's six-month pre-tax profits rose by 83% to 46.6 million pounds.
JD Sports boss says higher salaries can damage expansion
Peter Cowgill, Chairman of the JD Sports Board, said that the higher minimum wage for workers in the UK could mean "more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers."
However, he said that his spending power could not exceed the high employee expenses of his own company.
He added that the costs would affect JD Sports' expansion plans, which could mean less extra work.
Metcash launches a public campaign to fight the Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect IGA stores in South Australia and Western Australia from an Aldi attack.
The market wholesaler Metcash launched a public campaign to defend retail stores in South Australia and Western Australia against the $700 million invasion of Aldi.
At the beginning of next year, Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and stores with their number of stores in South Australia and Western Australia, while Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationship with local food suppliers and trying to create the IGA brand with mainstream and social media marketing and events such as Adelaide fair.
IGA partners and suppliers also contribute with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo, which offers taste test in IGA stores, and with store owners who sell South Australia football league tickets to their loyal customers.
Metcash, a food, drink and hardware wholesaler, is expected to present more details about the defence strategy as the annual investor strategy improves on September 29th.
The risk is large, because South Australia and Western Australia represent almost 30% of Metcash's IGA store footprint and produce higher profit margins than the IGA network in the eastern states of Metcash.
South Australia and Western Australia store owners are negatively narrow-minded and IGA retailers enjoy a much stronger market share than they have in NSW, Victoria and Queensland; 30% in GA and 24% more in the BA than they have gained.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take over about 5% of the market market within 12 months of opening his first stores in these two states, and that he will be taken from the current players but generally the unpredictable retailers.
In a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath predicted that IGA retailers would lose $360 million in a year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This estimate is based on Aldi's estimate that he will open 25 stores in GA and 30 stores in BA next year, and will get a sales figure of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
Mr. Kierath said that the loss of food and market sales and Metcash's high fixed cost base volumes could cost Metcash interest and about $13 million before tax.
Metcash also loses market share in eastern states, primarily Aldi and Coles, despite the recent recent Roy Morgan research, which reveals that IGA customers are the most loyal customers.
According to Morgan Stanley, Metcash's food and market sales will decrease by 4.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, which will reduce its market share from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, said at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash could "most likely be wiped out within ten years".
Metcash refused to respond to Mr. Douglass' comments.
But it appears that a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
The IGA's market share has declined from 18% to 14% since 2010, and Metcash's earnings from food and grocery business, which supply to about 1200 IGA retailers, have dropped by 43% since 2012, an indication that the market leverage has decreased as sales and margins are under pressure.
But the wholesaler resists, invests more than $150 million a year for shelf prices that match the product every week at Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA retailers to renew their stores, adding faster-growing fresh foods, and opening a better range of private labeled market markets to the public.
Ian Morrice, chairman of the executive board of Metcash, says that price matching and store renewal programmes have begun to yield results, and the wholesaler is expected to return to basic profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by Steve Healy, President of Tennis Australia
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise for his behavior than criticism.
According to Steve Healy, the president of Tennis Australia, Thanasi Kokkinakis, was accidentally damaged in the last storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and deserves more praise than criticism.
Kokkinakis, a young member of the talented duo, who is normally referred to as "Special K's," found himself under the spotlights that did not welcome him because Kyrgios crushed Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal Masters in a shameful manner.
During the afternoon's tough qualifier match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison left by the net referee twice, Harrison said: "Wawrinka came on Kyrgios and I have to go after that boy."
Kokkinakis, who was last seen at the US Open breaking his racket to potentially upset Richard Gasquet, was faithfully defended by Healy.
The young player is currently competing with Sam Groth in Glasgow for the second singles behind Bernard Tomic against Britain in the Davis Cup semifinals.
"What I feel so enthusiastic is that I think that Thanasi is being discussed," Healy said.
He broke his racket when he closed and lost in the U.S., but he's not the first player to break a racket because he's disappointed in himself, and I know Thanasi is well aware that he shouldn't be proud of it.
But in reality, in the United States, under highly provocative circumstances with Harrison and others, he handled himself quite well, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's got a great team, a great family around him, and I think he's a little too much.
Although he is 19 years old, he is extremely mature, he works hard, and adapts to the team, he has no problems with other players, he is well received with respect in the locker room, he is a hard workout, he is a very balanced and mature young man, and in my opinion, he deserves to be tried in his own crests.
Healy also supported the decision to tolerate Kyrgios for significant draw; from Friday, he began to explain that what was right for everyone was to "take a mutual decision" but to support Canberran to return to the team as a long-term fixture.
"First of all, we want the team to focus on the match altogether, not the strife around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And to me, as people like Nick, Federer and Murray pointed out, the child rose very fast, he grew up in front of the public, and he made some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and sometimes when he's not under the spotlights, he thinks it's right, that he's the best for the team and himself.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Hungary declared an emergency Tuesday to cut off the flow of migrants, closing the southern border with Serbia and detained those trying to enter the country illegally.
With hundreds of migrants piling up in the neutral zone, causing chaos at the border and Serbian officials acted out of rage.
Equity fleeing violence in their own country, between the checkpoints of the two countries, set up tents on the side of the road for an indefinite time and settled in these tents.
But their anger was growing.
As a police helicopter passed by, the migrants shouted, "Open the border!" and insulted the Hungarian riot police.
Others refused to protest the water and food given to them.
As the flow of migrants from Macedonia and Greece continues, Hungary's return of migrants is "unacceptable", he said.
(Serbia) wants to be a part of the solution, not to be damaged by this process.
In the coming days, talks will be needed with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
This tension at the Hungarian-Serbia border occurred just a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a joint migrant policy at a meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share the responsibility for the 40,000 migrants who attacked Greece and Italy, and hoped that by next month or the end of the year, an agreement would be reached to accept more than 120,000 more migrants from Hungary to EU countries.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for an EU summit next week to discuss this migration crisis facing the continent.
Hungary, on the other hand, is not hopeful that Brussels or its neighbours will take any concrete steps on the issue.
The emergency call in the two southern regions on Tuesday gives authorities extensive powers to fight the crisis, including closing the roads and accelerating asylum seekers' cases.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said his country plans to draw barbed wire along its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants from this country after the barbed wire on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata announced that even prisoners in prisons were deployed in barbed wire drawing between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become an important narrow crossing and transit point to the European Union countries, and most of these migrants are asylum seekers fleeing wars in Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that most of the incoming migrants are "economic migrants" who are trying to move to Europe for a better life than innocent people who come to escape from war - this idea is completely contrary to the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
The laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, bring heavier punishment for human traffickers, as well as overcoming or harming the 4m (13 feet) lengthed barbed wire drawn to the Serbian border.
"The Hungarian government is calling an emergency because of the situation caused by mass migration," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear on one subject: it is a crime to cross the border illegally.
Although the deployment of troops must yet be approved by parliament, Associated Press reporters in the region say they have seen soldiers with dogs and vehicles equipped with heavy weapons for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's domestic security adviser, said authorities have captured 15 people who have crossed the border with 45 people trying to cross the border.
They passed by damaging barbed wires, now under police supervision and new laws, they are accused of committing crimes.
Authorities are quickly repairing barbed wire.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossing points with Serbia on Tuesday morning, while using a barbed wire-covered train car to close one of the crossings.
The chaos was also reflected at the main border crossing point near Roszke, as the Hungarians put into commissioning a small metal container where people were crowded to make transactions.
Twenty people were able to get in, but thousands were out.
Another group of migrants said they would not accept food and water assistance until they were allowed to enter Hungary by closing the highway connecting Serbia and Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's superiority over Bernie Sanders halved in national elections
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues his two-digit leadership in the Democratic race for national nomination, but you. Bernie Sanders catching up to him.
Clinton is currently second in position with 47% of Democratic votes (lost from 58%) and Sanders is second with 27% (updating from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is in the presidential race, receives 15% of democratic votes.
Over the next five months before the start of the main races, most Democrat voters said it was too early to decide which candidate to support.
But Clinton's supporters have stronger ideas about their choice than other candidates.
Clinton's been losing ground between a series of demographic groups since CBS News last month, and Sanders has some gains.
Clinton's ahead with a big difference between women and moderates, but that difference is closing.
The support between men has dropped largely, and Sanders follows him only 5 points from behind.
Clinton's Democratic electorate under the age of 50 has evaporated, and he and Sanders are now in equal position.
Clinton, however, is a big difference in the right for the elderly voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sander with two digits between the liberals, but now Sanders is five points ahead of this group.
At the national level, nearly half of the democratic voters say they will passionately support Clinton if the party's candidate.
While a quarter of it supports under certain circumstances, another 15 per cent will support it only if it is a candidate.
A six percent people don't support Clinton.
Perhaps, not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters tend to support him with passion.
The views among those who are not currently supporting Clinton are even more complicated - only the quarter can support him passionately.
While 48 per cent of Democrats say they will support Clinton passionately, fewer Republican candidates speak about Donald Trump (35 per cent).
When asked why Clinton's supporters were asked open-ended questions about why Clinton wanted to run, the first responses were the right experience (16 per cent), the idea that it was now time to elect a female president (13 per cent) and the best candidate for the job (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters also voice his relationship with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
Being compromising on problems and selectability are among the criteria specified.
As a vice-president with potential for the presidency, 57 per cent of Democratic voters may want to see him in the race, but a third of them do not think so.
When demoktrat voters are asked what the second nomination for the party is, Biden ranks top.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say that according to Sander, Biden may have a clear second election.
If Biden does not enter the Democratic Candidate, Hillary Clinton's superiority over Sanders increases; Biden's 20-point level in a race with Biden rises to 30 points in a race without Biden.
Fifty per cent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the best chance of winning the general election, but that number fell from 78 per cent last month to this level.
From this point of view, Biden was second, but the percentage of those who saw him as the most selectable candidate increased.
When asked what is the most important thing in a candidate, Democratic voters put issues ahead of selectability.
Similar to the last month, no Democratic candidate or candidate is unacceptable for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or candidates perform well among their own party's primary voters at some main characteristics.
The majority see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and reliable, as well as strong leadership skills.
In terms of honesty, Clinton is strong in leadership when he's number three.
Clinton is not honest and reliable, according to thirty percent of the Democrat voters, and 27 per cent do not have an idea about it, while half of them say the same for Sanders (15 per cent).
Democratic voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden in line with their ideology.
In all the criteria, a quarter of the Democrat voters have no idea about Sanders.
As questions continue to use the personal e-mail address and server during the post of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, most Democrat voters find the statement satisfactory and say that their views on it are not affected.
But it's a different story in the general American public opinion.
Half of the Americans are no longer satisfied with his explanations, but only a third finds it satisfactory.
The public's views on this issue were divided in March shortly after the problem was taken under the lens.
Most American e-mail strifes say they don't affect their general views on Clinton, while on the other hand, negative opinions have increased over 36 per cent.
These are the Republicans in general, and more than six in 10 people say their views on Clinton are broken.
Although Clinton is regarded as honest and reliable by his party's voters, this issue is still a problem in general: only 32% of them consider him honest and reliable, while this number has dropped eight points compared to last month and 15 points since May.
Sixty percent of registered voters don't find him honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55 per cent of registered voters across the country do not find Trump honest and reliable.
Both Clinton and Trump, however, take good notes on leadership.
Among the six candidates who took the test, Biden, Carson and Bush scored the best on honesty.
More often find Sanders honest, but like Carson, most of them don't have any ideas about him.
The margin margin of error in samples taken from 351 Democratic voters is 6%.
Ben Carson is right behind Donald Trump in national polls
According to the latest CBS News/New York Times poll, Ben Carson runs behind Donald Trump
The new poll shows that about half of the two candidates correspond to the vote, and the other candidates do not have much chance
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, and your support, which was 23% in the last CBS poll before the Fox News debate last month, is climbing to 27% in Tuesday's survey.
Carson's support, however, rose from 6% to 23% during the same period.
The survey also found that Carson was doing very well in demographic groups, and that the support among university-educated Republican voters was much higher than Trump.
The rest have dropped from 10 per cent last month to 2%, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, Governor of Wisconsin, to 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are third with 6%.
The error margin of this latest survey, with 376 voters selected among Republican voters, was 6% and the survey was conducted in September.
Last week's latest CNN/ORC poll showed Carson's support for Republicans to 19%, just behind Trump's 32% support.
The latest poll conducted by ABC News/Washington Post has seriously shown Trump ahead of Carson.
Faced with Carson's rise last week, Trump apologized for questioning Carson Trump's faith, but continued to randomly shake it to a retired neurosurgeon.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday at a campaign stop in Iowa.
Five fraternity members accused of the death of a freshman at Baruch College
During the admission of a brotherhood in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were sued for murder almost two years after the death of a college student.
The New York City Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternified violently attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a September 2013 start ritual, and according to the police, he delayed taking him to the hospital, contributing to his death.
Authorities reported that he was blindfolded, a backpack full of 30 lybreeds of sand was caught on his back, and he was constantly tripping while trying to walk towards the target on a frozen field.
Mr. Deng filed a complaint stating that over time his head hurts and later unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity, did not call 911 after Deng fainted, and according to the police, they waited an hour before they took him to the hospital.
However, according to Police Commissioner Chris Wagner, who spoke at the press conference, they changed Deng's clothes, Googled their symptoms, and contacted Andy Meng, the national president of the brotherhood, asking for advice.
At this point, Lieutenant Wagner said that the members began to hide personal belongings and put the favor of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng.
He was uncompromising, and the next morning he died.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered traumas from repeated blows with a non-stricken object in his head, torso and hip.
Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement that many families were destroyed as a result of the Brotherhood acceptance ceremonies, and since 1970, at least one student dies in admission ceremonies.
Brotherhoods and members should be held responsible for this issue, and this step taken by the authorities is very important.
The Monroe Town grand jury has advised the first five members to be sued for murder in the third degree.
Thirty-two fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with an initiation for the attack and criminal conspiracy.
At a press conference Tuesday, Wagner said, we will hold them responsible, not only those involved, but if there is an organization that formally or unofficially confirms it.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the national fraternity ended its relationship with this local unit.
What will happen when the Fed increases interest rates?
With interest rates rising, the bull market is upside down and bond revenues are climbing, and the economy also records regression.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna take to get and how long it's gonna take.
History offers very little information about timing, especially in the economy.
The decline has been as long as 86 months, as well as in a short period of 11 months after the initial interest rate increase.
The U.S. Central Bank's aggressiveness in increasing interest rates has often been decisive in the reaction of the economy and financial assets, although not continuous.
This is why US central bank officials strongly emphasize that investors should focus not when interest rates are starting to increase, but rather how long the normalization process will take.
It's a fact that there are various variables.
But the result, market participants may think that the rush of interest increase has been exaggerated.
"Since the global financial crisis, the Fed's first interest increase is inevitable by some to indicate that the 'cheap money' period has come to an end," said Capital Economics Global Chief Economist Julian Jessop.
On the contrary, we do not expect US interest rates to gradually return to normal, but it is seen that most of the levels still low are terrified seismic pulses.
But we can't say it won't have any effect.
Based on past trends, the reaction of some areas of the economy can be reacted:
As seen in the market in the past months, waiting for interest rates to be increased can destabilize things for a while.
The effect is not so pronounced as the time the interest is increased.
"The equity returns are seen to be a pause trend for 12-24 months after the initial interest increase, which may reflect the pause in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a new study on what will happen after the Fed increase.
According to a recent analysis shared by Nuveen Asset Management analyst Bob Doll at Barron's, the market has generally risen sharply over the past 35 years - around 14 per cent - and 250 days later, it's progressing in a straight line (the average 2.6 per cent increase) and 500 days has returned to normal and averaged 14.4 per cent in the last six cycles.
The impact on the shares is becoming more evident in the next stages of the interest-raising cycle, Deutsche said, suggesting that the return is facing extinction.
Regressions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases also help them.
The Fed is facing some situations that were not previously present and will accelerate the regression.
The most notable is that gross domestic product is at the lowest level to date for the Fed interest increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, the gross domestic product from nominal to year-on-year fell only two times less than 4.5 per cent in the 118 interest rate increase since 1950.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, according to the Atlanta Fed, it is expected that it will be permanent by very few, and the third quarter is at 1.5 percent.
According to Deutsche, increasing interest rates in such a sensitive economic environment can be risky and can lead to the question of "will it be different this time?"
The attention of market participants waiting for the Fed's interest increase for a year is at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which will end on Thursday.
Although most strategists and economist FOMC believes that he can approve an increase in this meeting, futures trade points only 25 per cent possible.
"In our research since 1950, all the increase cycles that have taken to the present day are in a super-rising trend cycles and rapidly reaching the peaks before the decline after the recovery, which began," the report said.
On the contrary, this was a recovery of unprecedented slowness without the worst regression that occurred at an exemplary period.
The current cycle was the longest cycle Fed has been waiting for since the last regression - the longest cycle in the recording was 35 months, and the cycle we are in is 74th month and still continues.
With the expectation of an interest rate increase in the market, the fixed income has also destabilized, and the order is similar to that of the equity.
The main difference is that when the Fed policy changes its course, the effect is seen faster than in the bonds.
When the first increase/fall of the cycle comes, bond returns do not change direction immediately.
At the end of the interest increase cycle, bond returns fall instantly," Deutsche said.
According to Charles Schwab strategists, interest rates will bring the yields closer between the longer and shorter bonds, and the slope will straighten.
In analysis, we, Kathy Jones, one of Schwab analysts, said that high-income bonds usually perform better in such an environment, but he said, "We are still careful about reaching the return."
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already adapting to the Fed's policy expectations.
"In addition to the decline in dollar power and inflation expectations, there are several signals that the market is regulated according to stricter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the yield curve is smooth, credit spreads have expanded, and the fluctuation has increased - all the features that will be seen on the market when the Fed tightens the policy.
From a wide perspective, companies that do most of their business in the United States will earn as interest rates will increase and local products will be more attractive.
The situation of multinational companies with a lot of debt will be worse, because the rising dollar products will make it more expensive in the global market, and their debts will be even more expensive.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks can experience performance deficiencies at the beginning of such an increase," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for its customers.
Companies with strong balance sheets surpassed the weak balance sheet with an average of 5 per cent following the 1994, 1999 and 2004 rate increases.
Companies with high-capital return and low fluctuating stocks also surpassed their low-quality competitors with a 3 per cent (percent) average.
Debt will become a big matter.
According to Goldman, companies with high-voltage exchange rate debts are candidates for the most damage.
Apart from the safi stock market game, consumers are also expected to benefit from the rising dollar.
Although experts have different opinions on how fast they will keep, savings can also profit from high gains.
Andrew Bingham says a copy of BBC Radio 3 Classic FM
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses station of "rule"
He argues that the radio has become increasingly unspecified to commercial competitors
He also targeted BBC Music Awards and accused him of cheating the Brit Awards
His surrogate friend Damien Collins accuses The Voice of not being original
A prominent surrogate pressured the publisher to reveal his difference to other commercial stations, saying that BBC Radio 3 was increasingly "transforming" to Classic FM.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham said that the radio station, which provides public service to BBC bosses, is "nears" and is increasingly dissecting from its commercial opponents.
"I don't like to use this phrase, but Radio 3 has become "last" and gradually turns into Classic FM."
In addition, the first targeted the BBC Music Awards last December.
Another version of the BBC Music Awards Brit Awards, which was launched last year.
"I mean, if you're trying to do something different, these are the first two examples that come to my mind, whereas you're holding it and copying the same thing that already exists on the market," Bingham said.
The BBC general manager rejected accusations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was by far ahead of its commercial competitors on both live music and public education.
If I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm not going to learn something about classical music from somewhere else.
And that's devotion to live music, and making music can't be compared with anything else.
I also think that the effort of Radio 3 to explore new music and promote works is very important.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 director Alan Davey claimed that in order to reach more audiences, the radio had to work harder than the past, because the British were less educated in the field of classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only component of the BBC at the election committee of Culture, Media and Sports, which was hit by the BBC's queue of commercial competitors.
MP Tory Damien Collins also teased O Ses - the BBC's Dutch production company Talpa Media for a music talent contest, which received its royalties for 22 million pounds.
Can't you see why the program makes so much noise, because it's not original and there's no special difference?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 Show, which Paloma Faith and Boy George were judged, was made "in a BBC-specific style."
He said he wished the institution "get a hit out of his own blood" before he made the entertainment program again.
However, he did not agree with the idea of preventing the construction of more O Audio programs in the future, or the amount spent on the license fee would be spent on other formats.
Is Black Friday the reason why internet sales experience the lowest increase in history in August?
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in internet sales
The lowest growth has been recorded since 2000, when records began to break last month
There was an explosion in internet sales three years before mobile devices were used in shopping
Experts say Black Friday in November could be the cause of cutage of spending
Online shopping has been booming for over a decade, and it has transformed England's most vibrant shopping streets into ghost towns.
After showing a seven-percent increase in internet sales in the first three months of 2015, experts say that internet sales give signs of increasingly slimming.
The total expenditure amount in August was only a five-per cent increase compared to last year, and the lowest growth has been seen since 2000, when records began to break.
After the figures showing that there was only a seven percent increase in internet sales in the first trimester of 2015, experts say that internet sales are increasingly dampening signs
"If you look at the growth levels of the previous years and especially 2000, you'll see that everything has returned to normal in time," IMRG sales index editor Andy Mulcahy told the Guardian.
He added that internet sales increased a huge increase three years before consumers started using their mobile phones to buy products.
That meant that more and more people could shop even when they were lying on the couch.
But now it's going horizontally, you can see the landing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, a concept taken from America, is cited as one of the reasons for slowing down sales.
To buy something, experts say, consumers may be waiting for this event, which took place on the last Friday of November.
At last year's event, many companies' sites collapsed when five times more consumers attacked companies' websites to grab cheap products compared to the previous year.
Experts say Black Friday may have "for now" reins the shoppers for now, showing shoppers fighting for discounts
A study published by the British Retailers' Association revealed that 1 pound of every 5 pounds spent on shopping was spent on buying products from the internet.
A third of the products, such as TV and washing machine, are now purchased from internet stores.
In addition, more than a quarter of people buy their clothes and shoes online instead of luxury and fancy shopping streets.
With the found of the Bin Laden family guilty, Muslims send off their last journey to the crane accident in Mecca
The bodies of 29 people who died after the first funerals in Mecca were carried on the streets by Muslims
Saudi Arabia blames construction giant Saudi Binladin as responsible for crane accident
A total of 394 people were injured after the fall of the crane, the health ministry reported
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to carry the bodies of 29 people who lost their lives when a crane fell to the Sacred Mosque.
Mostly the crowds in whites blocked their first funerals to their last journey to the Muaysım Cemetery in Mecca.
A few days ago, the painful mass crossed the sacred place where a crane destroyed the roof of the masjid and overturned over the pilgrims.
In the case of 394 injured, the bodies of the dead were brought to burial after the Saudi Kingdom's construction conglomerate held the Binladin family responsible.
The bodies of 29 pilgrims who lost their lives when a crane fell into the Sacred Mosque were carried on the shoulders along the way
Among the dead were the fathers of four children from Manchester's Bolton region, which was the first pilgrimage when the crane fell, Kasım Akram.
Mr. Akram came to Masjid al-Haram with his parents at the beginning of the year's Hajj.
Saudi leaders have announced that the pilgrimage will continue with the participation of thousands of pilgrims on the way to Mecca.
In today's statement, King Salman said that the Binladin Holding group should not leave the rod of the crane open when it is out of use.
The Arab version of the edict prepared by the state-run Saudi Press Agency stated that the Binladin Group was the only party to be accused of the incident.
The news agency's English service did not pass this detail, but the company officials reported a ban on going abroad.
At the beginning of the week, Salman took an appointment for the crane to find the reason for the fall of the Sacred Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims arrived by Hajj at the end of the month.
Binladin group did not make any statements about the overturned crane, and its representatives were not allowed to comment.
The royal decree accused the group of not taking current security measures and co-operating with meteorological authorities.
The Masjid al-Haram, located in Mecca, is surrounded by dozens of cranes, which is mostly under the management of the Binladin group.
For decades, the Binladin family has been in close relations with the Saudi Arabian executive family, and most of them are the head of the construction project.
Al Qaeda's last leader, Osama Bin Laden, was also a deviant son who was disintincted from the family's disinfection.
The accident occurred only a few days before millions of raids on the land of Hajj, which is obligatory for each adult Muslim to visit at least once in their lives, during a heavy wind and rain.
Authorities reported that 158 people are still being treated in the hospital.
Authorities have instructed the families of the deceased and 1 million Riyals (174,000 pounds) to be compensated for those who survived the permanent disability.
The other wounded will take half of this amount.
B&Q boss says there are Eastern European craftsmen behind this trend
Veronique Laury says the British are recruiting more and more masters
The number of Eastern European craftsmen lies behind this increase
As a result, 200 new Screwfix stores are opening targeting craftsmen
Kingfisher also closes 60 B&Q out of the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, Daily Mail City Lead Reporter
It is said that the British are dismissed by leaving the hammers and paintbrushes in their hands and the skilled Eastern European craftsmen to do the work in their home
If you are skilled in using hammers or skilled in painting walls, then you are in the minority these days.
Because according to the boss of the company behind B&Q, the British are increasingly working as masters to do DIY work in their homes.
Veronique Laury, the new general manager of Kingfisher, the owner of the home recovery chain, said there is a huge increase in the number of Eastern European skilled craftsmen who offer services at low prices behind this trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores for craftsmen while closing the 60 B&Q outlet.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted more women to be hired at B&Q stores because eight of the ten purchases in the store were made by women.
At the moment, the majority of the staff is male.
He said there is a need to meet the developing demographic trends in the single women's house, which has made more home improvements compared to the past.
"Our stores still work mostly by men.
We need to build even more balance.
Basically, half of our customers are made by women and 80 per cent of the decisions on the purchased products are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laury, one of the five women in charge of the UK's leading firms index FTSE100, restructured her top team to consist of an equal number of male and female directors.
With a total of 50 per cent of his team, including Kingfisher, general manager and financial director, almost alone in this field with a staff of women.
"This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It wasn't hard to find the good women to take on our board of directors.
After the group had loaded down the cost of closed stores, Kingfisher announced a decrease in both the lower-month profit and sales.
Kingfisher, owner of Screwfix and B&Q as a result of trend, will open 200 new stores
Time to decide on interest increase for the US Central Bank FED
The two-day meetings of the US Central Bank, which continue on Wednesdays and Thursdays, are monitored by the whole world, and a decision is expected to be made to increase interest rates after ten years.
In a survey conducted by Reuters, a little more than half of the 80 economists said the Fed would implement the decision last week, while now they think it will suspend the decision and keep the rates between 0-0.25 per cent.
Since it has been seven years since the Fed has reduced rates to zero, this is a historic event.
"For the first time, we will see a large central bank exiting the zero point and normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, a senior researcher at Peterson's Institute of International Economy.
The U.S. economy has a relatively good performance and the balance sheet is added to the balance sheet in the process of revitalising the economy, creating a small amount of inflation.
But the FED cannot ignore the less promising global picture.
He warned the markets of an increase, but there are indications that they believe the situation will not allow such an increase.
The decision will be announced Thursday at 20:00.
The perpetrator of the murder at Delta State University left an apology letter
On Tuesday, according to officials, Shannon Lamb left a note saying Monday morning in Mississippi that it was "upday" for the first murder, after killing his girlfriend with a gun and killing his colleague later that he had killed his colleague.
Mississippi Gautier police, Lamb, an instructor at Delta State University for geography and social sciences, called 911 at 10:00.
He said he said he killed Monday and someone with a gun.
Lamb said he should send the police to the phone attendant.
"I killed my wife last night," Lamb said, adding that there was also a "sweet dog that didn't harm anyone" at home and that he was probably upset.
The police asked the caller, but he didn't mention his name.
Lamb didn't explain anything about the murder.
When the police went to the scene, he came across a note written by 41-year-old Amy Prentiss' lifeless body and 45-year-old Lamb: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could take back the time.
I loved Amy, and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After writing this note, Lamb drove her car to Delta State, 300 miles away, killing history professor Ethan Schmidt, and then killed him when the police trapped him.
University Dean William LaForge stated that he did not know that there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Lamb had some things in mind."
Despite reports Monday that Lamb believed that his girlfriend Prentiss was also having an emotional relationship with Schmidt, officials said on Tuesday that they had no "wide information or evidence" that they had a "love triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for about seven years, describes Prentiss as "a good person."
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but they kept friends.
O'Steen said that Prentiss and a 19-year-old daughter were found and that the girl was "destructed."
O'Steen also stated that Prentiss and his daughter were "definitely the best friend of each other."
According to Linsday Knowless, Sun Herald described as a close friend of Parentiss's prentumn, he worked online from his home.
Knowles said that Prentiss, a hunting dog named Lightning, had been with Lamb for about three years.
"He always loved helping others," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called his relatives on Monday, saying "I'm not going to go to jail."
On Highway 1, the same night the police approached him on Highway 1, and Lamb pulled over, jumped on foot, ran into the woods, and shot himself with a gun, committed suicide.
According to a CV published on the University's website, Lamb received a Ph.D. degree in studying at Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars that have lost their old charm
His son Redmond (right) had several years of stressful years.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009, he sacrificed his life partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer.
The actor, who was said to be dealing with drugs, was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
All of this has harmed him, of course.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United is out for months with a double fracture
Luke Shaw's right leg suffered two fractures in Manchester United's loss to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League.
This incident, which sheds tears over the defender, will leave him out of the field for at least six months, while Louis van Gaal Shaw is hopeful that he will be able to return to the field this season.
The break was caused by 20-year-old Shaw's embezzlement with Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute of the match where he hit the field like a bomb.
It was intervened in the field for nine minutes, and then oxygen was required before being transferred to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "On his leg, he's suddenly broken, and he's in the hospital."
Today or one day, he may be dispatched and taken into surgery in Manchester.
It's a terrible situation -a young man who transferred to Manchester at the age of 18, let him have a hard time first, then you have a great game, and then this will happen to him.
He had an oxygen mask on his face when he was in the locker room.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a break from the ground, that's at least six months, and that means you can't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky to get rid of the red card and the penalty shootout.
The referee Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal claimed the Italian official made a mistake.
When I say it's a penalty and a red card, you can judge yourself.
It was a terrible struggle with two legs.
"Thanks to all of you for your messages, words are not enough to describe how much I've been disappointed, my healing path begins now, I will return with strength."
Related: Luke Shaw in Manchester United PSV defeat suffers from the shock of his injury
The Champions League, which will be held in France next July, will be morale for the recovery of the English defender.
PSV manager Phillip Cocu said: "A very bad injury."
If such a migrant incident happens to any player, everyone will be upset about it.
Our players never intend to cripple their opponent.
Moreno also suffered a leg break in the 2014 World Cup when he played for the Mexican team against Van Gaal's Netherlands.
Cocu found it very difficult because he never intended to cripple his opponent, and he was not good after hearing that it was a very bad fracture, he said.
It was impossible to see that moment in my openness.
All I could see was a ball going in different directions. It's like Moreno touched him, but I didn't see Luke play.
Moreno said SBS 6: "I know what it feels like. I know how hard something like this can be.
I feel terrible about it, and I'm sorry.
Andrés from PSV was hospitalized after a fight against Chris Smalling in Guardado.
Of course, David Cameron knows The Lorax better than that?
It's something every parent learns in a short time: when your child loves a book, you know that it won't take much time to learn about it by heart.
It seems that if you're not David Cameron.
When asked by a holiday programmer supplier for childcare, what is her favorite children's book, Prime Minister The Lorax, Dr. He chose Seuss' 1971 environmental tale.
"I love reading this book, which is a funny, impressive, creative and powerful message, because it contains an image or message that we have always jumped in its content," Cameron wrote in a message published on SuperCamps' website.
Everything was going so well, until Cameron wrote something about the book's content, but actually summarized the 2012 film version of the book, where new characters and details were added to blow up the contents of the original fairy tale text.
In the city Thneed-Ville, where all nature is destroyed and even the weather is met, a child named Ted wants to realize his desire to see a real tree in order to win the heart of Audrey, the real name is Theodor Seuss Geisel, and Dr. Dr., who died in 1991. He's incorporating a story of love that Seuss doesn't know.
If this doesn't seem suspicious enough to you, in a way that Cameron handles, the text he handles shows a lot of similarity to the brief text of The Lora film in the Internet Film Archive, which begins: "In the city Thneed-Ville, the city, where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, wants to win the heart of Audrey, a girl in the dream of Ted."
Based on allegations that he is a competent parent, it is unlikely that Cameron knows the main thing about the book, where an anonymous young child hears how the local circle was destroyed by the stunt, moustache and "speaking on behalf of trees" creature, with a died, mustache and "speaking on the behalf of trees" creature, which gave the book its name to the book.
A very weak PR job, which is likely to be transferred to an officer of command, which is apparently the one who has not read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A lady from the presidential spokesperson said the text was thought to have come from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was obtained from Cameron's staff, but he did not comment otherwise.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of taking out England, but he's still intact
Playing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a challenge, but I don't think there's a repetition of the 3-0 Test series defeats after seeing the British team selected for the tour.
Still, I'm not extinuing a away win.
Alastair Cook's team may be more inexperienced than three years ago, but they have good spins on the line of strikes, and the collective game concept is also strong; these do not heal the wounds of 2012, only a little youth-induced optimism.
In the game with the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a game-turner, and Adil Rashid represents an attack option, even if the quality is unknown at the trial level.
Related: Adam Lyth is out of the UK Trial team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to remove Adam Lyth is a difficult decision for me to be analyzed as head coach in Yorkshire.
The Seven Trials were against two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the simple but inevitable fact is that cricketers are judged according to the outcome.
For example, there were no questions about Joe Root, there was an announcement to be made, because - as I said before - the players were their best choice.
After a few fifty-point series, Lyth could have seen his career prolonged, but he decided his own fate.
I hope you'll have another opportunity if he works harder for Yorkshire.
Trevor Bayliss, England's head coach, praised the player's attitude, although he didn't show his best performance, which did not surprise me; he is a team man above all.
It's hard to answer the question of how long it will take for a test hitter to take his grade.
Lyth - like Sam Robson before him - took seven caps, and on the other hand, Nick Compton took nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play a rematch.
The only pain you can feel may be the first England to go to the Caribbean for Jonathan Trott - Lyth's form is at the top - but this wasted opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and I think he's a high-level hitter.
He's an X-factor, and we saw it in Yorkshire when he scored 236 points against us on Trent Bridge at the beginning of this season.
It should be at least the same opportunity as before that, but of course it depends on the formation of a team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea that Moeen was able to get an extra game-turner while holding four quick speeds, and I'm not against it.
I don't understand why a hitter can't shoot here, and this left catcher has already shown how good he is as a cricketer.
Moeen might not have done his job for the city in Worcestershire, but he saw a number three for them, and it's not much different.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 attempt in his first fall before he started his debut in 2001.
He immediately got three hundred series and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup gamer and surprised me as an impressive young man in my limited discussions with him.
People can see their raw statistics - 31 averages in the stroke and 35 averages in the ball - and may think it's a degage, but there aren't a lot of game rotators that raise their hands, and the player choices are made in favor of the young one.
He's gonna learn a lot on this tour.
Away from the team, the UK seems to have made a few cunning additions to its own coaching team.
The commissioning of Sri Lankan hitter Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for the trial matches may be an ingenious measure.
One of the most adorable men of that game will bring with it a full experience that has been acquired in all circumstances and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball foot of the tour and gives both energy and a ruthless series to the game order.
I've always thought he was born for the international cricket world, whether he's a player or a coach, and he has an understanding that can be taken as a guide like Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the locker room, even if the messages previously said, can bring innovation to the team.
Colly's teammate Ben Stokes from Durham is being rested for one-day games, Root was given a similar break to Australia, and I have no problem with it.
Although not everyone agrees, plans are not made by coaches and players.
And you have to remember, like the players, their job depends on the results.
Decisions like this are never easily made.
Brexit can win if the economy is stagnant until 2017
David Cameron's semi-cooked renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting worse every day, and that's "Yes or no?" Despite Corbyn's election as Labor Party leader or the TUC infuriated on Europe on Tuesday.
Strangers have Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
Recently, a European diplomat said that some member states are tired of the agenda of fundamentally-sponsored treaty privileges and disruptive treaty changes in the EU, which are completely in crisis that are not entirely caused by them.
In his annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that he did not want them if it harmed social protection.
In fact, we can call it Dave and George's agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor attendees at the summits or bilateral meetings in the capitals of foreign countries, and take their own pictures, whether they are dignitaries or dignitaries in front of the famous monuments there, and then return to their country and gather allies for reform.
This is all about me.
"Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin said, "Don't leave us alone with France," my European friend, who wants an outward Britain in the EU tent, has come to a point where the more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals do not care if we are anymore.
Germany's cautious and sane luckale Angela Merkel has been in power for 10 years, with it, and Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), wants to leave power before the situation worsens.
François Hollande is faced with a change of power or a re-election in France in 2017.
He's a power that fades.
Soon, a nationalist government from the right side in Poland, and in Spain, a government from the left will come to power.
It is unlikely that these countries will make an effort for the Selfie British people who should use their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom because they do not want it either because most of them have separatist tendencies.
So some of the ministers like Scotland may be planning to speed up the Brexit process by making deliberate statements in the style of the Scottish National Party that will not help this during the United Kingdom's 2017 referendum campaign; that's what my friend says.
"The negotiation had never been a new outdate" and "British has achieved nothing that will benefit from the renegotiation."
Europeans, one of their previous experiences, know how much exploiting, oligarchical press barons were, how EU opponents were because they weren't like this in Tony Benn's time, but they inspired the 1975 referendum, which approved our entry in 1973 with a rate of 2-1.
This is how they remember Boris Johnson, the chief Euro-portanist, who was a reporter in Brussels in the early 90s, who made his name known as "EU flat bananas."
Aside from all the stupidity, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
Among them were anti-tax bums, illegal phone calls, and so-called foreign residency who had most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair often thought of the same things about them, with which he realized that when he was trapped in a cage with a horny gorilla, he realized that he had to distract him by giving him bananas so as not to be bait at lunch and after him at tea time.
In fact, the Miliband was also Blair's Blair to oppose Cameron's brilliant referendum idea, since Blair compromised the principle of the EU constitution, which was cancelled by French and Dutch voters who gave him the exit card.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But on Monday, he patted me friendlyly - telling me that he had no time to lose - Jeremy Corbyn seems to be in danger of Neil Kinnock's boycott strategy in the '80s, which was just a mistake.
Although it will take time, it needs to develop a coherent strategy to communicate with Andrew Marr, who left the BBC seat, especially with the media, not me.
I kindly express Corbyn's official position in Europe as a development.
He says he wants us to stay within an EU that's been reformed.
Most of the people who are out of Ukip's hostile tendencies and the fiery supporters of Conservative Little England say yes.
Anyway, that's what Hilary Benn, who's a Benn, but not a Bennite, said on radio and television this week, because naively forced Corbyn to accept that it was a bad idea to appoint John McDonnell as a shadowy Chancellor.
This reminds me of his father's struggle for disloyalty to his friends in the working cabinet in the '70s, his lack of loyalty, and his duty in the cabinet.
Hilary's struggle was more attractive.
But in Benn's statement - to fight to stay "in all circumstances," neither McDonnell said, nor what the JC said to the deputies at the special meeting held on Monday night.
Considering that he touched me, from the detail-but Gypsyn is trying to convey, regardless of the indiscretion image, the message discipline continues to be important in the social media vortex, which is in the age of 24/7 and especially in the social media vortex, which is a bed of paranoia and betrayal.
As McDonnell said, it is reasonable to impose difficulties with Europe, which allows Cameron to guarantee the Labour Party's support in the referendum.
Simon Jenkins certainly feels that way.
However, McDonnell and Corbyn's transition on EU membership in line with the Bennite siege economy and anti-capitalist pasts are no longer just a controversy between left-wing opponents, where small difference narcissism is one of the cornerstones of the doctrine gypsotics.
As with Nato's parade - Tom Watson is determined that JC will not campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will have to try to make sense of them for their masters in their country.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital for privileges to Britain, where they can all be forged, while they have skeptical voters?
As I was told at the opening of the British Impact Security Forum on Monday, the United States is already very disappointed by the British's poor minimum performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, despite the government of the ruling cost-reducing Conservative Party.
Experts criticize UK Public Health e-cigarette research
Researchers argued that e-cigarettes were 95% less harmful than smoking at a 12-member meeting, conducted by a government-funded agency, with those linked to the tobacco industry.
Experts in the British Journal of Medicine (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by the UK Public Health (PHE) in its e-cigarette report.
PHE published its report last month, which it described as "a thorough examination of the evidence".
However, some researchers questioned the robustness of data and drew attention to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month's editorial of the Lancet medical journal targeted the "extraordinary ground for caring" based on the main result of PHE.
Two other researchers at BMJ questioned the allegations "is it built on the roof or the rock."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that policies are based on the evidence of activity."
The public's allegations that PHE's "eight-cigarette is about 95% less harmful than smoking," they said, would be based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this nicotine-containing a 12-person meeting to develop a multi-criterate decision analysis (MCDA) model to create a synthesis of its views on the damages related to different products containing nicotine; the results of the meeting are summarized in a research article.
McKee and Capewell said that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which was reportedly receiving funds from British American Tobacco for an independent research.
He also said in a sustainability report that BAT approved the public health public health public disclosure document.
One of the 12 people at the meeting reportedly received funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but this was not the reported funding from the Philip Morris International cigarette company.
There was no information on how the members of the panel were selected, but among them were some known giants of the e-cigarette, where some of them reported the industrial fund in the article.
Some other people present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The tobacco chief at PHE attended the meeting.
McKee and Capewell wrote that the group's research article acknowledged "in an effective way" that "the lack of concrete evidence of the harms of most products according to many criteria."
But none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
MCKee and Capewell said that "there are no evidence of a transition to smoking for children or non-smokers".
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said the allegations at BMJ have already been answered.
He said, "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two people with a smoker for life dies from this addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks caused by e-cigarettes are small compared to, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear task: to inform the public about what the evidence shows and does not show at a time when there is a lot of confusion about its damages, especially compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die from a smoking-related disease a year, and smoking costs the NHS by $2 billion a year.
We carry out our national responsibility by making it clear that the e-cigarette is only a small portion of the damage caused by smoking, although the e-cigarette is not risk-free.
The previous Channel 4 chief said the BBC should leave EastEnders
The previous Channel 4 president, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and that advertising competitors could "produce their right-hand arms" for hit programs such as Albert Square series.
Johnson said the licensing fee should only be used to make programs of the type that was not made by other British publishers.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programs on BBC4, which may be viewed by a smaller audience, against their competitors' most rating-taking programs in valuable ranges.
After the agency wanted to co-operate more with other organisations, Johnson said that it had failed for six years in its time on Channel 4 to form a connection with the BBC.
"I am struggling with the idea that BBC is clearly ordering and publishing programs that can be shown by non-residential competitors," Johnson told the House of Lords communications committee during an interrogation of the BBC's future.
If you continue the licensing fee application, which I am not sure is a good idea in the medium or long term, the output must be reduced to programs that others do or do not order.
He's broadcasting The Voice in the primetime range because they want to provide as much support as I can for the future.
The idea here is based on the notion that no one else will publish, which is ridiculous and clear nonsense.
"I don't understand why programmes that can be funded without help should be funded by a declining tax.
The Voice is one of which is EastEnders, and it's actually internally.
To be honest, other channels give their right arms for it.
I'm trying to see how public service broadcasts are.
I don't think that's going to diminish the BBC at all.
Johnson, a series of entrepreneurs who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of pursuing ratings because "thereth of the people working here and the best way to guarantee long-term support."
Commenting on BBC's most popular programmes repeats comments by previous Sky administrator Tony Ball, who used MacTaggart in Edinburgh in 2003 to offer the BBC to sell programs such as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's more appropriate public service programmes went to the BBC4, and that viewer measurements can not be done here, but they meet tax pardons, and that they can discuss to continue their demonstration religious missions on providing the basis for 4 billion pounds in licensing income, he added: "We are doing all these blackout programs that no one has ever seen."
They put these in the gaps that no one will ever watch.
Regarding the license fee, Johnson told the committee: "I invite you to find a more regressive system for those who benefit the best.
Of course, you're all thinking, we're all thinking, 150 pounds a year is a big value, but I'm wondering if they're doing it for people who do 150 pounds to do it because they don't watch a lot of BBCs.
At the same time, David Elstein, former director of Sky and Channel 5, who presented evidence to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise the Reithian mission to "information, educate and entertain".
He said that some of the BBC's exit was now officially classified as education - this was 1% of the TV output and 0.1% of the radio - and that public service broadcasts in Australia and Canada should lead to this, which should be changed to "information, lighting and training."
With regard to partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should only collaborate with advertisers to do something on TV but about Proms that are shown as a handful, and to ensure that all of them are watched online.
'tragematic' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the thread wolves change direction as soon as they are hit by their sound vibrations.
Scientists have raised maggots with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by sound wave bursts.
When tiny thread wolves are hit by sound vibrations in the high-pitched that people can't hear, they change direction.
The vibrations are activated by activated genetically modified motor nerve cells to carry dice channels that respond to trans-sound waves.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers say maggots prove the strength of a new procedure called Sonogenetic, so ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brains, hearts and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani Guardian, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told Guardian that one day this procedure could replace deep-brain stimulation, an intrusive procedure that gives electrical vibrations into people's brains to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Threadworms often do not react beyond sound, but found that they reacted when they were surrounded by a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles he finds strengthen the trans-voice waves, allowing them to pass through the maggots.
Reinforced cross-sound waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels, which are found in the membranes of some maggot cells.
According to a report published in Nature Communications, sound waves allow these ion channels to open and activate the cells they are connected to.
In order to create threadworms controlled by beyond voice, Chalasani genetically altered maggots to allow some motor neurons to carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applied beyond the sound of the altered creatures, the sound waves were reinforced by micro-catters and transmitted into the maggots, and they started the engine neurons that were changed here.
This procedure has similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to operate and turn neurons with light vibrations.
But Chalasani says sonogenetics may have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike the light that needs to be sent to the desired point in the brain through an optical fiber, low-frequency trans-sound waves can pass through the tissue without barriers and thus can be sent into the brain through the skull.
"We believe that human neurons targeted in clinical environment for specific neurological treatments can be temporarily sensitive to trans-voice signals by usinggen therapy and a therapeutic virus," Chalasani said.
He added that other applications can be concentrated on muscle cells and insulin-productive cells.
Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements condemn the UK's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's anti-weapons show video.
Terrible killer drones!
The shackles that smash your ankle!
Part-effect bombs!
And electric shocked batons that cause severe pain but leave no traces!
Thin sound and cartoon images, designed for Amnesty International to emphasize the British government's desire to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the International for Defence and Security Equipment at the ExCel Centre in London Dock, leaves no doubt that the world's largest weapons fair is a sharp scam.

However, a different campaign continues with posters on bus stops and subway trains, and it requires to look twice.
"Is the important announcement that will travel at DLR between 15-18 September?" says, "Is the important announcement to travel at DLR between 15-18 September by using London's fonts and brand.
This September, a herd of arms dealers will attack the DLR... Customers are asked to help stop this gun fair.
300 posters are one of the artists who exhibited at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Bansky's Dismathes.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute the "Pulse Packs to the Advertisement Area" using the "Pulse Packs" of the "Bus stop on the planet, which has accessed about a third of the bus stop advertising areas in the planet."
Transportation for London is not satisfied with this banner "vandalism."
One of the ads was created by the Special Patrol group collective.
According to the cruel designers curator and Professor of Essex University, artists are becoming more questioning every day and looking for ways to move political affairs to masses outside the galleries.
Many artists act with activists in protest movements, and they begin to realize that their arts need to come out to the real world to have an impact on society.
Another anti-weapons poster stands in front of subway travellers.
Amnesty International's video was viewed over 100,000 on Facebook within 24 hours, and was created by the VCCP advertising agency, which worked for free, and the graphic designer and the voice artist prepared it for free.
Matt Lever, the creator director of the VCCP, was shocked by the silence of gun fairs ads - with the free space in the ExCel calendar - and thought: "Let's offer them a campaign they are trying to escape."
They played with the idea of making a more realistic, cunning corporate ad, but "They decorated it with bright colors and animation, made it more remarkable."
"They have helped us a lot to create concerns about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair," said Amnesty Tom Davies.
What we need now is that the British government will act and prevent the torture equipment from being illegally sold outside our door.
Maybe the most creative art at the arms fair comes from the inside ExCeL, where the exhibitors sell fantastic-covered products.
In a press release, Saab showed the US military's "att4CS RS launched from our shoulders."
This includes "uniquely shaped and hits the target with a big blow" by passing the armor.
Whatever he's doing, it's not gonna be nice.
Eight golden rules of living in student dormitories
It's been 11 years since I moved to student dormitories as an unrelated 19-year-old, and I still believe in berets and moral relativity, but now I remember the phony smiles of what I'm bothering - and their numerous-length complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled in eight golden rules.
Moving into the dormitory can go from frustrating to complete terrifyingity.
The seduction of babbling: where he is from people, where he loses the year, where he insists on Corbyn, and why "don't love or hate Marmite, because he really, gentlemen, he's only yeast extract, I'm gonna be in my room."
Take a breath.
And let the others get one - ask questions and show interest.
It will guide this conversation and help you separate what you like from people you won't talk about, even if your eyelashes are on fire and they're spraying fire extinguishers.
Leave some room for the people.
People's rooms often turn into receptions of drinks, movie nights, and mass hangouts, but these are also places where people dress and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting university with a relationship
They're introverted, they're treated badly in college.
Your room may be a place of retreat, but many dormitory corridors develop an inter-room-in-room-in-competual culture and this friendly, social and lifelong friendship.
This could be hell for someone who's trying to store energy.
Nothing in culture will let you say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go for a while so I can put the energy I've spent when I contact you."
Try to sense that a friend is tired of socializing and perhaps texting instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A friend in a dorm had a policy as invited inside if the door was not locked.
He's seen a lot of things.
Make friends through cooking.
Since you started college at the peaks of the cooking competition frenzy, it is less strange to introduce yourself by knocking on people's doors with a plate of brownies, and less 1950s will be "welcome to our neighborhood, I baked you something, now you smile while you ask personal questions."
It's a great way to make friends to offer people homemade treats.
Maybe your roommates will feel compelled to talk and associate your face with a sweet surprise.
Frankly, this is about you being a master cook.
A lump of lumps, sugar and oil, which will cause people to pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Stealing food is a crime that is a common crime in student dormitories.
To be honest, toy someone's chicken is theft, but steal a few drops of milk for your tea?
Check the milk owner twice.
He'll probably tell you to take care of yourself, even if he's swimming in it.
It's very uncomfortable that someone steals their belongings, and I understand you -- but try to cope with it more mature than my roommate. He put liquid soap in to punish the one who stole his milk.
He's in jail now.
Do not make noises to prevent people from sleeping or studying.
It's not just being a decent person, but because you're the people in the glass houses.
A girl in my hallway presses her next door and tell her to turn the drums a little bit because it's 3:00 a.m. and she's got a morning test.
Their answer was to turn the sound louder.
When they finally closed at 5:00 a.m., she kindly allowed them to sleep for two hours before they went to her own three-hour test by opening her last sound and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be very romantic for your future wife to move to the same corridor as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be weird that you misunderstood a corridor friend and think you're your future wife, you have to hang out, leave and see her every day, and have to watch your mutual friends take captivity?
Of course, that's the heart, but if your hot corridor neighbor is definitely not your future partner, at least talk to the little one and recommend common sense.
When you realize that someone left their keys inside without locking their door in your cheerful moment, know that the line between the joke and persecution of someone is thinner than you think.
A good joke is fun, but it will take time to come back.
You can give someone a valuable and fun lesson in safety by hiding their things - but never pollute someone's room with shampoo and toothpaste.
Lock your doors and put your keys in a glass of water in a glass of water, but stick your belongings to the ceiling more than twice.
Chairman of parliament of immigration origin to the Netherlands
Arib, who received the highest number of votes in the fourth round of the elections held yesterday in parliament, became the first president of the Dutch-based assembly.
Arib, who also holds Moroccan citizenship, will take on this role until 2017.
Arib was also a candidate for president in 2012, where he served as a member of parliament since 1998, but was not elected.
Surprise suit for Hope Cloud!
Umut Bulut, who did not reconcile with G.SARAY fans and suffered a morale due to the protests of the tribunes in the last matches, came from Eskişehirspor.
He missed this position, he wanted out of the game!
During Ryan Donk's transfer, Eskişehirspor made the last step for the national scoring player he wanted to add to Kasımpaşa's squad.
However, the red blacks were responded negatively by the G.Saray administration.
His heart stopped when he was getting better
RIO DA Raquel Santos (28), the mother of two children living in JANEIRO, applied to the aesthetic doctor last Monday to remove traces caused by laughing at the edge of the mouth.
The woman who was injected with a filling material in her face accelerated her heart rate and breathing after a while.
Afterwards, he died when his heart stopped.
Police are investigating whether the woman played a role in the death of a drug called "Potenay," which she uses on a daily basis.
The real cause of death will be determined after the autopsy.
Debora Azevedo, one of the best friends of the model, told the Brazilian press that Santos, one of whom is 7 and 13 years old, is obsessed with aesthetic surgery.
Santos, who joined one of Brazil's most important beauty contests, Musa do Brasil, came in second last December.
Oil companies officially collapsed
From 2014, when oil prices began to drop, about $400 billion was postponed by the end of last year, while the most deep-sea (deepwater) oil exploration projects were suspended.
According to a research conducted by consulting company Wood Mackenzie, low oil prices, oil and gas exploration/production led to the suspension of $380 billion in project, while millions of barrels production has been postponed from the Gulf of Mexico to Africa in a wide geography.
"Company budgets have narrowed dramatically," the report shows the lowest level of 12 years, decreasing 70 per cent in 1.5 years, while the biggest cost of cost cuts in the summer of 2014 was 115 dollars.
400 BILLION DOLLAR HANGER
Crude oil prices are making new surprises every day, and finally saw the lowest level of the past 12 years, dropping below $30.
"Does oil fall to $15"; "Is oil now cheaper than water" debates are inflamed, the research published by energy consulting company Wood Mackenzie reveals how the sector is affected by falling prices.
Lastly, Wood Mackenzie, who released in July, found that falling oil prices led to the suspension of 46 large energy investments of $200 billion, revealing in his new research, where this figure reached by the end of 2015.
Accordingly, in the last six months of 2015, 22 larger projects have been postponed, while 68 major projects have been suspended since the collapse of oil began in 2014.
The value of these projects is about 400 billion dollars.
DAILY 2.9 MILLION
The study stressed that the impact of low oil prices on company plans is "ruthless", noting that the most affected projects are deep-sea development projects.
The suspended projects correspond to a total of 27 billion barrels of crude oil equivalent to the reserve, while 2.9 million barrels of oil production per day are delayed by 2025.
According to the study, most of the projects in question were postponed to 2017 and later, while their first production targets were recorded between 2020 and 2023.
"The majority of $170 billion is deep-sea projects," the report stressed, stressing that 68 projects are projected to be made in the next 5 years, with potential investments of $170 billion.
And that's because the cost of pre-investment is too high.
"70 per cent of deep sea expenditure is primarily comprised of oil-based projects in Nigeria, Angola and the US's Gulf of Mexico," it is said.
According to the study, the countries with the most postponed oil project inventory are Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway and the United States.
These six countries have almost 90 per cent of the delayed liquid (petroleum) reserves.
Mozambique, Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia, the countries with the largest amount of delayed gas reserves, account for 85 per cent together.
While most of the natural gas waiting to come out here is located in the deep sea, it requires complex and expensive development solutions such as establishing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant from the ground.
Companies that are most endangered are oil giants with successive commitments in deep sea, Canadian oil sand and Caspian Region, while companies are also trying to adapt to the "longest" oil prices scenario.
EYES IN IRAN
Not long ago, there was a picture of what was like four years ago: the United States and Europe embargoed on Iranian oil to stop Tehran's nuclear program, the barrel price of oil was about $110, and it was discussing how to cut Iranian oil exports without causing a sudden leap in prices.
And when we get back to this week, we see a whole different scenario.
Oil prices have seen below $30 for the first time since 2004, which is mainly due to the US production boom, and embargoes lifted.
That's why the eyes are on Iran.
If Iran increases oil exports, even more oil will flow into the oil market, which is already said to be quite saturated.
This can lead to the lower levels of prices that surprise us today.
Some analysts, Saudi Arabia, who does not want to lose market share to Iran, will pump even more oil and Iran - S. He says there may be a price war between Arabia.
As soon as sanctions lifted, Iran's main goal is Asia's rapidly growing oil market India and its former partners in Europe.
In their earlier statements, Iranian officials said they aimed to increase exports by 500,000 barrels per day in the first place and to launch another amount after a while.
According to Reuters' map information, 22 large crude oil carriers (VLCC) are waiting for 22 large crude oil carriers (VLCC) off Iran, while at least 13 of them are full or in large quantities.
Iran is the country with the fourth largest proven oil reserves in the world.
Thanks to sanction exceptions, Iran is currently exporting about 1 million barrels of crude oil to some countries, including Turkey.
Before the sanctions, Iran's daily oil exports were up to 3 million barrels per day.
Aysun Göksu, Expert for Support Securities Research, answers the question of whether oil will fall below $20: "Chinese-based global growth concerns increase downward pressure on commodity prices, resulting in deepening losses in oil prices."
In China, the world's largest oil importer, in parallel with the economic slowdown, we see that oil has reached 20 per cent since New Year's Eve, with concerns that oil demand will decrease.
In addition, with the global value of the dollar and the global surplus problem, we can witness prices in oil under $30 in the coming days.
As long as we do not see permanent pricing over 32-33 dollar levels, the rise movement in oil may be limited and downward pressure may increase.
At this point, it can be said that closings below the critical 30 dollar level have a key role in order for the declines to continue.
In such a case, it should not be a surprise to see loosenings on the bottom until the support zone of 23.30-25.60.
Isham Sardouk: 'The millennium is over!'
Why did you take the course of trend creativity in Victoria's Secret and WGSN, which determines the fashion trends of the world, and why did you take the route to Turkey?
- I'm always in favor of a change.
I was born in Paris, lived in London, then went to New York.
I took important positions there, too.
Meanwhile, I've been consulting Koton for the last two years.
And then I saw the potential in this geography and the Koton brand.
I realized that there was everything necessary to be a chain of stores in the world.
I'm here to make this happen.
Will you be able to make it in a short time?
- I'm sure it is.
Although it is already a young brand, it is already sold in 50 countries.
We make 50 collections a year, 15 separate sections.
So a chain of stores has everything it needs to have.
From Dubai to Moscow, we can respond to the needs of consumers in different geographies.
Now we're opening a store in Paris in March, which is the beginning of a new and exciting era...
Is it necessary to open a store in Paris?
- I'm sorry. - Yeah, yeah.
It's not because Europe's economic situation is fantastic.
But you open some stores for image.
You have a shop in fashion capitals like Paris, London, you make money from the Middle East.
One adds prestige to the brand, the other adds money, both are necessary for a brand that plays for globality.
So let's talk about trends...
- We've got a very romantic, elegant season ahead of us.
Flying chiffon dresses, soft shades, pinks, whites, reds.
Patterns...
We are going through very difficult and ruthless times, and the fashion world always tries to add a little happiness to life by carrying stylish, heartwarming designs to the podium during these difficult times.
That's what we do.
That's why the "superception age" comes back in the new season.
Let's go back to your years at Victoria's Secret.
Who was the most legendary angel? -Karolina Kurkova.
I'm not just talking about your wonderful physique: she's so positive, she's so good.
He'd sit next to me while I was working, and he'd feed me with apples and stuff, "Did you love me, hungry?"
So he was so cute.
You know, I've looked into what I'm talking about, and you've interviewed all Victoria's Secret models.
Isn't Karolina so beautiful?
But Adriana Lima was very impressed with her beauty.
- Say yes, that voice!
That speech, that tone...
After a while, you're nervous, you're like, "Take a stand and look beautiful, don't do anything else!"
It brings nerve.
That's right, there's such shocks.
I interviewed Candice Swanepoel.
She was the most beautiful girl I've ever seen, but I was terrified of her idleness.
- Most of them are like that.
New angels aren't the same...
I remember Gisele's time.
It was hard working with him, though.
He came backstage, smoked like a chimney.
Not because he's Tiryaki.
No one can drink, he's the only one who can drink!
Let's be the purpose of being a "diva."
The Victoria's Secret show, released two months ago, received the lowest rating in its history.
Why do you think?
- Like I said, it's over, that time of the beautiful legendary angels.
I'm sorry, but who should do Gigi Hadid?
What's so beautiful about it?
Kendall Jenner, like a board...
No curves, nothing.
Kate Moss' curves are zero, but it's become the biggest name in the fashion industry.
- Yeah, but how nice he had a nice face.
I'd like to exercise my right to object here.
I did an interview last year, his face collapsed a lot...
- All this cigarettes, booze, now it's ugly.
But in the '90s, he had such a pretty face.
His lips were like Brigitte Bardot.
He was at the end of the supermodel era.
To the time of Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington...
Christy was next door, and I saw it without makeup every morning.
Such a pure beauty, such grace can't be elegance.
And Cara Delevingne?
- He's wasting himself.
Not every campaign is included.
People are getting tired.
There's no hunger for famous models, celebrities as it used to be.
People want to see real faces like themselves in campaigns.
And we're gonna go through with it.
Because it's trending.
Turkey letter from 25 authors
According to BBC Turkish, the International Writers Association (PEN) has become a common part of life by the International Writers Association (PEN) in England, Wales and Scotland, and the threats targeting their colleagues, journalists and publishers in Turkey.
The letter quoted two attacks targeting the Turkish daily Hurriyet, the raid of the Koza group and the arrests of Vice News correspondents, and the investigations and arrests against journalists were also among the alarming developments.
The mother's half-time right was controversial
"We think that mothers are given the right to work half in order to be reintroduced."
"This could be a trojan horse," he said, "We are worried that this arrangement that will be in favor of women will prevent women from working."
The new rights, which are planned to be brought after childbirth or adoption to the workers and working women, have passed the commission with all-day negotiations.
The most common issue in the commission negotiations of the regulations that enabled 6 months of part-time work or free leave after child primary school age and the most common issue in the commission negotiations was "rent workmanship."
CHP İzmir Deputy Musa Çam, who stated that it is right to have partial work done until the child goes to primary school, but they have some concerns, said, "If you bring the lease work arrangement after this, we will be in front of you until the end."
Enis Bağdadioğlu, who participated in the Commission's talks on behalf of Turkish-Business, expressed similar concerns and said, "We have doubts about how to replace the female employee in the semi-time work."
Bagdadioğlu stated that if the worker for hire comes up again on this occasion, new problems will occur that will exceed the subcontractor work will be doubled and said, "This is why we will watch the developments related to private employment offices with concern."
"There is no such long-term partial work in other countries," said TISK Secretary General Bülent Pirler, while stating that partial work was brought by the law for 5 years.
Look at it this way.
"In places with 1 or 2 employees, it is necessary to consider the consequences of this application," he said.
TOBB Counsellor Ahmet Şağar said that there will be trouble in finding workers in case of life of practice.
Stating that there is no legislation on the rules to be applied in part-time work, Şağar said, "Reconciliation between the employee and the employer should be reached to the arrangements regarding the private employment institutions."
Metin Feyzioğlu: We do not support
"We do not agree with this statement, we cannot participate and support it," Feyzioglu said.
Because there's no concise criticism of the PKK.
You couldn't say anything negative to the PKK, a separatist terrorist organization, you didn't dust it.
We do not find and sincere to take into account the heavy expressions made only to the state, taking into account those who make them.
We're lawyers, we're lawyers.
If the state representatives, public officials, security forces have an unlawful behavior within this framework, let us follow it.
When we say, "Don't destroy the state," they attack us as "diparagraph, fascist" when we say to the remnants of the separatist or the separatists, and the remnants of the romance, which look at the separatists or the dividers.
"This state must act in accordance with the law, it must always keep the law superior," they say, "You are separatist."
We're bridges.
We're always people who are obligated to tell the truth.
Bombing on armored vehicle in Van
The incident occurred around 20.45 in the evening near the Akköprü Primary and Second School in Akköprü Neighborhood of the central Keyba District.

Who is Bergen?
Bergen, whose real name is Belgin Sarıldıer, was born on 16 July 1960 in Mersin.
With the divorce of his parents, he moved to Ankara in 1966 with his mother Sebahat Çakır.
After Yenimahalle Yunus Emre Primary School, he entered the Piano section of Ankara State Conservatory, but he left due to financial difficulties and worked at PTT for a while.
In 1979, he went to the Feyman Night Club to perform with his friends and accepted the offer he had received for his work.
Together with the Group Locomotive orchestra at Feyman Night Club, he performed with Turkish Art Music, Turkish Light Music and repertoires of the period.
Bergen, who went to Adana for work after Ankara, met Halis Serbes and got married a year later.
In 1982, he released his first longplay from Atlas Records, "I Have Complaint."
Bergen, unable to withstand her husband's violence as her debut in art life continued, fled her husband many times.
In October 1982, while working in Izmir, she was struck in the face with her husband's instigation.
Bergen, who lost one eye in this attack and burned most of the body, said "Who knows?" the composer of the song was persuaded by Cengiz Özşeker and released on stage.
The artist, who performed at İzmir Diamond Pavyon, owned by Özşeker until 1985, prepared a demo tape called "Brother Destiny" with his boss and sent it to Yaşar Kekeva.
Kekeva, who liked Bergen, invited the artist to Istanbul.
The artist, who produced the first professional longplay in the Istanbul music market, "Human Severse," under the direction of Burhan Bayar, became famous with his "Women of Pain" towards the end of 1986.
In April 1987, he was awarded the title of "The Album of 1986 Best Selling Arabesk Kadın Artist" by the record label with the title of Golden Record and the Gold Cassette.
In the same year, he appeared on camera with Yalçın Gülhan, Asuman Arsan and Meral Niron in the film "Women of Pain" with Ülkü Erakalın's screenplay and director.
Bergen, who gained a huge fan base, survived the knife attack in Adana where he went for the concert at the last moment.
The artist, who left the stage for a while, released the albums "Her de Yak God", "The Cost of My Love" and "Is Not" respectively, in the directors of the great masters Selami Şahin, Özer Şenay and Cengiz Tekin.
In April 1989, Bergen officially divorced her husband, returning to the stages in June 1989 with her last album "Years Don't Affetmez."
The artist, who started the promotional tours of the album, which was received with great interest, was shot and killed by his wife in Adana Pozanti on the night of August 14, 1989, to August 15.
His hometown was buried in Mersin.
Bergen also incorporated a video film with 5 longplays and 11 songs in 11 short lives for 29 years.
The allegations that the artist, who signed the arabeske with his different and strong voice, became true with the end of the first day of the album "Giden Gençliğim," which was released after his death.
Bergen's officially released studio albums:
1982 - I have Complaint LP (reprinted as MC in 1986).

Nazim Hikmet commemorated on his 114th birthday
Nazım Hikmet Ran, known as the Poet of Hometown, was commemorated with the "Happy Birthday Nazim" event in the 114th year of his birth.
The event, organized by Konak Municipality, took place in the hall where the poet's name was given in Güzelyalı Cultural Center.
The poems of the famous poet were performed by the theatre and cinema actor Rüştü Asya, performing poetry and music concerts with the event.
In addition, Asians were accompanied by three Anatolian Musical Bands with comments.
Nazım Hikmet accompanied many art lovers.
These names included Ali Seçkiner Buyer, Erkoç Torun, Nedim Yıldız and Zeynep Göknur Yıldız and Ziya Özsökmenler.
In Istanbul, the event was organized by the Nazım Hikmet Foundation for Culture and Arts.
The President of the Foundation, Rutkay Aziz and the members of Nâzım Hikmet's wife Vera Tulyakova's daughter, son-in-law and grandson, actress Tarık Akan met in Tarabya for the event.
"Living is like a tree, one and free / And like a forest, like a forest," he reads poems and leaves carnations to the sea.
Organized with the contributions of Sarıyer Municipality, the event will be accompanied by Nâzım Hikmet Koro songs.
Nazım Hikmet was born on January 15, 1902.
The poems of the world-famous poet Nazım Hikmet were translated into more than 50 languages.
He was arrested repeatedly for his political opinion and spent most of his adult life in prison or exiled.
His poems have been translated into more than fifty languages and his works have been awarded many awards.
He died on 3 June 1963.
Bursa Nilüfer Municipality conducted special works on the 114th birthday of the world-famous poet Nazım Hikmet.
The municipality, which works for the documentary "Bursa's Nazim," which describes Nazım's 11-year-old days in Bursa Prison, also issued a personal stamp for the poet for the first time in the history of Turkey.
In this way, in cooperation with PTT, the first personal stamp was issued in the history of Turkey on behalf of Nazım Hikmet.
This special stamp with a price of 1.40 TL and the first day envelopes will be presented to the guests on the night to be held at Nazım Hikmet Cultural House on Thursday, January 14.
They will be deported by bicycle
However, since no agreement has been reached between the two countries, refugees, most of whom are Syrians, will have to pedal at minus 20 degrees and return to Russia.
In the summer, a group of refugees flew to Russia and crossed north of the country from Murmansk to Norway on the grounds that it was safer and cheaper.
Since the agreement between the two countries did not allow the crossing of the border on foot, the immigrants crossed the border by bicycle.
Norway has now decided to send these refugees back.
For this reason, the Norwegian police ordered the repair of the abandoned bicycles when they crossed the border.
"3 billion euros for Turkey" crisis in the EU
The crisis continues with Turkey over the 3 billion euros promised for refugees.
European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker criticised Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's blocking of the funds to be transferred to Turkey.
The mood between Italy and the rest of Europe is not good, Juncker said, stressing that the EU has to find 3 billion euros.
"This money is not for Turkey, but for Syrian refugees in Turkey."
We haven't reached 3 billion yet.
"This is a matter of the credibility of the EU, which is therefore important," he said.
Juncker said he expects the money to be completed by January 26th, the date given earlier.
Italy is one of the countries that draws attention with its positive attitude when it comes to Turkey.
Rome's stance on the fiscal package is not directly a move towards Turkey, and is linked to the problems between Italy and the EU Commission and some union countries.
There has been tension between Italy and the EU for some time.
Renzi continued to harshly criticise German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the EU at the last EU summit on energy, banking and migrants.
"Renzi must stop accusing the EU," Juncker criticised Renzi's stance at yesterday's press conference.
"Renzi, which I love him very much, it is wrong for him to insult the EU Commission at every opportunity," he said.
Juncker implied that Renzi was playing for the internal public.
Of the 3 billion euros promised to Turkey, 1 billion will be covered by the EU budget.
2 billion euros will be due to the budgets of the member states.
Germany will contribute at least 427m euros.
For political reasons, the Greek Administration has decided to transfer funds to the EU budget for support for support of Jordan and Lebanon, which has a share of 2.3m euros.
The source is expected to be used in the period 2016-2017.
I cried when I saw the Chalie Hebdo cartoon
Speaking to Russian official news agency Sputnik, the father Abdullah Kurdi reacted harshly and said, "I cried for this cartoon if you want it to be true."
"I felt so bad," he said.
Saying that they expect positive things from the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, which became a symbol of freedom of expression after the shooting, Kurdi said:
Unfortunately, they made a bad cartoon.
Everyone's upset with this cartoon.
Aylan is a 2-year-old boy and he died.
Charlie Hebdo was supposed to respect Aylan, me, and my family, but the other way around.
This magazine should respect the people who died.
They've published a disrespectful cartoon about our master.
And they have spread out on Allah.
It's a small thing that was done to my child against God and the Prophet.
Kurdi, who lives in Erbil, called: "I call the whole world and humor magazine, everyone should respect all the children who have died."
He must not upset their families, he must not cause pain in their suffering.
Aylan Kurdi's aunt, Tima Kurdi, who lives in Canada, was also one of those who reacted to the cartoon.
Laurent 'Riss' Sourisseau, in the signed cartoon, three-year-old Syrian Aylan Kurdi, who hits the lifeless body on the beach of Bodrum, has the impression that he may be one of the harassers in Germany.
Last year, Hz. The French humor magazine Charlie Hebdo, who was attacked by radical religiousists on the grounds that he published the cartoons of Muhammad, was again the focus of the debate over Aylan Kurdi.
The cartoon depicts harassers in Cologne, Germany, especially in the city of Cologne, who were chased by women's abuses during the New Year's Eve celebrations, as were monks with pigskin and evoking immigrants.
The cartoon, which causes different reactions on social media, is actually part of a 4-frame column.
The colon says "That's not France" and, according to many readings, criticises the growing hostility of refugees, along with other values lost in France.
The cartoon, on the other hand, has caused many people to accuse Charlie Hebdo of racist.
In a single issue published last year, Charlie Hebdo praised Germany, which agreed to receive 800,000 refugees, and criticised France's reluctance to open its doors to migrants.
The cartoon said, "He was very close to his goal," while the ad poster said "Two children's menus for one price."
'The autopsy for the Germans who died in Sultanahmet is in Germany'
According to a report on the website of the weekly Der Spiegel magazine, the German Federal Prosecutor's Office has decided to bring the body of 10 people killed in the attack to Germany.
The bodies of the deceased will be greeted by a German Air Force plane today or tomorrow at the country and at the airport.
In Germany, experts from the Identification Commission under the Federal Criminal Agency (BKA) conduct forensics, go to the countries where the incident occurred for German citizens who died in accidents or attacks under normal circumstances, and there are identification and autopsy.
Der Spiegel magazine, however, wrote that this time the situation would be different.
Officials from the Federal Criminal Agency, according to the journal, appealed to Turkish authorities for identification of the deceased and autopsy in Istanbul, but Turkish officials refused to accept the proposal.
The Federal Criminal Agency sent four experts to Istanbul after the Istanbul attack.
Seven German tourists injured in the attack are being treated in the hospital.
Ellen Meiksins Wood lost her life
Meiksins Wood, a well-known political theorist and socialist historian, was particularly prominent with his important work on the origins of capitalism.
Meiksins Wood of Latvian origin, born in New York in 1942, also published in Turkish, is as follows: Escape from Classroom -- Archaic Culture of Capitalism -- Capitalism Against Democracy -- Origin of Capitalism -- Capital Empire -- Return to Marx
Refusal for swimming pool for asylum-seeker men
The German press reported that the municipality would lift the ban if it is notified that the message of the ban by social workers in the dormitory was understood by asylum seekers.
In a statement to WDR, social department official Markus Schnapka, who noted that the municipality did not want to punish the innocents for the behavior of several people, said they had informed the residents of the dormitories in three languages about the values of importance in Germany.
Schnapka noted that they debated the gender equality value that Germany cares about, adding that the municipality will punish all kinds of attacks and harassment.
On the other hand, the carnival parade in Rheinberg was cancelled due to the possibility of harassment scandals in Cologne at the upcoming carnival passages.
The city has announced that the carnival pass has been canceled because there is no guarantee that the harassment will not happen.
What are the benefits of steaming?
The steam-drinking technique, a technique that does not kill vitamins and minerals in the nutrients, is becoming increasingly popular.
Steaming, one of the most preferred cooking techniques in the Far East for centuries, makes metabolism strong and facilitates digestion.
With this method, which completely eliminates problems such as indigestion, the bacteria and microbes contained in the nutrients are also completely dying.
The substances in the food, such as protein, cellulose and starch, melt completely with this technique, which makes the food softer.
Steaming at low pressure is carried out in the pot with the help of steam containers or steam machine.
In high pressure, the amount of water used and cooking time is small.
The best example of this can be shown to cook in the pressure cooker.
Especially in order to cook foods such as vegetables in the diet menus, it is necessary to wash the vegetables thoroughly and then put them in the filter and wait for them to glide thoroughly.
A deep pot is filled with water at a third of it and the steam strainer is placed in the pot.
The mouth of the pot is left with a semi-closed mouth.
In this way, it is ensured that the steam is easily out of the pot.
The stove fever is first brought to the highest level and the water is boiled, then a constant heat is achieved by bringing the stove temperature to a lower level.
Vegetables and nutrients cooked for about 10 - 15 minutes in the steam are checked with the help of a fork after thoroughly cooked.
The cooked vegetables are taken from the stove and placed on the plates and served.
The appearance, color and smell of food in steaming technique do not change, so this method is healthy.
The food tastes the same.
Thus, the quality and taste of the food is intact.
In steaming, which is also one of the most economical cooking methods, food loss is kept at the minimum level.
The steamed vegetables offer a satisfactory feast to the eater with their more vivid and vivid appearance.
This method, which is used frequently especially in dietary foods, is also preferred as it is light.
David Bowie - Blackstar: Alien's album "last"
To know that you will die; to make that last album without telling anyone, to make the death bed an artistic expression in the music video you shot...
Such works may seem too "end" for us Earthling fans.
I'm saying Earthlings because I'm among those who believe that the man who did this is both immortal and alien.
He came to our world from another corner of the universe, and now he's back to his homeland, and that's what happened.
It came because there was an inspiration that should be given not only to Kiss, Marilyn Manson, or Lady Gaga, but to all world artists.
He's done his duty properly.
David Bowie, Blackstar, iTunes price: 9.99 TL 5/5
He probably fed from Warhol, Kubrick, which is from the same planet as him.
When Apollo 11 landed on the Moon, he decided to say, "Is this something, am I an alien?" And he got mixed up singing "Space Oddity."
He didn't get involved; he always went a few steps ahead.
Many have found the paths he lost because of him.
Both musician and listener...
If we take the interest in plastic arts, his acting, it's not fair to say "it was just music" for his music.
The characters he created from the song to the song, his references, innovation, tadeletism and discography refers to me an artistic integrity.
I can't call himself an ancestor of glam rock, nor punk's cousin...
If I call it that way, what about those avant-garde electronic movements, the jazz he's kept in as love since he was a kid?
Until these years when we were chewing on our mouths, David Bowie kept reminding us what the word meant.
It wasn't a man, it wasn't a woman; it wasn't "human."
It was a body.
He showed up to us for a while because of a mission.
He left this world two days after his 26th studio album, "Blackstar."
Before the album was released, he tried to get used to us that he was going with "Blackstar" and "Lazarus."
We thought, "He's old, he's talking about death and everything." He knew everything.
One more game...
Apart from the great "Blackstar" and "Lazarus," which bear the message and the burden of emotion of the album, we can say that the number of songs we know was four when the album was released, "Sue (Or In A Season Of Crime), which was re-recorded for the album, "'Tis A Pity She Was A Whore."
I'd like to say that "Girl Loves Me", "I Can't Give Everything Away" and "Dollar Days" are also very good songs.
When we look at it completely, it's built on a very powerful musical structure, but it's made with sincere, instantaneous sensations, "Blackstar"...
No death, no "comfort with the past" album...
It's just a real "end" album.
"The End" of a music life that is the masterpiece from the beginning to the end.
Turkey targeted in the Sultanahmet attack
Holger Münch, head of the German Federal Police Department, said on a programme on the German first channel ARD, on Tuesday, on the death of 10 German citizens in Sultanahmet Square.
Münch said that Turkey is not the target of the attack, but the target of the attack.
"In 400 PEOPLE'S EYE"
Münch said that the Sultanahmet attack did not change the danger of terrorism in Germany, and said, "We are still under threat that should be taken seriously."
The number of people who went to Syria from Germany to join Daesh has decreased, Münch noted that many people have returned from war zones.
"There are almost 400 dangerous people who should not be in custody right now," he said, adding that this is a major challenge for security units.
Münch has demanded that coordination between police agencies in Europe be improved and a closer communication.
Turkish officials stated that the suicide bombing that led to the Blue Mosque was a Syrian citizen and a member of Daesh, while German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere stated that the attacker had not yet been identified.
Sezen Aksu says goodbye to the scenes
Sezen Aksu, who decorated his 40th year with his concert series, fascinated his fans with the "Sezen Years" concert he gave at Volkswagen Arena last night.
The final ring of the concert series, which was held in July, took place at Volkswagen Arena on 15-16 January.
Aksu took all its listeners on a 40-year journey from yesterday to today.
In addition to the love songs that touched our personal lives, Aksu performed her songs on social issues that are closely related to our country and our world.
Aksu, who said that he would say goodbye to his stage life after performing the concerts he promised, saddened his fans.
At the concert "Sezenli Yıl," Sezen Aksu appeared in front of the lovers who filled the Volkswagen Arena with a separate story in each piece.
Each story, show, light and stage show took the viewers to different periods.
In the last part of the unforgettable concert, a video screening of Devrim Erbil's Istanbul paintings was also performed.
Aksu also hosted them on stage for the first time by taking part in the videos that his fans had previously recorded.
25 cents increase in bread in Ankara and Istanbul
In Ankara, as of yesterday, 250 grams of bread increased by 25 cents and started to be sold at 1 TL.
Before the new year, especially in December, on the rumors that "the bread will rise" will come, the Minister of Food, Agriculture and Livestock Faruk Çelik and the Minister of Customs and Trade Bülent Tüfenkci made statements as "no time."
However, in Ankara, the capital, 250 grams of bread was sold yesterday at 1 TL.
"The time was not done, the tariff decision started to be applied 2 years ago," said Halil İbrahim Balcı, President of the Turkish Bakery Federation regarding the 25 cent increase in bread.
"This was a tariff decision taken two years ago."
The Union of Chambers of Trades appointed this tariff two years ago.
A price applied throughout Turkey.
So there was no new raise application and no price increase.
But due to the competition, in some regions in Ankara, the tradesmen were selling for 75 cents.
In some areas, it was already sold for 1 TL.
The tradesmen who trusted their counters and bread were not lowering the price, because of the competition, they have to apply 1 TL.
No increase or a raise.
They're applying the unapplicated price.
"In the first half of 2016, the kilogram price of bread will definitely not exceed 5 TL and if we do not have a great problem, we will complete the year with this price."
In some parts of Istanbul, bread was sold for 1.25 TL.
Terror has bloodstained Burkina Faso this time
In the West African country Burkina Faso, 23 people from 18 different countries were killed in the attack, targeting a luxury hotel known to be preferred by foreigners and United Nations officials.
The attack was undertaken by the North African branch of Al Qaeda.
The attack in Burkina Faso took place four days after Daesh's terrorist act in Jakarta, the world's most populous Muslim country with a population of 250 million.
A Canadian and an Indonesian were killed in a daytime bombing and gun attack on the Starbucks branch and police station on a busy street with foreign embassies, luxury hotels and shops.
Indonesian officials have announced that the attackers were inspired by the November 13th Paris massacre.
Frank Garner, security correspondent for British BBC television, noted that this action has recently been part of a frightening trend that manifests itself in many cities around the world.
The United States was also hurt recently by the terrorist acts.
In early December, 14 people were killed in an armed attack by a Daesh sympathizer couple in San Bernardino, California, United States.
"San Bernardino" attack that shook the United States
"We have experienced two major attacks in Paris," reminding German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere that terrorist attacks have occurred in many parts of the world after the suicide bombings killed in Sultanahmet, "We have experienced two major attacks in Paris."
If we say that, then it'll be terrorized...
We used the phrase "without stepping back."
ISIS left Whatsapp Talks with Alrawi app
According to a new report, the terrorist organization is taking advantage of its own chat tool to communicate independently of chat applications such as Daesh, WhatsApp and Telegram.
According to Defense One's report, the organisation is taking advantage of a new messaging app to mess around.
This Android app called "Alrawi" is distributed and installed via an APK file.
The app allows the organization to communicate encryptedly and share media among itself.
ISIL's flash move in Iraq
The functionality of the application remains "principled" in the face of popular apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram, according to Ghost Security Group.
How strong the encryption used is unknown for the time being.
ISIL had previously performed all of its communications through the Telegram application, which allowed to send messages via encrypted connection.
However, Telegram uncovered the channels that ISIS members were talking about.
Moreover, the US administration is asking application developers to place back doors in their applications.
That's why the organization has now begun to use its own solutions rather than relying on WhatsApp and Telegram's encryption.
UAEA: Iran nuclear satellite to deal
Speaking at a press conference in Vienna, Kerry announced that Iran has fulfilled its part in accordance with the nuclear treaty and that the United States has officially lifted economic sanctions against Iran: Iran has met the necessary threats under the nuclear treaty.
Iranian President Hassan Rohani, in a message to the Iranian people on Twitter, announced his congratulations on the abolition of sanctions signed between six world countries and Tehran after the nuclear agreement.

How to evaluate the semester break?
We asked the training expert-student coach Murat Aydın how to evaluate the semester holiday.
For students, the semester break should not only be considered as rest, fun, spending time at the television and computer.
The semester break is a very important opportunity to prepare for the new education period and to review the past period.
The semester holiday, which is called leisure, is also an important opportunity for personality development, knowledge, skills and hobby acquisition.
Make a list of evaluations.
Write down everything you will do and try to apply everything you plan.
I assure you, you will enjoy this and have a very productive semester period.
Now let's talk about how an efficient semester period should be for student friends who are preparing YGS-LYS.
Because the most questions from the friends preparing for the YGS-LYS exams are: "How should we evaluate this period, do we have to solve a lot of questions, or do we have missing issues?"
In order to respond to these and to have a productive period, let's first enter our article with recommendations to the friends who are preparing for the exam.
While the preparatory process should be a process that starts from the 9th grade under normal conditions, we are trying to complete this in the last 1 year, which makes it more effective for us, more efficient, and more time for us to spend the last year using more effective, efficient and time-more.
In addition to exam preparation, the senior year must conduct the school's written work together.
Even though the graduate who completed the school took the exam at least once and experienced it, the year when the graduate will be preparing for the exam again as a graduate student is also critical for him.
Because most graduate students and their parents consider the year 'O' as the last chance, which creates a greater stress.
Studying is the work that the student does because he does not enjoy himself, he only makes himself obligated, and therefore he usually leaves it to the end, but for the students who make it a habit, this has become a completely task and what will be done is always within a plan.
Now we've got a semester vacation ahead, and we need to make the most of it.
And for that, we must have a plan that will allow us to manage the time well.
Studying on the Half Year Holiday:
Everyone should make a plan that suits their own situation first.
The 1st term has been taken care of, what is missing; the day, the week and the 15 days should plan the time.
During this period, there should be both repetitions and question solutions.
At the same time, students who do not have much shortage can also solve an average of 1-2 trial exams.
Inspect Your Missing Issues: Research shows that 75 percent of people have forgotten in one week, 66 percent in one day, and 54 percent in an hour.
The best and most effective way to eliminate forgetting is the repetitions.
Students who make a lot of mistakes from the past issues should focus on their general studies.
First identify your missing issues and plan day by day, place the subject for every day and take care of them.
This planning will comfort you both academically and psychologically.
Note that when placing topics on your plan, you are the most wrongful issues.
Because in the future, you won't have such a long holiday period.
Make Question Solutions:
It is as important to solve questions as repetition.
Because we can see how much we understand the work we do, but we can see from the feedback we receive through the question we have solved.
Don't forget to put a certain number of questions on every day.
The number of questions you will solve may vary according to the studies you will do on that day; you may not be able to solve a lot of questions in a day you are working on the subject, but we should at least see how much we learned about the topic of that day.
Determine Tests:
Another study during the semester break should be to solve trial exams.
Although all the subjects are not finished, you can at least do course trial tests.
Let's say that you have largely taken Turkish course and you can solve trials for 40 questions.
And do the time work while doing so.
If you can solve the 40 Turkish question in 60 minutes at first, if your next target is possible, let's be able to solve it in a few minutes.
Holiday And Hobby Plan:
Holidays, of course, not only do you mean studying; you should spend a few days for your holidays, rests and hobbies.
A holiday period that will only be spent by studying will prevent you from being discharged and resting.
Therefore, there should also be special times for you to set up for yourself in your plans.
Reading, watching TV, surfing on the Internet can be in your plans, most importantly, what time you will spend.
I'll have a little advice for friends who say they didn't have a productive period of my first period.
If you say that my first term did not go very well, I couldn't work hard and I'm too short, this semester holiday is a great opportunity for you.
But you have to decide and believe it first.
In the 2009-2010 season, the goals were scored between 76th and 90th minutes in the Turkish football superleague.
Now you answer the question you're asking, the game's over, and you're going to the locker room, or is the match still going, and there's a lot of minutes to score?
I guess no one wants to say, "We're going to look at the next game now," a classic comment used by a lost football team teacher or player.
Now all you have to do is leave the past and look in front of you, not walk, run.
If we gather what we say:
1) First make a semester holiday plan,
2) Do it again by going over the topics you know,
3) Take care of your missing issues,
4) Do issue reinforcements by solving questions,
5) Solve trial exams,
6) Read the book,
7) Set new goals for the new era,
8) Take time for yourself, hobbies and things you enjoy,
9) Take time for your family and friends,
10) Take the time for social and cultural activities (cinema, sports, theater, concert, excursion, picnic, etc.)
'Kervan' has taken a long journey
Karvan's founder, Şinasi Demirel and his son Hasan, who are one of the largest 'home' store chains in Turkey with an average of 45 stores of 1,000 square meters, added Home Sweet Home, which has 17 stores abroad and 25 domestic stores.
With the operation, which has recently been completed in trade registry, Kervan has also been the owner of 17 Home Sweet Home stores abroad.
Şinasi Demirel, who stated that there is still no caravan store abroad, said, "Now we will continue to store smaller with the carcass caravan, with the smaller store with Home Sweet Home."
"Kervan will also be opening abroad," he said.
With the merger of Home Sweet Home, which has a turnover of 50 million TL in 2015, and the merger of 90 million TL, a retail chain with a turnover of 140 million TL and a production of 140 million TL.
The total sales area of Kervan, which has 45 meters in 35 provinces, is 45 thousand square meters.
25 of the stores belong to the parent company.
There are about 500 people in the caravan.
Home Sweet Home has 17 stores in Turkey, and the total sales area is 6,500 square meters and the number of employees is 320 people.
Kadir Kalaycıoğlu, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Home Sweet Home, who produces, exports and merchandise with his partner Alev Pakten, stated that they are very pleased with the merger with Kervan and said, "We are from Mardin and we entered this sector in 1998."
From the beginning, we would come up with the support of Shinasi Gentlemen.
Shinasi Bey is the 'TRT' of this sector.
We've learned a lot from him.
In fact, we started our first step into the store when he gave us the Ak Central store.
We've already been working like a strategic partner, not as a rival.
"Now this merger will bring out a very serious synergy."
Kalaycıoğlu announced that Home Sweet Home currently has 17 stores abroad, weighing in the Middle East, and they also started exporting to China last month.
Kalaycıoğlu, "We opened our first corner in Shanghai."
We've got a deal with a chain of 200 stores.
"From now on, as a caravan of large retailing abroad, we will develop small retailing with Home Sweet Home."
Poroshenko sells his factory in Russia
Roshen CEO Vyacheslav Moskalevsky, who interviewed the Liga.net news site on the issue, said the factory was on sale for $200 million.
Moskalevsky, "Yes, we've put the factory on sale."
"As soon as we put it on sale, all the real buyers suddenly disappeared," he said, noting that there was no buyer.
Regarding the price of the company's factory in Lipetsk, Russia, Moskalevsky said, "We have determined it as about 200 million dollars."
Roshen, which produces 450,000 tons of chocolate and confectionery a year, belongs to one of the world's largest producers and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.
Yıldız Holding became Pladis abroad
Yıldız Holding has combined global companies operating in the biscuits and chocolate sectors it has acquired under the name of "Pladis."
With the merger that brings together the brands of De Met's, Godiva, United Biscuits and Ülker, a new food giant of 5.2 billion dollars was born, where 26,000 people worked.
Speaking at the meeting on the merger of global companies within Yıldız Holding, Murat Ülker, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Yıldız Holding, said "Being a global company was our goal from the beginning," and added:
Murat Ülker broadcasts live from Periscope for 335 million liras
Founded 72 years ago, this company is now moving to become a global brand, global company in the biscuit chocolate confectionery business under the name of Yıldız Holding.
During this time, we developed from retail to packaging, from real estate to personal care and in various industrial branches as well as biscuit chocolate confectionery.
We are at thousands of sales points with 77 factories and 300 brands operating in 14 countries.
Saying that the whole Yıldız Holding has created a "more than 50,000 people family," Ülker said, "Now we look at the opportunities in our family, we want to go back and focus on biscuit chocolate, that is, our main business, and we are reorganized for this, and we are reorganizing for this reason."
The life story of Mr. Sabri, the father of Ülker
We are reevaluating our company structure, reorganizing.
We've divided the world into territories.
And we've shared these areas with our CEOs.
Mehmet, Muhammad and Jeff will be our regional CEOs.
Mehmet Tütüncü, Turkey is responsible for the Middle East, K.Africa and Turkic Republics.
Mohamed Elsarky, our global Godiva business, as well as the Americas and Japan.
Jeff van der Eems will be responsible for England, continental Europe and Africa.
Ali Ülker, whom I can call the quality and innovation guru, will take global responsibility in his field, while Cem Karakaş will help me in the management of the business.
China, Russia will be partly the regions where we will build and develop South East Asia.
Murat Ülker sold shares at SAF REIT
Murat Ülker continued his words as "We promise happiness to the whole world in every bite," and said, "The name of our global company, which we established to realize this, is Pladis."
"Where did you invent the pladis, in fact, there is no special meaning of this name," he added:
The Aztecs call it Maya.
Japanese Subaru, Pervin in Iran.
In Arabic, Süreyya was inspired by the Latin seven star name of the Latina star, which is called Ülker.
So we've translated Ülker into a global one.
Ali Ülker, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of Yıldız Holding, emphasized that they started to create synergy in innovation by cooperating with laboratories in different countries and added:
We have very valuable R&D teams, we have achieved certain synergies so far in the work on an R&D platform by bringing these teams together.
We have 27 Ar-GE centers under Pladis.
The largest of them are in Turkey and the UK.
There are over 300 R&D experts working here.
Synergy studies have already begun to give the results.
The drajesi of Digestives (Nibbles), which is produced in Ülker and will begin its export to the UK, is produced in Silivri's chocolate factory in Ulker's chocolate factory.
Another synergy example: Ülker Krispi Knurled, which brands are different but products are the same.
We have adapted a pretzel technology developed in the UK, Jacob's Crinklys, to Turkey in a short time, and we have brought a beautiful taste to our country under the name Ülker Krispi Tırtıklı.
Laviva, which we all know very well, met with consumers in America today.
Call of Duty series exceeds 250 million limit
This series, where Activision, Infinity Ward, Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games have been named in gold letters in the game world, seems to be unforgettable for many years.
It is particularly evidence of how legendary we should find the number of newly announced sales.
Activision, which holds the license rights of the series, showed 250 million copies in the number of sales he shared exclusively at the end of the year.
The company, which shared the sales of the entire series at the beginning of last year, has managed to sell 75 million Call of Duty games since then.
And most of this number is undoubtedly the Black Ops 3 game, and we're not going to be wrong.
Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was elected once again as President
In the Ordinary Congress, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was re-elected as the President.
Kilicdaroglu, who received 990 votes from 1,238 delegates who voted, became the re-elected president.
248 of the votes were invalid.
After the announcement of the result, the party showed joy.
The CHP had a total of 1,275 delegates.
The Congress completed its work to meet at 10:00 on Sunday.
Kılıçdaroğlu summarized the following at the congress:
We'd like to play games here, sing songs.
But it's not heartwarming.
There is a fact of Turkey that cannot be governed.
The atmosphere that forms shades all of this.
The reason for the pessimistic painting is the rulers of the country.
As CHP people, we're against it no matter where terror comes from, no matter how it comes from.
Terror is a crime against humanity, and terrorists must never be forgiven.
The fight against terrorism is done with reason, done with knowledge, done with wisdom.
Of course we'll fight, we don't want anyone to bleed.
How is there any difference between photos in Syria, in Lebanon, in the southeast?
When I was sitting at the table, they made some serious mistakes.
The power is responsible for the blood flowing, the tears, the deaths.
In 2002, they took over the country with zero terror, and today there is a Turkey that has returned to a bloodbath.
Who is responsible for this?
The taxi driver in Diyarbakir, Şehmuz?
What does Turkey pay for?
We will sincerely attend meetings, convey our thoughts about the change of coup laws.
We will not allow a country to be built on anyone's personal opinion.
I say, "Come, let's change the batter spirit."
The intellectuals of this country have been raided and detained at the crack of dawn because they have expressed their thoughts.
There are aspects that we disagree with, but people should be able to express their thoughts freely.
This dictatorship says, "The state eats the bread and the enemy of the state."
I'd like to ask him, why didn't those who eat the state's bread and take advantage of all the resources of the state robbing the state?
The CHP is the party that brings the biggest changes to this country.
We'll all prepare for the fourth major revolution.
Whatever the cost, we will surely bring a liberal democracy to this country.
They can arrest us, they can detain us, no matter what they do, no matter how much the cost is, the CHP will bring freedom to this country.
I'm making a clear call to you, Davutoglu.
Hiding behind coup law, the man hiding has never thrown the coup mentality out of his head.
You've given the medal of superior service to the man who gave you a memorial.
What blow are you talking about?
It's all about deceiving the public.
Party officials listed the other three revolutions as follows: the establishment of the Republic by ending the reign of the 1st great revolution; the 2nd major revolution In the time of İnönü, the transition to a multi-party period from the single-party period; the transition to social democracy with the 3rd revolution Bülent Ecevit...
He has the qualities, the duties of the President.
Article 103 has the president's oath.
We know how important the concept of honor and honor is in this society.
If one person comes along and makes that promise, he will do it to his death.
Because honor and honor are indisputable for us.
The man with the dictator's degradation, what does honor and honor mean for you?
What do you understand honor and honor, why did you take this oath?
What does honor mean in you?
I want to know.
The concept of honor and honor in the religious man is the crown.
Their intention is not to abolish the law of coup, but to fortify the law of coup.
It's not enough they want the presidential system.
How the presidency, the presidential system with the boss.
Why do you reject the Parliamentary System of the Ottoman Empire?
Anyone who will order will do what is necessary.
Does the parliamentary function in Turkey?
No, it's not working.
If we bring in liberal democracy, the system will work.
They call it a coup d'état, but they strengthened the coup law.
Izmir MP Mustafa Balbay, who announced his candidacy for the presidency, could not participate in the race because he could not collect the signature of 128 delegates required for the nomination.
"I can't run under current circumstances," said Balbay, who can collect 92 signatures.
In the congress hall, MPs were divided by party assembly (PM), the central executive board (MYK) and the members of the honorary board, while former CHP Leader Deniz Baykal sat in the tribunes with the parties.
stanbul deputy Gülay Yedekçi sat next to the place where he left for the deputies, who came early and left for President Kılıçdaroğlu.
The meeting of Yalova MP Muharrem İnce with Kılıçdaroğlu was one of the issues discussed at the courthouse.
İnce said he did not accept that he had been offered to PM membership.
However, sources from headquarters claimed that the request for talks came from İnce and that PM membership was not proposed.
İnce shared a message from Twitter, "No one is that these sources of headquarters can be learned from Istanbul MP Ali Özcan."
Özcan said, "How can I know about the two people's interviews?"
He just said, "He's gone."
Kılıçdaroğlu often applauded the ba-press.
On the first day of the Ordinary "Democracy, Change and Brotherhood Congress" was marked by party assembly (PM) lobbies.
After the speech of the congress, Kılıçdaroğlu went to his home and started working for the PM list.
While preparing the list of 100 people of Kılıçdaroğlu, it was learned from the current members of the VAT that he did not want to take part in the management and said that he would be on the list by phone calling 13 MYK members except for the PM Yakup Akkaya, Sencer Ayata, Ercan Karakaş and the PM.
Kılıçdaroğlu may point to a list of 100 PM key, as well as another narrowed list.
In the final declaration of 21 articles, which was unanimously adopted in the CHP Congress, it was requested to remove the annotations on the European Local Government Specification, which came up with the discussions of autonomy of the TCC, and to increase the sharing of authority in the local area.
The declaration also included the objectives of "to end the party state order" and "to establish a state of law that is transparent and accountable."
Selçuk Özdağ, Vice-President of the AK Party, İdris Baluken from HDP and Ruhsar Demirel from MHP followed.
AK Party's Özdağ and the AK Party delegation left the court after Kılıçdaroğlu criticised President Erdogan.
"I looked at the criticism dose, I couldn't accept it," Özdağ said.
The banner "Peace" in Kurdish, Turkish and English "Peace" with the banner written "How will the darkness come to light" with the photographs of Can Dündar and Erdem Gül, which included photographs of journalists Can Dündar and Erdem Gül in the hall, drew attention.
The congress started in the morning with the songs of Grup Yorum and Ahmet Kaya.
The message sent to the convention by the wife of Diyarbakır Bar Association President Tahir Elçi, who died in the armed attack, received great applause.
Berkin Elvan's mother Gülsüm and his father Sami Elvan also attended the convention.
Kılıçdaroğlu, the part where he said that they would own democracy "death" regardless of what price to pay, was the most applauded part of the speech.
The CHP, which has gathered 52 conventions, 34 ordinary and 18 extraordinary, gathered its 53rd largest convention at Ankara Arena yesterday.
Participation was high.
There were more than 15,000 CHPs in the 12,000-seat hall.
However, there was no enthusiasm for the crowd.
The most exciting moment was the moment when Kılıçdaroğlu entered the hall with his wife Selvi Kılıçdaroğlu.
The excitement continued while the couple of Kılıçdaroğlu greeted the hall.
There was no sign of discipline in the AK Party conventions in the hall.
Even when Kılıçdaroğlu spoke, there was a great movement in the field of the Arena's field.
Evidently, the CHPs who wanted to enter the Party Assembly preferred to seek support by telling themselves to the party leaders and journalists.
"It's better for extrafinitive parties, such as the party meetings in Korea or the Soviet Union, than to sit motionless," a CHP executive said, explaining that this is not a bad thing.
The CHP convention is another difference from the AK Party or MHP conventions.
Only presidents talk at these parties.
In the CHP, the congress becomes a platform where party problems are also discussed.
When the number of party members who wanted to talk at the congress yesterday was high, the President of the Court Murat Karayalçın had trouble adjusting the time.
Although there was a "Homeland is going badly" in the faces and languages, there was also a distance against the comments "You will change the course with the painting coming out of this hall."
Although all CHPs said, "What to do", there was no consistent and strong answer to the question "What to do."
The fact that there will be no choice in the next four years has had a great effect.
When Kılıçdaroğlu took the stand, we journalists expected to answer the question "What to do."
First, Kılıçdaroğlu answered the question "What's going on?"
He noted the issue of journalists in detention, academics due to the statement, what happened in the southeast, the stalemate of foreign policy.
He responded to his party "Anatolian legends" about his party, such as "religious party" about the CHP, "supports coups" and "the party of the elite".
When it came to the "What to do" phase, instead of talking about concrete steps, he tried to reveal "strategy."
He stressed that all these problems can be overcome with stronger democracy and more justice.
He also made a promise on behalf of the CHP and said, "We will work no matter what the cost is until we bring democracy."
"We will fight to the death for democracy," he said.
One last note should remind that the CHP has dealt with the "organization" issue as of the 53rd convention and now manages to gather a class without any problems.
Meanwhile, a card was issued for 900 journalists who were told to follow the convention, but the participation of journalists in the hall was not at that level.
Representatives of media institutions in Ankara were not as keen on following the conventions of the AK Party.
Özyman was sentenced to life imprisonment
Indictment prepared by Diyarbakır Chief Public Prosecutor's Office against 7 defendants, 3. It was accepted by the High Criminal Court.
The indictment stated that statements were made under the name of "self-government" in some districts and neighborhoods of Diyarbakır, Istanbul, Şırnak, Mardin, Muş, Hakkari, Siirt, Bitlis, Batman, Van and Ağrı upon the instructions and calls of senior PKK/KCK terrorist organization.
The indictment stated that the leaders of the organization and youth and women were called for illegal acts, and it was noted that there has been an increase in bombing, long-barrel weapons and rocket launcher attacks against security forces, public institutions and organizations, citizens' homes, workplaces and vehicles in Sur, Bağlar, Silvan, Bismil, Lice, Tigris and Hazro districts of Diyarbakır.
Dissidents clash with Daesh, our police station was shot
The recent conflicts between the Syrian, Düden, Kara Mezra Bıgıddın and the Kara Köprülü Village against the Yavuzlu Village of Kilis, the conflicts between Daesh and the opposition groups of the Conquest Army in the village of Kara Köprülü continue to escalate.
The voice of weapons and mortars fired during the clashes between Daesh and dissidents, which continue at the near border, is also heard by Turkey.
Smoke rising from the areas where explosions often occurred is visible to the naked eye by Turkey, while security forces on the border line have taken intensive measures with armored vehicles.
On the other hand, harassment fire was fired at the Martyr Mehmet Border Station near the Yavuzlu Village of Kilis from the village of Bıgıddın, which was controlled by Daesh militants.
As part of the engagement rules, the soldiers responded to the area where the harassment fire was opened with howitzers and heavy weapons.
Russian fighters allegedly launched an attack on the village of Hamak, 17 kilometers from the Turkish border.
Six Syrians injured in the air bombing were brought to Kilis State Hospital for treatment by their relatives.

The couple primarily aim to pay the mortgage debt and help their relatives with the money they earn.
It was announced that the jackpot was divided into three.

FedEx's revenues mixed, financial outlook will fall in 2016
FedEx has reported disappointing results for the past three months, and the cargo giant has reduced the profit forecast all year, as demand for cargo services has decreased demand and ground handling costs increased.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasons of workers for holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasons of workers for holidays.
It fell about 2.5% in pre-opening trades 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening gong.
FedEx Corp. the fiscal year, which will end next May, is expected to earn between $10.40 and $10.90, he said, 20 cents less than previous estimates.
Analysts were expecting $10.84 based on research by FactSet.
The average increase of 4.9% on January 4th, and the heavy or large packages may fall despite the high-currency charges that will begin in November.
Cost cuts, higher revenues and profits from the growth of e-commerce are still expected to be higher than the previous year, the company said.
Fred Smith, the president and CEO, said the company "especially performs firmly in manufacturing and global trade, despite the weaker economic conditions than expected."
Holiday employment plans were announced a day after the competing company UPS, accordingly, UPS said it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers in the same number as last year.
During the quarterly period, which ended on 31 August, FedEx increased its income by 6% compared to the previous year, earning $692 million.
The earnings per share amounted to $2.42, falling behind $2.44 behind the estimates of the 12 analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
Income's up by 5%, $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx was hit last year by a decline in internationally-priority transport, which led to a stagnation of income in the Express unit.
However, the explosion in online shopping has upgraded the results of FedEx Ground Handlings.
In the last quarter, ground services revenue increased by 29%, but business revenue was basically stagnant due to large packages and high costs in internal insurance.
At high labor costs, the revenue in the cargo business decreased, while the express unit saw high income due to high base rates.
In pre-opening transactions about an hour before the opening gong, FedEx stocks dropped by $3.85 or a.m. with a decline of $3.85 or $2.5%.
They closed Tuesday with a 17% drop below the record level on June 11th and by 19% for the year.
During his most anticipated meetings over the years, Federal Reserve politicians decided that the time has come and not come for almost ten years, spending two days around a 27-square-foot Honduras maunu table this week.
The two-story meeting room on one wing of the central bank will be the mural of the United States.
Map Fed's Woman President Janet L. A reminder that Yellen and his colleagues put the nation's economic interests above everything else.
There are two tasks from Congress by the central bank: to maximize US employment and to keep prices there stable.
Since the Great Depression, Fed leaders have acknowledged that it is a third unwritten power of attorney: financial balance.
And this third proxy may be an X factor in an unpredictable decision on whether the US economy, which will be announced on Thursday, is ready to be cut from the short-term interest rate of close to zero, which has been announced on Thursday.
Although most data show that the economy is growing firmly, the latest turbulence in the global financial markets can still make careful Fed officials afraid to add vulnerability by increasing reference federal fund interest rates - even at a rate less than a percentage.
"Certainly, the first and most important thing they follow in the labour market and inflation" Lindsey M, chief economist of the brokerage company Stifel Nicolaus & Co. He said Piegza.
"But I think if they are looking for an excuse not to increase the rate, the growing uncertainty surrounding the global market will give them enough reason to wait a little longer," he said.
There's no consensus about what the Fed will do, and that's causing fluctuations in the financial markets within itself.
Half of the economists Bloomberg was recently interviewing for an interest rate increase this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to remain on standby with the main indicator, which is only about 30% likely to rise.
This may indicate a decrease in the stock market if the Fed increases, if policymakers do not mitigate the impact by promising that another increase could be on the way.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial index rose to 16.599.85 with an increase of 228.89 points or 1.4%.
"The rate of Fed policy makers of the increase has been triggered by the expectation that they will keep it stable this week," said John Lonski, a chief economist of Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising if Fed was currently increasing rates," he said.
If Fed executives had made such a decision, "they would have to take a long year to calm down the financial markets so they wouldn't panic."
Other experts suggested that a rate increase could calm the financial markets due to the rise of the fog curtain on when the Fed will take action.
Only a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on the way to increase the rate of this month by 0.25%, which would be a small step that strengthened the recovery of the United States on the way to slowly narrowing the monetary conditions.
Despite liberals complaining about a more economic process necessity, Yellen said he expects this year's rate increase in spring and early summer.
Although the speed of creating jobs decreased in August, growth in the labor market was stable this year.
Last month, the unemployment rate dropped to the lowest level of 5.1% for seven years, and approached the Fed's level of full employment.
Salary increases showed signs of improvement.
And although inflation remains below the central bank's annual target of 2%, Fed politicians said that the temporary effect of sharply declining oil prices is a significant reason.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the economy "can handle higher rates and it needs it despite the shortage in the labour market."
But the financial markets around the world began to shake after China went to devaluation in the currency at the end of last month.
The Dow Jones industrial index average fell to 16% below the record level in May, fearing that a slowing Chinese economy would bring down global growth.
The market has somehow splashed back, when Dow's now almost 10% below its high level in May.
Market turmoil for Fed policy makers makes it even more complicated to calculate the time when the interest rate will be increased.
Stephen D., senior research partner and previous Fed officer at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate. "In the last few weeks, they may have narrowed a little at this meeting, with the lack of news about the financial markets in the Chinese economy and the lack of news about economic weakening," Oliner said.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least another month to manage these effects better.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the effects on the US economy, and they have almost no data to rely on the further history of developments in China," he said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's primary concerns, so it should not be a factor in the technical decomposition processes.
In reality, however, the Fed has become the world's monetary official.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been very great.
Until then, President Ben S. The only clue from Bernanke was that in 2013 the Fed could "reduce" the financial expansion triggered by market tremors worldwide.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials may not only be expected to follow developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central bank managers and experts to read the global economy better.
The global strategy chief of the asset management firm Envestnet Inc., Zachary Karabell, said the decision-making process is "a talent rather than science."
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va. President Jeffrey Lacker noted this month that "Fed has overreacted to financial market movements that do not seem to be linked to economic foundations in the past."
Lacker, a member of the Policy-maker Federal Open Market Committee with voting rights and pressured the rate increase, cited the 1998-99 decisions.
"Despite limited identifiable recommendations for US growth," Lacker said, "Despite limited identifiable recommendations for US growth, the Fed's financial crisis has resulted in a cut of 0.95% points by 0.95% during the three meetings," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed officials recovered these cuts.
Adam S., one of the previous members of the Bank of England's ratio committee. "Fed should only put financial balance concerns at the fore during major crises, as in the 2008 market meltdown," Posen said.
He said the last turbulence isn't coming any closer to this level.
Because the markets are upset, you really don't want to be afraid to go to a rate increase, Peterson said that the President of the Institute of International Economy Posen.
The Central Bank Act still has two powers and does not talk about the financial balance, and I don't think they should act in this direction until that changes.

Brazil's Rio Grande Pediatrics Society promotes healthy nutrition during Breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatrician organization SPRS used a shocking method by including pictures of unhealthy food depictions depictions of milk children to try and tell women the importance of healthy nutrition in breastfeeding processes.
Human milk consists of many types of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which provides babies with all the nutrients necessary to develop a healthy immune system.
Due to energy surplus requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake to around 500 calories.
However, new research shows that the food supplements that mothers should take are not limited to calorie intake.
A new study led by Robert Waterland, professor of Baylor Medical College, Texas, responded to the genetic expression of pregnant women, affecting the genetic expression of pregnant women and protecting them from tumor development.
Unfortunately, unhealthy nutrition has been found to affect the child's immune system negatively.
Seven's Sunrise continues to excel ratings despite Nine's efforts to take the lead on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's moves to overthrow Liberal's leadership, but failed to provide a rating boost for Today.
After Tony Abbott's fall of Malcolm Turnbull, Nine's breakfast show was staged in national capital.
Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage in London, is trapped in the weekly international series, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance problem does not make much difference for Australian viewers, but today's average of 397,000 viewers in the five capitals in the five capitals.
Last Monday (317.000) compared to last Tuesday (283.000), the ratings increased slightly, but the figure was still behind last Thursday (343.000)
Today's been catching up with Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Sunrise's average Today was 310,000.
The difference at the beginning of the year was between 40,000 and 50,000.
Until today, the Sunrise average was 349.000, compared to today's number 314.000.
This is the most interesting thing that happens all mornings.
The winds of change affect their people this morning rather than from parliament!

The last three people think Single Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who's he gonna pick?
Has the secret come forward? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly demonstrated who will win the Beks.
The woman Sam Wood was going to choose at the end of his single program was in great secrecy.
And the other three girls are doing their best not to tell me who the last rose area is.
But if we check out Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski the day before the three people fell into two, they may have given a clue as to who the winner would be.
Sam Wood sealed his mouth until Thursday's final
In a lyrical language, the three women explained why Wood was perfect, and they emphasized his humoral ability, ambition, family values, and positive attitude, and why they wanted to be his partner.
But the answers to the question, "Who should buy Wood's last rose if you aren't?" may contain information about who wins The Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay the best candidate for Wood outside of themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been close since day one.
Jeavons-Fellows said: "From the moment I came home, I felt that they were suitable for each other by reading the energy of (Sarah) and Sam's energy, and I thought so throughout the program."
Markoski added, "Sarah is very practical, it's so much fun to be around her."
I saw them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They feel very well and comfortable when they are together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are gonna be a very good couple.
Mackay said last week's home-to-home dates made him think Wood was the right person.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that it was definitely not just a game - I am now fully committed to him."
When asked who Wood could choose without him, it was mysterious.
He said, "I don't know if I can say that."
"I love other girls equally - Snezana and Lana equals."
The Bachelor is broadcasting on Ten on Wednesday at 19:30.
First post: Is Sarah the best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options for where he would start his NFL career.
After Detroit and Seattle moved to the United States, they showed great interest in him, and after last year's impressive open training day, many other teams approached him.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and that seems to be a very wise decision.
Some coaches put Hayne on the bench for losing in the Australian rugby league performance, as was the 20-3 win over Minnesota on Tuesday.
But Tomsula believed this man, and he gave Hayne another chance and took part in a game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula continued to show his true color to the locker room after the play.
Instead of insulting the rookies in front of the whole team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also clearly supported Hayne at the post-match press conference.
Cam Inman, reporter for the 49ers team, said that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, and that he was advised to forget about his downfall and think about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne caused the Minnesoa Vikings to score in the first quarter and drop the ball
This was not what Hayne and his vast Australian fan base dreamed of his first game in the NFL.
Hayne was seen swearing on his way out of the field after dropping the ball, and later told Australian radio duo Hamish and Andy that he had no worse start for his NFL career at 2DayFM 104.1.
Hayne said, "This was just one of those things, you'll feel sorry for the next game, and that's it."
Hayne also reminded Queensland of Origin's first game of Origin with a back-pass.
Still, this was a great experience for the 27-year-old player.
Hayne posted the pose on Instagram when holding an Australian flag with fans after the game.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss homosexual rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested at gunpoint at a passageway in Siberia.

Police in Nepal Plastic Bulletin to Protesters 4 People Die
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed as police fired on the crowd protesting against the new constitution proposed in the country on Wednesday, an official reported.
The incident occurred Tuesday evening in the city of Rupandehi, 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
District official Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said that the protester from 1,000 to phases were gathered outside a police station, and some of them threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used pepper spray and fired in the air before using plastic bullets.
He said 20 policemen and five civilians were injured.
It is unclear why plastic bullets that are known to kill, but usually because they are less deadly alternatives, resulting in such a high mortality.
The conflict was the last of weeks of violent protests across Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group suggests that the new constitution and the proposed regions will dilute themselves's political impact.
The ethnic Tharus group, which wants to establish their own state, is also protesting in western Nepal.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed, 11 of whom are police officers in violent conflicts.
At this time, four major political parties agreed to divide the country into regions - it is also seen as an important but unrest creative step for the drafting of a new constitution in Nepal, which has been run by the central state for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that took place in April, which killed thousands of people.
Lawmakers have worked on draft constitutional provisions in Kathmandu this week, and officials say the new text will be issued by Sunday.
NHC says there is a 60 percent hurricane in the south of Cape Verde Islands
The US National Hurricane Centre said on Tuesday that a large low-pressure system, about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Cape Verde Islands, is 60 per cent likely to turn into a tropical hurricane over the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low-pressure system was also seen between Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles, and the Miami-based weather forecasting center said that the possibility of tropical hurricane occurring in the next two days is 60 percent.
Google launches donation matching campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has launched a donation-gathering campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organisations that have escaped from the war-harming and impoverished countries and aiding thousands of refugees to Europe.
Google announced the donation initiative on its blog with an unexpected personal approach.
Instead of making this statement by a manager, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who escaped Kabul with her family at the age of seven, wrote her personal experience.
"In our journey, there were hunger, thirst, cold and fear, as well as numerous dark buses and train journeys," he wrote.
I got lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many families like my family are in need of help.
Donations will go to four non-profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, the Savings of Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would match the first $5.5 million donation at google.com/refugeerelief until it collected $11 million.
Europe, 2. It has been facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, the main reason for this is the four-year Syrian civil war, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, which have been damaged by many wars, are also fleeing.

Weight loss surgery can help in patients with moderate obese diabetes
According to a new study, it may take at least five years to benefit from obesity surgery in moderate obese patients with type 2 diabetes.
However, it is still early to say whether diabetes patients who are moderately obese have lived longer than patients who have not undergone surgical intervention after obesity surgery.
Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr., who has written articles in the new study on JAMA surgery and is an expert in obesity surgery. According to Robin Blackstone, "it's a long time for the death to manifest itself."
Weight loss surgeries, also known as bariatric surgery, uses various methods to reduce the diameter of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and restrict the body's food digestive ability.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been proven to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the research was conducted on advanced obese people with body mass index (WI) 35 or higher.
The BMI, which is measured over the height ratio of weight, is considered normal from 18.5 to 24.9.
The 25 or more BMI indicates that the UN person is overweight, and those above 30 BMIs are considered obese.
BMI can calculate at the link 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, Taiwan's full-fledment Min-Sheng Hospital has used two types of bariatric surgery in the treatment of moderate obese patients with type 2 diabetes since 2007 - from the experiment they compare than gastric bypass and tube gastric surgeries.
Since the end of the fifth year of the study, the average of those who had surgery declined from the UN 31 to 24.5.
In response, the BMIs of those treated for non-surgical diabetes remained stable around 29.
Diabetes was partially resolved in 28% of 36% of the surgeries.
In the group treated in medical ways, diabetes was partially dissolved in only 1% and only 2%.
According to the authors, blood pressure control, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were generally better in the "persurgically interfering group."
Researchers also viewed the blood levels of A1c hemoglobin, which reflects blood glucose in patients over time.
Researchers say it's best to keep A1c hemoglobin below 7%.
After the operation, A1c hemoglobin decreased from an average of 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the group undergoing medical treatment, it remained stable by around 8 percent.
However, with the improvement of A1c hemoglobin levels, this better "glycemic control" is the researcher, Dr. According to Chih-Cheng Hsu and his teammates, he did not reduce the mortality rate within these five years.
The research team compared the findings to these two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the group with bypass surgery compared to tube gastric surgery had lost more weight (18.7 to 14.2 kg), in BMI (7.4 to 5.1,1%) and also in A1c hemoglobin (3.1% to 2.1%) decreased and the total decline of diabetes was higher than 16.7% (46.9%).
Although the research did not indicate a clear benefit of post-op survival at the end of the fifth year, Dr. Dr. According to a study conducted in more overweight patients in Sweden, Blackstone said that the surgery has valid data that prolongs life expectancy.
In this study, the Swedish study was 29 percent lower than another group that had undergone bariatric surgery and the prospect of dying within 15 years.
Although this new study has not shown the benefits of survival of patients with surgery, according to Blackstone, this is reassurance for people who are under BMI 35.
This is the most crucial part of the article, because the BMI says that this surgery is safe in the low group, there has been no increase in death risk or renal disorders, he said.
People and doctors should start taking weight gain seriously, Blackstone added, as the patient falls below 27 to 30.
I think we've waited long enough for people to take this seriously.
I think it's really hard to reverse these genetic changes that make their bodies related to obesity and diabetes.
"Everyone is impossible to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Stating that Europe cannot host all refugees, Dalai Lama added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the countries of refugees.
At the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK, Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis at the opening of the Dalai Lama Conduct Centre, which will work on ethics.
He claimed that under the current conditions, the interests of humanity should be put at the forefront rather than the interests of countries or continents.
He also stressed that the responses of countries in Western Europe to the refugee crisis, although it is appreciated, are inadequate for this situation.
"Everyone is impossible to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although he appreciates Germany and Austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, the Dalai Lama said they were only through a temporary solution.
"It's great to deal with a few thousand refugees, but you also have to think about long-term solutions, and you should consider how you can bring lasting peace and lasting development to these Muslim countries, basically through education," he stressed.
We need to think about how to reduce deaths in our country.
We need to reduce power.
The use of power has never been a solution to problems," he added.
Addressing the issue of violence, Dalai Lama also addressed George Bush's actions following the September 11 attacks and said that the United States' violent responses had initiated an uncontrollable chain of events.
In my letter to President Bush after 9/11, I conveyed my condolences and stated that the way to solve this problem is nonviolent methods.
I know that his motives are well-intentioned, but he used force and caused unexpected results," said Dalai Lama.
4 times increase in hand antiseptic swallowing in children in the last 4 years
Since 2010, the U.S. State's toxic control centres have reported an increase of nearly 400 per cent in high alcohol-containing wet wipes in children under the age of 12.
Georgia Head of the Poison Center, Dr. According to Gaylord Lopez, hand-held antiseptic swallowing cases in children reported to the centre increased from 3,366 cases in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are more in demand for such products, and unfortunately, there are those among them in the percentage to be lifted to the emergency," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drank hand antiseptics, while others did it in impressing their friends or in a social media claim.
The videos on YouTube show adolescents who drink antiseptics for the sake of cheap drunkenness.
Some adolescents have been reportedly mixed the antiseptic mixture with alcohol-containing mouth juices to obtain a harder drink.
Young children can be caught in the fragrances of antiseptics that are attractive.
Lopez said, "The boy doesn't think it's a bad thing."
Most scented ones of more attractive (hand antiseptics).
There are strawberries, grapes and orange-flavored hand antiseptics that are extremely attractive to children.
Hand antiseptics contain between 45 and 95% alcohol from 45 percent.
Especially in young children, only a few fels can cause alcohol poisoning.
Dr. Dr., head of the mall for poisoning at the University of Kansas Hospital. Stephen Thornton said to Fox 4 television in Kansas City, "highly concentrated alcohol."
You don't leave a few whiskey glasses around, but people leave these hand antiseptics in the center, and that's an easy way to get a lot of alcohol for kids.
In recent school, six-year-old Nhaijah Russell, who swallowed only four berries-smelling hand antiseptic, was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
The alcohol content in his blood was 0.17, the emergency room doctor Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. According to Chris Ritchey, this rate was twice the legal alcohol limit accepted in an adult person.
Nhaijah couldn't pronounce the words and couldn't walk when he came to the emergency room.
According to Rithey, the doctors kept him under observation at a separate children's hospital during the night, despite any signs of brain trauma, as the alcohol caused the little girl to fall and hit the head.
Anne Ortoria told Scott CNN that "it was very scary."
It could be lethal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to keep the contact with skin short and remove them from places beyond the reach of children.
Other than alcohol poisoning, some antiseptics have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died of swallowing hand antiseptic, containing an unnamed poisonous substance.
Health officials suggested that the substance could be methyl alcohol, not ethyl alcohol, but as stated in the contents list.
In January, three fourth-year students from the north of New York, according to police reports, conspired by "putting antibacterial products around the class" in order to poison their "bad-hearted" teachers.
The teacher forbade his use in the classroom because he was severely allergic to hand antiseptic.
The police described this plan as "an attempt to vain" and proposed disciplinary punishment to the school administration.

The bitch is innocent!
The killer's out there, waving, staring at us, smiling at us.
Some try to divert attention.
While the killer is right in front of us, instead of pointing to the killer, he's creating opportunities for him to escape.
He's shielding the killer.
He's hiding it.
And after he disappeared, he says he wasn't really guilty of anything.
The quarrel we've had in the last 10 years is very clear.
Someone wants to narrow down the fire circle around us and burn us.
Someone's trying to stop it, and moreover, it's trying to put out the fire around us.
Someone's trying to tear it down, to plunder.
Someone's trying to do it, to produce.
There are those who reproach us, our territory, all kinds of war.
Civil war.
Intergovernmental war.
The war of sects.
The proxy war.
And they have subcontractors.
Dirty terrorist organizations.
Bloody clowns.
Different names, formats.
Turkey has no choice but to fight each of them.
He's fighting, and that's why he's going to have to deal with the evil of all of them.
Continue to fight until you're sure of their evil...

Bus-sized crocodile fossil found
It was reported that the length of the prehistoric naval crocodile was 10 meters and 3 tons of weight.
The crocodile's only length of the skull was measured at 1.6 meters.
Researchers named the genre "Machimosaurus rex" and published the findings in Cretaceous Research magazine.
Federico Fanti from the University of Bologna, the editor-in-chief of the article, noted that the fossil, which appears to be 130 million years old, is "almost the size of a bus."
Fanti told the Washington Post that the gigantic saltwater crocodile "was at least at the top of the food chain in a certain region at that time."
Paleontologists reported that M. rex, thought to be the largest crocodile living in the sea, was ambushed in the lagoons.
The largest freshwater crocodile in history is thought to be the "Sarcosuchus imperator" that lived 110 million years ago in Africa and South America, which could reach 12 meters and weigh 8 tons.
They're all so confused!
Author Ece Temelkuran's first book 'All Women's Heads Are Mixed', and Aysa Production Theatre adapted to the theater under the same name.
Selen Uçer, starring Deniz Çakır, Zeynep Kankonde, İpek Türktan Kaynak, Kadir Çermik and Şebnem Sönmez.
The play 'Poz' and 'Dry Tight' continues for the first time, where Uçer has experience as a copywriter and director, questions the confusion in women's minds.
The game met with the audience at the Trump Show Center last week.
The play starts with the radio theater.
In the dark, a voice that led us to the past years...
Then the curtain opens.
He's standing by the window, a woman who's about to jump down.
It's clear who he is and why he attempts to commit suicide, that his next-door neighbors intervene.
A LET'S LEFT
"Ebru Uysal" played by Deniz Çakır is a popular writer.
He was abandoned by her husband, but that's not the only reason.
There's been things that have accumulated since you were a child.
The fact that he could not taste the love of the father, his exclusion in his student life, his childhood, his wrong relationships, his thought that he was not understood; he brought him to this point.
He decided to commit suicide by leaving a letter behind, but he can't jump out the window.
Because the baptist and pure cleaner of the next circle 'Aysel' (Zeynep Kankonde) and the mysterious woman sitting in the opposite apartment 'Perran' (Sebnem Sönmez) keeps him in the word.
They're approaching the situation as normal, usual.
She's getting more tense and can't concentrate and jump.
When the famous singer 'Meltem Kaya' (Silk Turkdan Kaynak) who cleaned her house in the conversation between the threes, the incident turns to the racket.
"Meltem," which approaches the situation with its own naive and sincere style, cannot stop singing when he sees the crowd below.
This interesting suicide attempt takes a different dimension when the real estate agent 'Murat (Kadir Çermik) enters the girl's house with a spare key.
The fact that the singer's "Meltem" false information to the press is driving things out of hand.
The play also uses Nazan Öncel's song 'Street Girl'.
THE STEEL
Uçer, who made the regime for the first time, managed to ensure the tempo and fluency of the game.
The comedy load of the game is drawn by Zeynep Kankonde and İpek Türk.
The cartoonized types played by the two manage to make the audience laugh with their gestures and their lines.
While Şebnem Sönmez conveys the experience of the years to the stage very well, Deniz Çakır performs convincingly to reflect the depressing mood of 'Ebru Uysal'.
Kadir Çermik, who mentioned his name with Tolga Çelik's award-winning film 'Sarmaşık', is accompanied by these four women successfully.
The one-act play, described as a depression comedy, promises to laugh without confusion.
Those who remember from those beautiful words that come out of the mouth of Perran, which is played mostly by Şebnem Sönmez, are as follows: They read the writing of the play; they will experience and see.
All the kids thought of dying once to punish their parents, and for some reason, they've always cried.
She's hanging in the air like an unexplained joke.
She's always looking for a funny story that she's forgotten her most important place.
In fact, every story begins with a kind of abandonment.
I have to put my hands in my pocket sometimes, and I can't stand the pocketless stuff.
One wonders where you put your hands.
Astonished, our hands grow.
People talk after what you don't understand, and they make it up.
A misunderstanding would come true.
All women are confused because they are confused.
Since you're not doing dead, you have a chance to live.

Putin licks spitting
Russia is preparing to grant Turkish companies the status of "Can do business with Russia" if Turkey cannot meet the services it offers in any other way, while the Russian Tour Operators Association "Russian citizens do not give up Turkey."
Calculating that the breakup of existing economic ties with Turkey would bring additional costs to Russia, the Russian Ministry of Economic Development prepared and issued a new "Istigation Situations" proposal for Turkey.
According to the draft published in the Russian Federal Regulation, it is envisaged that Turkish companies and companies will be allowed to do business with Russia, even if they enter the sanction area if necessary.
According to the draft, it is impossible to provide from other sources other than Turkey, or if domestic production in Russia will bring significant additional costs, the products and services of Turkish companies and companies can be used.
Which Turkish goods and services will be included in this category will be determined by a mixed commission to be established in partnership with other relevant ministries within the Russian Ministry of Economic Development.
Thus, which Turkish company can work with Russia can be selected by the bureaucrats and decided.
According to the same document, government agencies in Russia and private companies will have to prove to the commission that they are not interested in what they will do with Turkish partners.
If the draft is approved by the Russian government and enters into force, the registration of the privileged Turkish companies in Russia will also be established.
The Russian Association of Tour Operators said yesterday that Russian citizens did not give up on Turkey.
"Despite the ban on tourism and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' recommendation not to go to Turkey, our citizens began to search for the formula for organizing their holidays alone," the statement said.
The number of articles titled "The most practical and cheapest way to vacation in Turkey" in social networks on the internet is growing like an avalanche.
The most common suggestion is to book hotels online and fly with THY.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitriy Medvedev described the price of oil below $30 as a "dramatic" development for Russia.
"It was a terrible surprise for our government, just as no one thought that the oil would fall to $30.
At this rate, it does not seem that the budget will not be fulfilled in its current form."
It's the last month of 2015 we've left behind.
Russian President Vladimir Putin announces that economic sanctions will deepen after the plane-fall crisis.
In those days, our businessmen, who are trying to go to Russia in the usual order, are officially suffering at the border crossings of THY.
Turkish goods are being driven at customs, subjected to unthinkable controls.
It's not much, it's a month, and yesterday Nerdun Hacıoğlu from Moscow reports.
One way or another, sanctions are soft.
But why?
It's very simple.
It's because you're closing the border crossings with the methods of a century ago in an era where the economy is so globalized that you're trying to turn political battles into economic war anymore.
Look, we're still writing news about how the years of economic embargo have been drilled into Iran.
Two neighboring countries, which seem to be a lot of friends like Russia and Turkey, but are not at their core, are actually in need of each other.
It is not technically possible to break these two countries that mingle with businessmen, tourists and entrepreneurs and customers on a night like that.
If you close the doors, the people of these two countries will enter each other's country through the chimney.
It is best to make political debate on the table and settle accounts there without creating sanctions new Reza Zarrabs (Rıza Sarraf).
Without any infecting the economy...

The suspects were detained.
The teams who examined the laptop computer used by M.M.G. and R.O. obtained a large number of video recordings belonging to the mini-camera device established to capture the passwords of the citizens who traded at ATMs and determined that the suspects stayed in the provinces where they went to avoid being caught.
It was also revealed that the suspects obtained an unfair profit of 50 thousand liras with the copying process they made on 15 different ATMs in Izmir.
The suspects, who were transferred to the courthouse after their police procedures, were arrested.
Officials have warned citizens to check their account movements regularly against such incidents and to screen them with their hands during the entry of the password at ATMs.
Netherlands: Assad must be tried in The Hague
Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad should be tried at the International Criminal Tribunal (ICC) in The Hague.
Speaking at a conference in The Hague, Koenders said Assad was responsible for the influx of asylum seekers.

However, I am aware that Assad will not leave his post soon.
This issue should be discussed first, and Russia needs help in this context.

De Boer, who is currently an Ajax ambassador, said: "They no longer give the summary of the Celtic matches in the Netherlands, why?"
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
People don't just talk about Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Team.
They talk together when they talk from the teams, they're interested.
The old team's games were high, and it wasn't just the Scots who wanted to watch those games.
Deila swore I'll make things right
RONNY acknowledged that Deila Celtic had a fight, but the Norwegian boss stated that the departure would reverse.
The defeat against Malmo and then the loss to the Champions League was followed by a five-pointer match against Aberdeen, who was now the leader in the score table with a five-point margin.
"Celtic has had a bad time in the past," Deila said. We'll come back again."
Now we want to show ourselves as soon as possible.
I know the situation is very disappointing and many people are angry or upset about what's going on.
We are in the same situation - but we have to continue.
We really, really need Celtic's support because it makes players feel much better.
It's so important to stay together now.
Warburton's January transfers titties
Despite comments that he set some January transfer goals just a week or two ago, Rangers' boss Mark Warburton is afraid of his signature, insisting that he does not want to break Ibrox's team.
"The January transfer window is very different from the summer window," said the former Brentford teacher.
For the players who come in the summer, there is a pre-season period in which you will familiarize them, this season we have seen this season in our own group.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes it hurts more to add unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic targets Michu for retirement
Swansea's strikers, Michu, was connected to Celtic in the transfer window, and after his contract with the Swans, he was unable to retire.
At the age of 29, he suffered irresistible pain from a troubled ankle for two years, and the summer did not find a way to get out of Wales.
Hearts prepare for the SFA battle on Neilson's comments
When Paterson was kicked out of the game, the Hearts were 2-1 ahead, and then they lost 3-2, the defender's red card reversed everything - Collum's third red card to be cancelled in eight months.
Neilson does not give up what he says, he continues to insist: "I have never questioned the union, I have not commented on the performance."
Griffiths attempts to prevent Tynecastle
The Obstege Grant was reprimanded when he sang an aggressive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in March 2014 in a bar in the Roseburn district of Edinburgh, prior to the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle.
"It was a derby match, and there was a warmth of that moment," said the attacker, adding: "I can definitely say this, I will no longer go to Tynecastle except for a match with Celtic.
Tannadice board trusts Dundee United administration - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly still has confidence that the board of directors' board's board of directors will fix things - but they agree that the decline in the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We will make the children ready to go back on the road," Donnely said.
Mclness is pleased with the "ugly win" against Hamilton
Derek Mclness admits that Aberdeen's penalty in the first half of Adam Rooney has to hold on to the Hamilton Accies desperately to see their seven consecutive wins, bringing them to the top of the top five points over the score table in the league.
Mclnnes said: "There is no team that wins anything without winning a match, whether in the middle, trophies or leagues."
Unemployment rates in England increased, while the odds remained the same among the Scots
UNEMPLOYMENT remained unchanged between 164,000 in Scotland between May and July, while the number of unemployed people in the UK increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million.
According to the National Statistical Office (ONS), the unemployment rate in Scotland was higher than 5.5 per cent in the UK, with 5.9 per cent.
In Scotland, however, employment fell by 12,000 in three months, and currently the number of working people remained 2.612,000.
For Scotland, the employment rate has dropped to 74.0 per cent - above average 73.5 per cent in the UK.
"The government's long-term plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy," said State Minister David Mundell in charge of Scotland, commenting on the latest figures.
It's been almost a year since Scotland decided to remain part of England.
In these 12 months, we have seen improvements in the Scottish Labor Market with increased employment and unemployment decreased.
Why I'm a Witness to an execution in Oklahoma
I'm going to watch a man be killed later today for a late legal intervention.
I hope not, but if it does, I'll sit in the death room watch gallery at Oklahoma State Prison while Richard Glossip was executed with a fatal injection.
He wanted me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
The invitation was first made in January through his best friend, and as shock as I was, I accepted.
As I got closer that day, I began to fear it.
So why am I doing this?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about a death penalty.
It will offer a unique perspective.
True, journalists are allowed to monitor executions in the United States, and because there is more practice than the current places, a terrible lottery emerges when deciding who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced media seats from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen will watch without getting his feelings.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossip's best friends, and over the past few months, I've developed a relationship with him after phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I love that guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The authorities in the prison said I couldn't be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be given pens and notebooks to record what I saw.
I'll try to remember all the details.
A journalist from the ocuphoma accused me of compromising my neutrality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes, get access.
I complained to him.
He also admitted that he could "prove this better," but he still thinks what I did was wrong.
Richard Glossip disagrees with me in some of the things I say and write.
He won't tell me what to write, and if he did, I wouldn't have agreed to it.
I told him he could take me off the list of witnesses when he wanted to.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write these.
If he dies, he thinks it will help the public spreading to the public, helping the anti-death movement.
He's a reporter from the Huffington Post, and Kim Bellware will be with me.
If you want to know more about this, please listen to the podcast series I have prepared.
I'm not going to reassociate all the details here.
I have no firm idea that Richard Glossip is innocent.
What Barry Van Treese did after his death is enough to make himself an accomplice.
But I still believe he's not guilty of murder.
I absolutely do believe there is not enough evidence to legitimize a death penalty.
I think his execution was wrong.
And I'm going to watch her die from that perspective.
I can't really claim to be objective.
You can look at the other reporters there for that.
The impressions you'll get from me will be the impressions that you'll get from the viewer of the death of a man he likes who are unnecessarily killed.
After the wet-criting police chase, the man was persuaded by the Canning River
Canning Vale stayed dry when the police officer persuaded him to take him out of the Canning River.
The allegation of running away from a police car behind a man from Perth ended in a shallow and muddy water, an attempt by a police officer "to persuade him to come back to the shore gently".
Canning Vale police were called in on Tuesday for trespassing in Beckenham.
When they saw the suspect, he broke into the Canning River and tried to escape the police.
But he didn't get far.
"Deputy Commissioner Shandell Castledine, he was standing in the water and said, "I'm not going out, so come get me."
Police Officer Lachlan Perhavec did not want to wet his uniform and used a safer tactic - "good police negotiation".
"Sometimes people are trying funny things to try to escape," said Senior Commissioner Castledine.
Champion footballer Ben Cousins provides a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins left his car to escape alcohol control and attempted to cross the Swan River.
Their efforts failed, but the locals inspired the plan of a pranky Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the butlers ratted him out and threatened to quit the race
Peter Moody claimed that the Racing Victorian butlers tried to prepare a setup in their own stables last year and threatened him to leave the race immediately.
Racing Victoria targeted the butler and the unity department, and said they were running a personal campaign against her to leave Lady Tatai out of the race during the last feed Wednesday for the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do the best in the races, and that he found Lidari in difficult conditions that he could not explain when he gave the positive result to the kobal.
He said he didn't want to look like "good grapes" that he had bitten his tongue for 18 months in the face of sckles allegations.
"I wasn't going to say this, and I've covered it up for a long time, but sometimes you get so angry, and everything just happens."
They know this is going on.
Sometimes you react, and you stand up to his consequences, and I'll suffer the consequences.
I'll sleep well tonight when I go home.
I want to walk around high, and my bosses know that I'm trying to do my best for them.
When they start thinking I wasn't doing this, I shouldn't be a trainer anymore.
If I did, I'd think about what I'd do with my license.
Previously, Moody set off a bomb in a racing.com interview accusing the unit department of being in an effort to snitch in its own stable.
"Eightteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - if asked - I would call it - and they offered to give him a job in my stables in exchange for telling them what I was doing in my stables," Moody said at Racing.com.
They obviously believe I'm a hustler.
If that's the case, they all have to return their badges because they weren't capable of catching me.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, the new president of RVL, and the current general manager of RVL, knew that at the time, and now they know it.
Does this make me think you're starting to be personal?
RVL has a series of balls, and maybe he wants to make anyone except the trainers responsible for what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe the people out there think I am.
Maybe they need to get my license and throw me out, but I have no doubt what my words will make them think.
But I don't care about anything at the point where I come from, and it makes me sad.
It really upsets me.
I'll put pressure on them, I'll put them on the responsibility to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I walk.
The coach's disappointment over the long-standing cobalt investigation involving Lidari and the next scratch has made him say, "Throw my license across the table."
Moody, who became famous for preparing the undefeated champion Black Havyar, described the race day maintenance rule as "crady" and stated that mud or clay porridge was against the rules of being dragged to the horse's feet.
This is against the rules of race.
I must take full responsibility for this."
One of my men accidentally drove the mud to his feet.
He could have taken it last night.
He could have taken it yesterday, which it did.
It took the day of the race.
As a result of the investigations opened by the managers, Moody may face a three-month suspension for using porridge in the caravan of the race day care.
That's a joke.
Those who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We understand that we need the rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who hit and escaped in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested the man who hit a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend.
On Saturday morning, the cyclist was taken to Royal Melbourne Hospital by air due to serious injuries after a car hit him on the Murray Valley Highway.
The police said the hit driver ran away from the scene without helping the injured.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia surrendered to a police station in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with an accident, not helping, and other traffic crimes.
The 40-year-old Cobram cyclist remains stable in the hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy responds harshly to rivals' allegations of wrestling
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy described criticism targeting his team as an "creating day" effort for NRL's two favorite first.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said in the semi-final in Sydney on Friday night that Storm was defeated by the referees allowed the referees to "fight" with their own team.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a "breed" match for the rugby league after a semi-final match against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, making a "exclusive" referral to Storm, describing it as a "very big" in wrestling.
Bellamy defended the team's struggle and said that they were focusing solely on "contact" while fighting.
Bellamy said that it was powered by criticism from the two leading teachers' team, as it meant that Storm would defeat them.
This arrival continues - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when they beat us 24-2, said on Wednesday, Bellamy said.
I guarantee we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or techniques all year round, we've only put a real emphasis on our struggle contacts in the last six weeks, and that's a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and he's obviously a big team he's been teaching, and he's probably not used to losing with a little shock for himself.
It's funny how this happened at this time of year.
Bellamy objected to Bennett's idea of "exciting football," Bennett's 2010 St. George-Illawarra Dragons reminded his teacher who won the title by playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He made the subject of comparing our match on Saturday night with our Friday night match, and how exciting their game was."
I remember in 2010 that St George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he wouldn't even give off a mouse ass.
But now he's got a team that we can call exciting football, and he's got a team to play football, especially with his speeds, he's got young halves.
This is the football you want to play when you have players like this.
In 2010, he put this point, now everyone wants to play football in this style - not every team has half (doubles) like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play like this.
It gives me more confidence because even they talk like that because they're a little afraid to play.
When they went to big games, six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm and Roosters match had a higher score than the Broncos and Cowboys match.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
Our game is 20 to 18, and in our game, the score of both sides is more, but that's exciting football?
Or is it exciting to cut off attacks, but not to make score-in-velocating attacks?
I think that's the agenda.
If they're talking about us, that means we're going to meet them here at a later stage.
Storm, North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks tickets are on sale on Tuesday, because he won't be entertained at AAMI Park on Saturday night, so he's not here this weekend.
Serbian man released on bail of $200,000 for drug offences
The man who was caught in Queensland on 40 kilograms of cocaine and faced a possible life sentence was released on bail for $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men caught last month by federal police who tracked down 100 kg of drugs from the Solay yacht, which came from South America via Vanuatu and was sent to the port on Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen at the marina during the morning with his accomplices at the marina, and then met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs inside a Toyota Echo.
Despite the possibility of a potential life sentence for possession of commercial cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer said there was no evidence that he had attempted to possess all the drugs and that he could be in the cafe for an innocent purpose.
Peter Flanagan, the Supreme Court Judge, was concerned that Maksimovic was at risk of escaping.
They have open contacts to Serbia.
He travels frequently to Serbia," he said on Wednesday.
He lied about where he was staying at the police in the public case.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather offered him $200,000 to bail him out.
"It is clear that the bail cost of $200,000 after both people read their sworn statements constituted a real financial burden on them," Judge Flanagan said.
But he warned that it wasn't enough alone to keep him from going to the case.
Maksimovic was released on bail in exchange for delivering both Australian and Serbian passports, going to the police station every day and complying with the 6:00 p.m. curfew.
Stevan Hogg used the girls' phone to lure pedophiles to send images
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for child abuse images.
Stevan Hogg received the girl's phone while sleeping, logged in to an online messaging service, providing him with a series of inappropriate child images sent to him by another user.
She woke up and realized that she didn't have a phone, and she found her phone in the hands of Hogg, who was sleeping.
He looked at him and noticed disturbing messages before he immediately warned his mother.
The police took care of it and saw five pictures, then analyzed the computers at the address, and discovered "relationship" web searches using terms of finding inappropriate children's pictures.
Hogg later claimed that the reason he did this to the officers was to "manage the pedophiles" on the Internet and "to act like police and intimidate them."
Eilidh Robertson, a Mali deputy, told the Sheriff's Court of the Worlddee: "This is an addiction - he said he was an addict who scares people.
He admitted that the calls were made on the computer, but he said he did it to act like a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about the interviews with him who asked him to send more pictures with the unknown person who sent the pictures to him.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he had sick ideas when he drank and wanted to watch footage of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When she found the messages on her phone, she screamed and trembles and cries.
The mother saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone and the charges followed.
She was interviewed and she said she was using a computer and a Playstation to look younger than the defendant.
Hogg, 23, who lives in Ward Road, Dundee, was found guilty of taking or producing inappropriate pictures of children on June 14th last year, violating bail on January 25th this year, and not attending the court on March 24th this year.
The defense attorney Gregor Sim said that Hogg was not included in the category of sexual crimes, because there was no "certain sexual element" in this crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the case until October, when the social background report was scheduled.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but was taken into custody for other unusual cases.
Sexual offences were recorded before the date of the sentence.
Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe speaks wrongly in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest leader in Africa, fell down the stairs earlier this year, when he was coming down a podium.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was tarnished by opposition lawmakers' claims that if they booed him during Mr. Mugabe's speech, they received anonymous death threats.
In his speech to the nation in parliament last month, they booed him and kept interrupting - he repeated the same speech on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said that seven opposition politicians had received messages to their mobile phones so that they would not disturb him during Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"After Mr. Mugabe's speech is over, the message comes from an unseen number to journalists, but the title is 'death'," he said.
He says his immunity to the members are valid within parliament and that immunity is not functioning when they leave parliament.
The party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, has been "concerned" because of threats to politicians, the chief spokesman said.
Hewlett-Packard will cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard will end 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in line with efforts to restructuring and cost reduction in corporate service business.
HP will be divided into two listed companies later this year; the faster growing company will separate the computer and printer business from hardware and service operations.
The expected layoffs would result in a $2.7 billion in expenses at the beginning of the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring activities will provide a more competitive and sustainable expense structure for the new Hewlett Packard Company," said Meg Whitman, head of HP, who will preside over the post-dissemination unit.
"Whitman,Hewlett Packard Company will be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we will have a wide and deep portfolio to help companies move into a new business style," he said.
As a separate company, we are in a much better position to meet the growing needs of our customers worldwide.
According to a statement from the company, the annual revenue of the Hewlett Packard Company will be more than $50 billion and "focus on providing uncompetitive integrated technology solutions" for companies.
His garages in Palo Alto split the company called the "Birthplace of the Silicon Valley" and established in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electrical equipment.
HP is reorganizing a major organization to deal with the transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
HP, the world's largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, is one of the latest moves in the industry for the belief that firmly focused firms perform better.
Captain Mikel Arteta says Wilshere was injured before the Dynamo Zagreb match, and his teammates were having problems
Wenger stressed that Wilshere's injury occurred in September and his treatment was planned, and there was no reason not to play during Christmas.
The best-case scenario already means that Wilshere will definitely miss at least four matches in England, and from his past, it is unclear whether he will attend the European Championship next summer.
The most embarrassing thing about the last problem is that after Wilshere had a separate ankle injury, he finished last season strong, and then searched for his old pre-season acuity.
A disability like this is not a threat to your career, Wenger said.
This is a bone that's not fully healed.
It's not a big deal.
It was an accident.
This isn't connected to his wrists or previous injuries.
From a medical perspective, these may be true, but as Wenger will agree, there's a danger of a player returning in mid-season.
There is also a disturbing pattern that develops.
According to a study conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshere had 23 different diseases recorded since the beginning of six years ago.
In the last five seasons, he played only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league matches.
In the big picture, Arsenal is one of the two First Division teams that have often lost due to injury in six out of eight seasons since 2007-08.
Wenger accepts a vicious cycle potential, but Arsenal believes that last season's injury record will continue to improve.
"Sometimes you have a period that is open to injury when you return from an injury, it is a process you want to strengthen your body and win the fight," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to handle this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I trust that, and I believe he'll make his career.
Arsenal, who will begin the Champions League competition against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday night, will play in front of Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, preparing the Wenger team for them.
Héctor Beller'n and Aaron Ramsey didn't go to Croatia, meaning it would be like they were going to play Arteta with Mathieu Debuchy.
Wenger can begin with Nacho Monreal and Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud as replacement for Theo Walcott.
"I try to protect the balance and give the players the breath they need," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is one of the open favorites of Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most reckless stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has been undefeated for 41 matches after producing his own "Namağlup" campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken by a 3.2-strong earthquake on the Richter scale on Tuesday night.
This is the 10th concussion in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal took the necessary lesson from the defeat of Monaco in the Champions League last season, and continues to be motivated by the goal of achieving the first European Cup victory to the club.
"This motivation is gigantic," says Wenger.
Arsenal's never been like this.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I have enough experience to be realistic.
We're passionate, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: comedy program that teaches us serious lessons about men's friendship
The absence of similar ports in the programs is noteworthy; especially at a time when men need more to open up and the suicide rates among young men are at the peak of 15 years.
In 2013, this was the biggest cause of male mortality between the ages of 20-45, and it was three times higher in men than in women.
To draw attention to this problem, the Miserable Campaign (CALM) declared 2015 the Year of Man and aims to oppose the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of the struggle to carry out this challenging task.
A study conducted among high school students with more than 2,000 depressive symptoms showed that if the person suffering from this trouble has a high number of friends in "healthy mode", their chances of recovery have doubled.
Likewise, a circle of mentally healthy friends for non-depressive people halves mental challenges that may arise.
But of course, friendship has to be accessible first to work.
In this era of social media-based communication, it makes urgent responses instead of meaningful communication with the focus on style rather than content.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to look like strong, fun-loving and successful people, even if everything is really in charge of isolation.
Artificial success is spent on internal values - our internal longing for personal development and friendship - under the domination of money, image, social status; these are in pursuit, internal values with deeper effects on our mental health - are spent.
As a billionaire video game creator recently explained, money does not buy more happiness.
The beauty of Friends was turning this focal point upside down.
The characters were defined by their personalities, not by their work, and they were revealed by their interaction with their friends.
The frequent hugs of Joey and Chandler, the moments they watch football in comfortable chairs, Ross's involvement in Rachel, all came from the fact that even though they were in the background of explaining the full feelings of men, they could actually relate to them.
What a helpful employee tells me: "I have seen how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference when listening to depressed and suicidal people."
Most men who contact us can't talk to their friends.
A feeling like "get through and go" is very strong, and so is the idea that opening up to others is a sign of weakness."
One of the programs I thought of when I was proposing long-term coping mechanisms is the Friends series.
He emphasized the little moments of your boyfriend.
In line with my goal, a foreign status on the phone helps people when they're in trouble, but long-term support comes from family and friends with close personal networks.
And if you join FriendsFest in Comedy Central this weekend, why not take your friends to Central Perk for a drink in this beautiful environment where the scenes for the celebration are redesigned?
Or, even better yet, if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You have no idea what difference your friendship will make.
Friends from start to finish at Comedy Central - all 236 episodes - broadcast for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored a goal, making it easier for PSG to defeat Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrated with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring a goal against Malmö.
At the start of the Champions League, Angel Di Maria scored a goal against Sweden's Malmö on Tuesday, making it easier for PSG to beat the opponent.
Here's the match report and the responses to the match.
In the match, Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were targeted, and Paris Saint-Germain began the Champions League match Tuesday with a 2-0 win against Malmö at the Parc des Princes stadium.
Di Maria scored a four-minute goal, making the French champion move in the Champions League, but in the 61st minute, they were unable to take advantage of the opportunities until Cavani's second goal with his head.
Paris, which was with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group A, needed a strong start against the Swedish champion, not only to get out of the qualifying groups, but also to improve their quarter-final performances in the last three championships.
But the game they played when they scored was not the best game of the era for Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic spent a lot of positions around the penalty area, and with him, he was later taken over against the team of his hometown, where he started his glorious career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win whether it's inside the Champions League or out, in this respect, our 2-0 win will cause problems for our opponents, and it's a good start to give a comfortable look behind, even though there are some things we need to improve during the season," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
Even though I regretted that we didn't score one or two more goals, we wanted to win and we won.
Ibrahimovic after injury 1. He returned to Paris in the league, with three major changes in the 2-2 match against Bordeaux in the weekend, but in the fourth minute he was in the shadow of Di Maria.
When the Argentine wingman was transferred from Manchester United last month, he was seen as a player to bring PSG higher in Europe, and on Marco Veratti's pass, he ran behind the Malmö defender and showed that those who thought so were not wrong when he took Johan Wiland from the far corner to the nets.
However, everyone was disappointed while waiting for the PSG to win a great victory.
Malmö, who eliminated Celtic in the playoffs, was lined up with nine international players, a five-man defense and two midfield-deep players, a heavy opponent.
In the 34th minute, Nikola Djurdjic made very few attacks, except for the shot that stripped the pole of the corner guarded by Kevin Trapp.
PSG, on the other hand, gave them the opportunity to slow down the game with unnecessary passes and unproductive last strokes, and in the first half, Ibrahimovic was unable to finish at least five attacks, and when the second half began, he was disappointed by failing to keep up with Cavani's game.
However, when he came to organize his co-workers, he showed that he was more skilled, Ibrahimovic, who gave the pass of the curved stroke Di Maria sent to Wiland's goal in the 52nd minute.
The second goal came thanks to Cavani after a full hour of time, the Uruguayan player scored his sixth goal in the season with Maxwell's left-wing head after Ibrahimovic's pass.
Malmö's reunion of the match was exhausted, and after Ezequiel Lavezzi's unofficial golden, Wiland saved David Luiz's shot in the vacant position perfectly and did not allow the score to change.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was a classy superior to his own team, the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League match was in December of last year."
Since then, we have played ball in the Swedish League, which is not only at the same level as him.
The teams in the qualifiers aren't enough.
A hat is taken off in Paris.
It was a great game for them.
Glencore earns $2.5 billion in stock sales
Glencore, a Swiss-based mining giant, suffered a blow from the price of processed goods and sold its shares on Wednesday, selling its shares on Wednesday, earning $2.5 billion.
Listed in London, Glencore announced that it has sold new shares worth 1.6 billion pounds to pay off its own debt.
The company, which lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, was severely affected by falling goods prices due to China's economic slowdown causing an increase in demand and causing confusion in the markets.
The problem of rights led to Glencore's stock prices rising early Wednesday morning on the London stock market.
The shares opened 0.69 percent higher in the FTSE 100 index, increasing by 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence.

Matt Damon makes the variety of filmmaking seem trivial
Matt Damon opposed African-American filmmaker Effie Brown, saying it was not necessary to be behind the camera during a dispute of diversity.
In the Project Greenlight Sunday night episode, published on HBO, Brown stressed that the project's selected script needs alternative perspectives on the main character, while the experienced actor interrupted.
Damon, when we talk about diversity, you don't do it in the cast of the show, you're in the cast of the film, he claims.

The only black character is a whore shot by a white conversational cord.
Dear White People's publisher insisted on their right to direct the film, the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio. Damon responded that his assignments could "consume as we didn't want."
After the debate was released, there was an explosion of dissatisfaction with Damon's comments on social media.
"Matt Damon speaks on the only black person in the room, so he can explain his diversity about this person as WHITE IS painful," said Twitter user MrPooni.
After the tweet was sent, it received 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments came when the media was at the forefront of the right race expression social debate.
After being killed by a young white police officer named Michael Brown, the Black Life is Important, the movement was effectively encouraged lawmakers and officials to stop discrimination against colored people.
In February, singer Prince spoke of the move with the top closed when the Grammy Awards were the nominees for Album of the Year.
The albums are still important, he said.
Albums such as books and black lives are still important.
Recent leaders of the Black Life is Matting, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, an important figure in Fox News, issued a statement in response to the question of whether the group should be considered a hate group.
Leaders, Black Life Matters The network is a group of love, he said.

The 'American Ninja Warrior' crowned its first champion
Isaac Caldiero, a professional rock climber and busboy, won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night, becoming the first to receive a $1 million prize.
This competition, which entered the 7th season, had never seen a contestant who had been able to complete all stages in the obstacles course.
In the season final, Caldiero and Geoff Britten made their final appearance.
The last mission was to climb a rope of about 20 meters in 30 seconds.
Britten became the first to complete this course in his time, thus becoming the first athlete to complete the American Ninja Warrior's fourth stage, but Caldiero finished the track three seconds before that.
After this difficult win, Caldiero spoke to E!News with the shock of winning the $1 million grand prize.
Isaac told E! a huge raise in his salary and said, "I don't think it's great to think about it, I've never made more than $10,000 a year or I've never made a living."
I mean, it just happened... I can't imagine how it's gonna be... the future is unknown.
Producer Kent Weed also met the final with The Hollywood Reporter, and Britten announced why no awards would be given, although Britten was the first contestant to finish the course.
According to the rules, money is given to the fastest.
"If anyone has more than one finish, the fastest maker will win the prize," Weed said.
Whether money is a great reward and it changes life, it's a big bonus.
I don't think he has any bad thoughts about it.
She's so happy to do what she's done.
He received tons of praise from his fans.
He's a great man and a family man.
A hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff told me, "I'm glad it's Isaac if someone's gonna beat me."
I think Isaac would have thought the same thing if his roles had changed.
The American Ninja Warrior renewed the contract for the eighth season, and the shoots will begin in Spring 2016.

It's hard for the spares to waste every game, so I wanted to dive deep into the game.
Victor Martinez, the Tigers' selected hit, hit three times, and the two of them were running, the first RBI he had won since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-stroke night since the four hits against the Seattle Mariners on the 6th of July.

After Detroit attempted to run to guarantee the ninth, Mauer crossed the RBI and paved the way with the Tigers, making 5-4 approach to Bruce Rondon.
However, he was captured by Sano at three launches for the right-hand fiftyth-five rescue.
Detroit took advantage of the early release of Phil Hughes, who had lost his form.
Tigers have won three runs in their first two rounds against the experienced fifty players who have been out of the field for more than a month due to the back burn.

Xi wants to open the economy more to the world
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with managing reforms that the economy should be opened further to accelerate growth.
To Strengthen General Reforms 16. "China should develop the policies of opening by attracting foreign investment expertise," said the President at the centre-to-Century Group meeting.
As it encourages opening, Xi said, making new reforms will create a new space for economic growth by bringing new energy and vitality.
The leading group adopted a number of proposals, such as the negative list regulating market access, relaxation in border control policies, encouraging the state-owned organisations (SOE) to incorporate private equity, and review of the registration system of residents.
According to the statement, a negative list will be prepared for investment that defines the prohibited sector and business branches.
The system will be tested gradually and developed with trial programs.
This is an important move, because it will play a greater role in allocating resources to the market and will make the market more clear by providing the law-based business environment.
The government will also loosen their control over companies, allowing companies to run their own businesses themselves.
China will also examine new cross-border economic co-operation models in the border regions and new mechanisms will be introduced to promote regional growth, the statement said.
More space to open sectors controlled by the state will be opened to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy for foreign investment, and it will provide better services to foreign funded companies by protecting their interests," the statement said.
In addition, the requirements of foreigners to receive permanent settlement permits or "green cards" will be optimized and the application processes will be facilitated by putting them on a path.
The meeting was also discussed at the meeting to guarantee the rights of lawyers to practice and to train professional judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
Miniature bag now very fashionable newspaper Friday Next
In the fashion world, the roads go back to the bags.
The trend that has come to the attention recently is the miniature ones...
It is also possible to say that the small bags attached to the elders attract attention.
They say the little one of everything is beautiful.
I think that's the point of view, too, for the bags.
When he couldn't get enough of the streets to step on the streets with bags of almost the size of suitcases, the wind suddenly began to blow in the opposite direction, and the bags were inclined to shrink.
There were already small bags, but this time they came up with the shrinking of large sleeve bags.
Only your phone, credit card and key can fit in these tiny bags.
The current, which started with Céline and Hermés, spread with Prada.
The fact that bag admiration turned into miniature curiosity also affected the new models.
Loewe presented the fun bags he had prepared this season in two-size shape.
Panda, the most elephant-looking ones from the polar bear and elephant-shaped bags stand out.
The minis of the big bags offered by luxury brands with phenomenal names again seem to attract the red carpet celebrities the most.
Hermes' "Birkin" bag dedicated to Jane Birkin is one of the most preferred.
Although, Jane Birkin said in a press release that she didn't want her name to be commemorated with a bag, but that's how it's in the memories.
Fashion weeks enabled the massing of the mini-bag current.
And on the podiums, mini-bags stand out.
It's not possible to put them on your arm because they're pretty tiny.
They can be used in their cross-state with their long straps.
But on the podiums, we've seen those long straps wrapped around the wrists of the models.
Fendi is one of those who carries the mini-bag issue to a further point.
He's got a suggestion for those who can't fit in a mini-bag, but can't give up on them.
Friend mini bags to big bags.
How?
By turning the mini bags into bags ornaments that can be attached to their elders.
This presentation, which stands out in the podiums, has quickly recovered on the street.
Let's see what else we'll see!
Skin change in denim
Turkey will compete with world brands in denim.
It now enriches this experience in production with design.
Loft's one of them.
We see that black models, which used to be a few, are now taking their place on the shelves every season.
In the season when blacks went up so much, the denims found their best friend.
Leather parts and leather detailed designs stand out as rebel friendly of denims.
In general, short models with zippers called "motorbike" are on the agenda.
While the strong air of the skin is complemented by black pieces again, the chiffon long blouses, sparkler sweaters provide a stylish appearance of sports.
In the old days, young people wore denims and wanted to get lost in the crowd.
It was thought to save the day.
Now, young people want to carry a piece that emphasizes elegance as well as comfortable.
In this respect, it is possible to say that Loft understands its target audience correctly with the collections and complementary pieces
Small step for "global" for Banksy
The world premiere of the "The Art of Banksy" collection, which brings together the works of the mysterious street artist Banksy, was held in Istanbul.
The exhibition, which is the product of the artist's 15 years of work and where 85 original works come together for the first time, is the first exhibition of the Global Karaköy building.
The first exhibition of mysterious street artist Bansky in Istanbul was opened in Global Karaköy (Rıhtım Street) the previous day.
The world-famous artist, who concealed his identity and used an obscene name, of course, was not present at the opening.
We don't know if he's coming to Istanbul.
But according to Steve Lazaridas, the curator of the exhibition, Bansky is not even aware of this exhibition.
There's no need for permission from him.
Because the old friend Bansky and Lazaridas left after 12 years.
Some of the exhibits were collected from Lazaridas and some of them were collected from collectors.
But Bansky followers have wondered about things.
How would Banksy think about the "The Art of Banksy" exhibition, where 85 works were put together?
For example, how would they take the entrance to the exhibition by ticket (35 TL)? What would he say if he saw the small store at the end of the 800-square-foot gallery?
Would the Red Balloon Girl, Cleaner, Rose, and the world's scarfs, and their works that attract attention to the world's wounds were printed on cloth bags, wallets, necklaces were made?
The fact that an artist with an anarchist spirit who hides his identity is making his exhibition so much consumption material is disappointing for Banksy followers.
It's not Banksy's style.
But you still buy a limited number of tickets before they run out!
The big exhibition "The Art of Banksy" for the small, globalizing world for Banksy can be seen until April.
They are scoundrels, tyrants.
Let the goers dig ditches.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan continued his reaction to the academics who signed the statement.
"These are cruel, they are scoundrels."
Indeed, those who are with the wrongdoers are wrongdoers.
He said, "They have committed the same crime because they are with those who make a massacre."
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who left carnations instead of the explosion in Sultanahmet, said, "I shared our regrets with the German President and the German Chancellor both because of the death of 10 German friends in this region in this action in Sultanahmet Square, which is a square of peace that smells like history and civilization.
I would like to extend my condolences to all the German people first to the families of the deceased."
"Our fight against terrorism will continue with determination," he said.
"I especially condemn and condemn the academics who stand up in the face of all these terrorist incidents and publish a black statement and put their signature under those massacres," Erdogan said.
It doesn't make anyone intellectual to understand who our nation is much more closely, that is, being a professor, an associate professor in front of it.
They're dark people.
They are unjust, and they are the scoundrels.
They committed the same crime because they were with the massacrers.
Where will these blackouts put the three-year-old Mevlüde, who was martyred with his father, in the incident in Sycamore?
How do they fit into their conscience to be on the side of his killers?
I would like to invite all the judicial authorities, the senate of universities, to the office due to these actions that are contrary to our constitution and our laws.
Yesterday, I told him that the steps to be taken should be taken quickly.
Let them do whatever they do there.
Those who want to do politics should make politics in parliament.
But if they can't do it in parliament, let them dig ditches or climb the mountain.
I'm being so clear and so clear.

'I found 26 people looking for two wrestlers'
Mete Gümürhan's second documentary "Young Pehlivans", 66.
It was the first Turkish documentary to be selected for the "Generation Lplus" episode of the Berlin Film Festival (11-21 February).
Gümürhan, who was originally from Edirne but was a production company in the Netherlands, explained why and how he shot the documentary he completed in the summer of 2014.
The documentary "Young Pehlivans" will compete in the "Generation Kplus" section of the Berlin Film Festival, which tells the story of the six boarding school students who aim to be world champions in the field of wrestling.
Young Pehlivans, the first Turkish-made documentary selected for this section, is one of the nominees for the Crystal Bear Award.
Although birth growth is Dutch, a director from Edirne Mete Gümürhan.
He listened to oil wrestling stories from his grandfather in Turkey where he came during summer holidays and watched the competitions.
"There are no only political problems in Turkey."
I wanted to tell the world what else happened in Anatolia.
"For example, wrestling from our horse sports is unfortunately not known," he wants to come together with six directors and prepare a documentary project.
This project will be inconclusive, but one day the news of the magazine he reads on the plane opens the door to another project to Gümürhan.
'We stayed in the sugar factory'
Mete Gümürhan, who traces the article, which mentions two younger brothers, goes to Samsun where the family lives.
The father of the children does not allow shooting for the documentary.
Gümürhan explains how he overcomes this challenge: "I thought what I could do all day.
Because the Ministry of Culture's support could be withdrawn."
The father was talking about a boarding school in Amasya where the kids were going to.
I thought of going there.
While I was looking for two kids, I met 26 kids who were interested in wrestling at school.
We started preparing for the shoot in a week, and we've finished the permits.
We didn't even have a place to stay.
"We stayed in the dormitory of the sugar factory."
The documentary, whose filming was completed in 3 weeks, was the biggest challenge to the director.
"I didn't know what I was going to meet when I was shooting," said Gümürhan, saying that three different languages were spoken on the set where the foreign cinematographer and the voiceman worked.
"They didn't speak Turkish either," he says.
Young Pehlivans focus on the story of six out of 26 child wrestlers.
Baran, raised by his grandfather and has weight problems, Harun, who can't participate in the training because he broke his arm, Beytullah, who has ambitious but health problems, Ümit, the youngest champion Ahmet and Mohammad who holds the group together...
Mete Gümürhan explains that he works with children: "I left them completely natural."
I just tried to use Muhammad everywhere.
I shot at practice for the first week and a half.
My wish was for the kids to pretend there were no cameras.
"Fortunately, they got used to it quickly."
It was a surprise to be elected to Berlin
Mete Gümürhan said that he did not expect the Young Pehlivans to be elected to the Berlin Film Festival. "We had preparations, but it was a surprise that we were elected to Berlin."
Young Pehlivans are not a sports documentary, it's a production that tells children about their struggles and transfers sections from their lives.
"I wanted to highlight stories of children with family problems trying to find identity and coping with their problems," he says.
Support to academicians from the art world
The storm, which broke out following the declaration of the "Academics for Peace Initiative," was taking place until the investigations and detaining academics yesterday, while the statements of support are coming in one after the other.
The first support came from the writers, including many famous names.
The other day, the filmmakers announced their support yesterday.
"As artists working in the field of theatre and stage-earthterial arts, we stand next to this honorable meeting of academicians who call for peace and we declare that we stand by freedom of expression, equality, right to life and unconditional peace."
"We are adding our voices to the call for negotiation and peace of academics with our conscience and all our heart," it was said.
More than 400 filmmakers, including Deniz Türkali, Atilla Özdemiroğlu, Nadir Sarıbacak, Özcan Alper, Serra Yılmaz, Onur Ünlü, Yeşim Ustaoğlu, Pelin Esmer, Tolga Karaçelik, said, "We are with free thought and art.
Without but without, without, "We will not be an accomplice to this crime!"
We are with the Initiative of Academics for Peace."
"We are with the academicians who have been transformed into the target of the lice campaign," said the Association of Cinema Writers (SİYAD).
The Initiative of Academics for Peace called for peace and negotiation with the simultaneous statements they made in Ankara and Istanbul on 11 January, and issued a statement titled "We are not participating in this crime."
In addition to 1128 academics at 89 universities, he also signed theories and books, such as Noam Chomsky, David Harvey, Immanuel Wallerstein, Judith Butler, Etienne Balibar, who had worldwide fame.
President Erdogan and Prime Minister Davutoglu sharply criticised the statement of academics as "support for terrorism" and called on the institutions to "do" their status.
After this call, some universities ended the work of academics, while the prosecutor's office initiated an investigation.
Yesterday, a large number of academics were detained.

Hürrem Sultan's red hair, Beren nose, Justin hair...
Trying to look like celebrities is considered normal to a certain extent, but it is seen as psychological discomfort after the point where it starts to affect life completely.
'Celebrity worship syndrome', a known as 'private worship syndrome', is a new topic that has already become an academic issue in the world and we have just been talking about.
It's normal for ladies to run to salons with famous photos.
But it's important to remember the year 'Hürrem Sultan', where all adolescents walk around with Irish-sister-girls.
In the aesthetic operations of 2015, which we left behind, the 'Beren nose' has already been the news that was leading.
It's not that different on the gentlemen's front.
At one point, dressing like Polat Alemdar was a vow.
Now the other one's the other one, the other way, it's scorching.
The Justin Bieber copy is overflowing with young men.
So much so that the unnecessary information we quoted has been read thousands of times on the Internet: "First, when you go to the barber, take the side of your hair, the ears and the surroundings, to the upper ear and the top of your head."
The only side will be short.
After the cutting process is finished, you should shape your hair with light water.
Fix your hair with the help of spray after the forming process is finished.
"Justin must shape the hair when it is damp."
All of this, which has already become an academic issue in the world, brings to mind the newly spoken 'Celebrity worship syndrome', a known other 'private worship syndrome'.
The fans of celebrities are seen as a ball of love.
Artists boast of their fan numbers, how much they influence them.
Fortunately, psychology doesn't see that simple.
In particular, it is debated that adolescents decide according to celebrities what they eat and drink, what to listen to, what to wear.
Excessive commitment to insurmountable names, taking role models is defined as mental discomfort.
Specialist psychologist Sumeyye Demir admits that Turkey is behind in the studies in this field.
However, it does not miss the fact that families are gradually conscious: "One of the main issues of psychology is that one is that one is at peace with oneself, that he is at peace with himself, that he has peace within his own identity."
It wasn't taken very seriously for the children to fill their room with posters, to disguise themselves as someone.
Now it's changing.
His parents feel the need to intervene.
"Responsive devotion to someone is a sign that something goes wrong in the young man's life."
Fans riding the emotional roller coaster
Interest in celebrities is safe, provided you don't overdo it.
He recommends paying attention to symptoms such as not asking his marriage, being jealous of his wife, preferring his clothing.
We're talking about the name of the famous people.
To wonder for them, to be related to their lives, to be considered to be normal.
But when the expert psychologist agrees, the young people who missed the scale of the scale are in the majority: "When there are no names to represent the child in the family or the environment, the gap is filled when there are no names to represent the child in the point of good behavior."
There aren't always good examples.
"He's copying the negatives, too, boy."
When we consult on how to approach them, Sumeyye Demir begins the promise by reminding the fame that passion syndrome is more of adolescence.
Considering that adolescents may be self-insecure, the problem is more comfortable.
On the one hand, we are complaining about the limitations of their families, while on the other hand, we are faced with young people who are waiting for support and compassion: "We are obliged to consider their emotional ups and downs."
New research suggests that they are struggling with the changes in their brains.
"It should be natural and softly approached by the young man who is riding an emotional roller coaster with passion."
It is possible to change behavior
Sumeyye Demir, an expert psychologist, reminds the fame of the parent's duties to overcome the temple syndrome:
Recogniz his emotional distress, make sure you are calm before you get into the matter.
Never let him suppress your emotions.
State that you respect his admiration to encourage independence.
Instead of teaching by scolding, show a good example, discuss names that will be role model for him.
Try to take the place of celebrities in our daily lives together.
It will work to read the books together about the real world of fame.
Make your communication a form of adult adults.
Remember that addiction and motivation use the same ways in the brain.
Share with your child that mistakes are an opportunity for change, accept him as he is.
Be sure to get expert support for fanship.
He's fascinated by the envious of the envious
The basis of fame worship syndrome is the need to expect and seek help from someone else.
Love that can't be blocked is actually a call for help.
Unfortunately, it's not perceived like that.
Moreover, this problem is so common that it is impossible to limit it to a country or continent.
Dr. Recai Yahyaoğlu points out that there are certain names in every country that occupy the television.
The syndrome is more manifested by attachment to these celebrities: "They are unusual."
The general majority do not have their means.
Those who possess will not live like they.
Either they don't embrace it or they don't dare.
"But he continues to watch with those who are not able to, and with anger that cannot live like them."
There's no difference in those who envy or froze and froze.
Both of them are admiring from the inside.
They make money effortless, they're on the agenda of the magazine.
Even knowing that is enough to increase the fanship.
Another recommendation of Specialist Psychologist Sumeyye Demir is to question the reality of those lives at this point.
It should not be overlooked that there are artificial lives.
The support of the environment comes into play for the person who is passionate about fame.
But the person insists that the celebrity he is a fan has problems like him.

Should I have gallbladder surgery? - Family - Health News - Zaman Newspaper
Dr. Fevzi Özgönül answers the questions in his column in Meydan Newspaper..
There's a stone in my gallbladder, and every morning, when I wake up, I go to the bathroom two or more times a day with abdominal pain after meals.
Could that be preventing me from losing weight?
I'm starting to use alkalen right now, but I don't want to eat, I can't lose any weight.
It's been like this since I was a kid.
What should I do?
Do you think I should have gallbladder surgery?
ANSWER: Gallbladder stone is often accompanied by an infection.
These abdominal pain complaints that develop immediately after eating are also a sign that you contract the gallbladder and empty the inflamed bile into the intestines.
The intestines, which are disturbed by the inflamed bile, quickly try to expel this bile.
That's why you go to the bathroom a lot.
And since you go to the bathroom often, what you eat is thrown away before it's digested, and it's slow to lose weight.
I think you need to get this condition treated.
If you go to a gastroentologist specialist and the situation I'm saying is detected, you can get rid of this situation by using antibiotics.
But eventually you may have to have gallbladder surgery.
Alkalen probiotics may reduce your complaints a little bit, but they don't.
Whatever happens, I say keep using the alkalen probiotic.
Because this probiotic powder is the biggest help for your slimming.
I eat a lot when I'm stressed
My teacher, when I'm stressed and nervous, I put myself into food and gain weight.
How can I deal with that?
ANSWER: Excessive food actually means that the energy need cannot be fully met.
This may be due to being low-eat or skiping morning and lunch.
Another reason is that you can not digest the nutrients you eat.
For this, your digestive system needs to work healthy.
If you do not have ulcers, reflux or similar problems, the easiest way is to use a good probiotic drug.
You'll see a lot of it.
I can't gain weight, doctors don't know why
You've got information about weakening in your corner.
It all makes sense to me, but I'm a little different.
I can't get any weight.
And most importantly, I don't know why.
The doctors don't say anything.
ANSWER: The techniques we apply are not only for weakening, but also to return the physiological function of the body to their ideal dimensions.
Weakness with obesity is the same kind of ailment.
It's treated with the same technique that we can't lose weight in a bone weight and weight.
You too are weaker when you eat sweet and pastry foods.
I suppose you've got that figured out by now.
It is also possible to be stimulated by carboxypuncture and gain weight with healthy nutrition.
So you've weakened your ideal body.
Our other patients got fattened from their ideal bodies.
You will reach your ideal body by gaining weight, and they will reach your weight.
If the system problem disappears, you gain weight, they lose weight.
But first, the system needs to work properly.

The boy who feels worthless gets stuck in 'hate'
There are some feelings of birth in the world of feeling.
Fear, sadness, happiness, surprise, anger, anxiety...
But feelings such as hatred, hatred, vengeance arise over time in children and as a result of some wrong attitudes.
Every person needs to be an individual, including childhood.
So let the parent or the social environment respect their decisions, ask the idea about the issues that concern him, and make him feel valuable.
Providing them is the basis of a healthy personality structure.
For example, behaviors such as decision-making (what to wear, what to eat), and to resist the children's own truths instead (shorage the child who wants to go to a football course to the instrumental course) mean not respect the child's personality.
The defense mechanism reveals anger and hatred to protect him because the child, whose self and his existence has lost his freedom of being [own".
"Because anger and hatred are the opposite of accepting anger and hatred," says psychologist Hilal Arslan, who says that the child does not accept what is done to him by hating, but that he is valuable, he is trying to tell him and his surroundings.
"The hatred here means 'I am in, the child's respect for him, he serves his purpose to maintain his respect for him," he said, noting that the child's reaction in this way is a positive development in terms of personality development.
"If the child is allowed to become an individual, hatred will be eliminated," he says.
The child seeks to protect his own self by taking refuge in anger and hatred
At a young age, both physically and spiritually, Arslan said that exposure of children to verbal and emotional violence by the parents, by their environment can cause negative emotions in the child, and he says that with negligence, the child's presence is not noticed and that he is invisible will make the child feel invisible.
"This can sometimes be not only to be met for emotionally (not to caress about your hair, not to hug and kiss, not to take care of school or other needs), and sometimes not to meet their physical needs (such as food, drinking, shelter, school needs, etc.)."
It's a foster attitude that opens up to anger.
In emotional and verbal violence, there are acts such as insulting, insulting, understudy, scolding, giving unnecessary and severe punishments, feeling worthlessness, shouting.
These behaviors touch a deep place because they are aimed at the child's personality.
"The child either loses his self-respect by accepting them and spends his life in a state of carelessness, unlovable, unworthy and inadequate, or tries to protect himself by taking refuge in anger and hatred."
His teacher gave Boyko to Beşiktaş!
Dnipro, which Beşiktaş wants to take two footballers, is preparing for the second half in Antalya Belek.

Markevych, who praised the national net keeper, said, "If two clubs agree, Boyko go to Beşiktaş and make him the champion, I will be happy."
Referring to the situation of the 1990-born Brazilian stopper Douglas Silva Bacelar, whom President Fikret Orman and his staff were planning to transfer, the 64-year-old trainer noted that his student Stuttgart from the Bundesliga was also interested.
Meanwhile, the details of the official offer from River Plate were revealed to Argentine player Jose Sosa of the Black and Whites.
The club's president, Rodolfo D'Onofrio, announced that they offered $2 million for the experienced midfield, but that Beşiktaş wanted $9 million.

Denizlispor President Mustafa Şavluk said that they would move it to the Constitutional Court because the decision of the Arbitration Board was final.
Shavluk, "Judicial path is now exhausted."

Attacks on journalists in Turkey become ordinary
Prior to Prime Minister Davutoglu's visit to London next week, 25 famous writers sent a joint Turkish letter to British Prime Minister Cameron.
During his meeting with Davutoglu, the PEN writers asked Cameron to bring up the decline in press and freedom of expression in Turkey.
Britain's leading writers sent a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron, asking his counterpart, Ahmet Davutoglu, to bring up a decline in Turkey on the issues of press and freedom of expression during his visit to London next week.
25 writers, including the presidents of the International Writers' Union (PEN) in England, Wales and Scotland, expressed their serious concerns in the letter about "unprecedented pressures on freedom of expression in Turkey."
The authors, who stated that threats and physical attacks on journalists, writers and publishers have become ordinary now, have mentioned the attack on Hurriyet Newspaper offices, the raid on the Koza İpek Media Group and the seizure of the confiscation.
In the letter of PEN writers, including Tom Stoppard, Ali Smith and Ian Rankin, as well as Elif Şafak, three journalists working for the Vice News institution were arrested, sued for other journalists, and arrests against journalists continued.
"It is vital for journalists in Turkey to perform their primary duties in the society, allowing them to inform the public without being censored," the authors said, stating that the arrest of Can Dündar and Erdem Gül in the case of the MIT trucks also caused concerns.
Attacks on journalists, writers and publishers have eroded the freedoms of the entire Turkish community, he said.
He stated that journalists and writers were subjected to intimidation methods up to physical attacks due to widespread "untreatment culture."
The authors noted that the number of Turkish citizens sued on the charge of "insulting the president" has increased, and after Erdogan was elected in 2014, he filed more insults than he has sued for all of his predecessors.
Davutoğlu's words are stuck
Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who will visit London next week, is one of the few members of the government who expressed his support for press freedom, while these statements were not turned into action, he said.
"For this reason, Davutoğlu's visit to London poses an important opportunity for a clear commitment to freedom of expression in Turkey," the letter said.
The authors asked Cameron to call on Prime Minister Davutoglu to ensure that his government respects Turkey's obligations on freedom of expression.
25 authors with signatures in the letter:
Monica Ali, Alan Bissett, William Boyd, Chris Brookmyre, Gillian Clarke, Drew Campbell (Psychya PEN President), Fflur Dafydd, Stevie Davies, Menna Elfyn (Head of Giler PEN), Moris Farhi, Maureen Freely (England PEN President), Richard Gwyn, Mark Haddon, David Hare, Eva Hoffman, Hari Kunzru, Robert Minhinnick, Blake Morrison, Neel Mukherjee, Ian Rankin, ElShazzy, Owen Sheers, Ali Smith, Tom Stoppard, Sarah Waters.
