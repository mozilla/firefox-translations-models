The main objective of science is to reveal how the world is to process scientifically. This method actually leads to most scientific research.
But experiments are not alone. The experiment is a test used to criticize one or more from possible hypotheses, ask questions, observing also guides scientific research.
Nature scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle’s soul science has accepted blood on all science topics.
Unlike Greek, Western, Greek philosophical and scientific roots were broken.
Many rhythms observed in physiological and movements depend mostly on the presence of critical internal cycles and the production of these cycles through biological watches.
Not only respond to external periodical tips, periodic rhythms, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals are documented in most live assets.
Biological watches are oscillators that continue a free cycle period even in the absence of signs from outside.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading recommendations that DNA is a genetic substance.
Hershey and Chase benefited from faj and viruses to place their DNA with a method of implantation to a bacteria.
They made 2 experiments by marking DNA or radioactive phage or radioactive ductile portein fragment.
Mutations can have a lot of different effects, according to the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material part, and whether the affected cells are germ line cells.

Every morning, people to go to their workplaces are separated from the small towns of the rock, and they pass from other employees to the place where they leave themselves a little before to go to their workplaces.
Anyone in these dynamic mutual transportation flights is connected to a transportation system based on private cars and supports it.
Science shows that this massive carbon economy disrupts stable biosphere status, which supports human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone uses a part of the society and transportation systems. Almost everyone complains of transportation systems.
In advanced countries you rarely hear complaints such as water quality or crash of bridges.
Why transport systems take complaints to such, why they fail on the basis of the day? Are transportation engineers unqualified? Or have a more basic problem?
Traffic Flow is the research of interactions between individual drivers and two points of vehicles and each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to work on traffic flow because the drive behavior can not be predicted by percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act in a stable range in reasonable time, so traffic flows tend to have a acceptable consistency and can be expected as roughly mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relations between three main features are determined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help planning, design and operation of road facilities.
The first animals managed to fly insects. Aircraft capabilities helped them get easier than enemies, find food and wives easier.
Most insects have the advantage of putting their wings back throughout their body.

All of them were discovered in nature with their main state, and since the first age, people have knowledge about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since they could be relatively simple to get out with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theory that everything consists of a mixture of four elements or more. These were soil, water, air and fire.
This is rather like four versions of the substance (in turn): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. However, they also woke up to new ingredients to get the formats we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.

In general, two behaviors may occur when managers begin to dispatch and manage their former colleagues. One side of Yelpazenin is to work in the form of "one of men" (or one of the girls).
These types of managers have difficulty in making decisions that do not like the majority, taking discipline measures, performing evaluations, responsibilities and keeping people responsible.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person will change everything he did and turn into an unfamiliar one who thinks he should do.
The leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often causes disputes between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence with traditional teams but there are fine differences.
Virtual team members often serve the person to be consulted for their close physical groups.
Virtual teams can meet according to changing time zones that may not be understood by local administrations, often they have more autonomy than traditional team members.
The presence of a real “visible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, s.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team that each member reports. Invisible team determines standards for each member.
Why do a organization want to switch from the consumer process when building a learning organization? A goal to implement organizational learning concepts is development.
All the possible resources in the functional departments of an organization can occur in an effective way.
As a result, the process of an organization that has been worked together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that will serve customers’ requirements.

The intestine between brain pathology and behavior supports science people in research.
Different brain damage is known for a long time that trauma affects the behavior of lesion and tumor types and causes changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and research unprecedented brain structures and processes before.
This gives us many information and material support to design simulation models that help us solve the functioning of our mind.
Although AI has a strong call with science fiction, AI creates a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and smart adaptation in a machine.
Artificial intelligence research involves developing robots that will automate tasks requiring smart behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, response to customer diagnosis and questions; handwriting, voice and facial recognition skills.
Each of these skills has become separate disciplines focused on providing solutions to the problems of real life.
Artificial intelligence systems are now often used in economies, medicine, engineering and military fields as they are in home computers and video gaming software.

For example, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website related to their trips to the State Capital every year, each year the website is reorganized, but the old versions are kept online to be used as a notebook.
Also blogs can help students improve typing. Students’ blog experiences often start with careless grammar and typos, the presence of a reader’s audience often changes it.
The most critical audience often tries to develop the article to avoid criticism of bloggers because they are students.
Writing a blog "people are forced to be more conscious about the world around them." The need to feed followers inspire students to be smart and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blog writing is a tool that encourages students to learn, move beyond traditional school curriculum.
The proper use of blogs can ensure that students are more analytical and critical; students can identify their positions in the context of others’ writings by actively reacting to internet materials and their perspectives on certain topics (Oravec, 2002).
