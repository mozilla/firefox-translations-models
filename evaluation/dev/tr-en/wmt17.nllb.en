Ashçı, 28, is a 28-year-old male who is living in the San Francisco Mall.
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a local shopping mall's stairwell this week.
But the victim's brother, noting that he did not think it was possible that someone might want to hurt him, said: "So things were going well for him".
The San Francisco Adli Medical Center, which was located in the Westfield Shopping Mall on Wednesday morning, said it was determined that the 28-year-old San Francisco resident was Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco Emniyet Directorate of Public Safety said the cause of death was determined to be a homicide and that the investigation was ongoing.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia, formerly the head of the Boston kitchen department at ABC station KGO in San Francisco, Frank'in, said he had started working as the head of the kitchen department at San Francisco Sons & Daughters six months earlier after getting a job at his dream home.
Sons & Daughters said the death "has left them very sad and deeply saddened".
Sözcü, "Burada is a small team that works like a close family and will be very much missed", he explained.
In this difficult time, we would like to point out to the Frank'in family that they are not alone and that our prayers are with them.
Louis Galicia, Frank'in initially noted that he stayed in the hostel and said "Sonunda things were going well for him".
Louis Galicia, KGO'ya, said "A circle was closed and a girl was coming out".
Louis Galicia said he never thought it was possible that his younger brother might be a sheep who wanted to harm him.
He was a great man, a heart-shaped man, a Nazi.
The way to get to the Ailetryle is always to make us a cigarette, cook us", said Louis Galicia.
Müntrakaşaya was not happy with the move.
My brother, hertruma was a fit.
"The rest of the world is just going to hell, and every day is just going to shine", he said.
The number of phone numbers 415-575-4444 of the persons with the information was requested to contact SFPD İhbar Hattını.
Assistant Doctors in the Army: New calls for work slowing down.
The Assistant Doctors' Representatives asked their unions to allow them to slow down work due to a dispute over a new contract.
The General Council of the British Medical Association's (BMA) Assistant Doctoral Committee (JDC) has called for further work-stopping eylemini support since early September.
The JDC said the bankers' concerns about the contract could not be addressed.
Assistant doctors and medical students were used in a contractual arrangement with the BMA.
This was rejected by 58% of voters.
In a tweet posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC President Ellen McCourt said the government was "out of touch" with the issues that led to the contract being cancelled.
Kendricks said: "In light of this, the JDC Governing Council voted to completely rescind the proposed new contract and called for a formal resumption of negotiations on the concerns".
In response to the government's resignation, the JDC administration has formally requested the BMA Board to allow a program to slow down the work from the beginning of September.
The dispute led to the first-ever one-day strike of six doctors' assistants in NHS history this year.
BMA's assistant chief medical officer, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after being granted the terms of the BMA's proposed contract.
During the pre-voting meetings of the 54,000 physician assistants and medical students, he told the BMA members that this was a good deal that should be accepted.
Following the hearing, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be implemented in a way that would apply to doctors in the UK.
Russia and Turkey: Is it a 'trumsuzlar ittifakı'?
Bu, the crisis is sounding like a bust.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey, on Tuesday, met to announce the official signing of the eight-month war, which has been waged with clampdowns and verbal and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted Türk mevkidaşini in the lavish salon of the St. Petersburg Sarayı, I was surprised to learn that Ankara was the party most eager to reach this agreement.
Eltr got stuck, yes.
But Mr. Putin's smile was rather weak and could not be said to have spread any warmth against his own restricted standards.
Aksine, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, repeatedly mentioned "this friend" Mr. Putin; according to one report, five times.
I surprised Bentr's master.
Kennedy also promised that relations with Russia would not go back to pre-crisis levels, but to much higher levels.
The next day, a local newspaper reported that Mr. Erdoğan acted as if nothing bad had happened.
I think his enthusiasm was the opposite.
But Mr. Putin's cold-hearted verdict showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement was the cause of the crisis: Turkey's downing of a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
At that time, Russia's verdict was in full swing.
Mr. Putin, making a sharp statement, accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The anger was much greater, and the opposing party was considered a friend.
The reconstruction of Güventrin in the true sense of the word will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Since November, the Russian public's opinion has changed.
State-controlled media have repeatedly targeted Ankara in a harsh and aggressive manner.
Antriden, her thing is the culprit Türkler.
Among the most serious of these were allegations by senior officials that Mr. Erdogan's family was profiting from the illegal oil trade in areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
Kendisi has definitely given it up.
However, an official message from St. Petersburg said it was time to move on.
After all, the reason this meeting took place was that Mr. Putin had apologized to President Erdoğan.
Russia can see this as a kind of triumph.
The results of the ceasefire call for Ankara are very clear.
First, he needed a second push after Erdoğan's failed coup last month that nearly toppled him.
The recent terrorist attacks in Turkey have left him very much in awe.
It is also an economically viable alternative to efficient transport.
Russia's sanctions are very severe; in particular, the ban on private flights carrying several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coastal areas each year.
This figure dropped by almost 90 percent.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies were definitely relieved that flights would continue.
They are now in the grip of the season-ending intensity in Aktreniz.
Also this week, state television, Turk agrim, predicted that the import of agricultural products would be allowed again and that the prices of fruits and vegetables would rise.
If we quote from Vedtremosti newspaper, "Tourists there, domatesler here".
But the visit has a different political value for Moscow.
Ankara, Batı'ya is angry that the reaction to the coup attempt was not enough.
As long-standing anger and anger erupted over the rapid progress of US accession talks, Mr Putin, who wants to take advantage of Turkey's ties with the West and the cold in between, is turning to the devreye.
The Russian leader seems to have definitely gained sympathy from Ankara for the call for support from elected officials following the coup attempt.
It must be remembered that for Moscow, which has a deep fear of regime change, this is an inevitable situation.
This summit, held in the boisterous palaces near Deniz, represents a "uyumsuzlar alliance" as one analyst describes it: combining the forces of the two countries, which Batı has rejected and which he has misbehaved.
Despite the contrasting appearance of the two exhibitors, they are quite different from each other.
One of the most important of these is the confrontation between Moscow and Turkey over Syria: Moscow has shown itself to be a terrorist organization, and Russia and Turkey have opposed it.
After nearly three hours of initial talks, the two presidents said that the issue had not been discussed at the press conference, but this was confirmed.
While Turkey's President, who has avoided publicly answering any questions about these differences, Putin chose to ignore them.
There is no clear consensus on how to determine the common ground of Suriye'de.
But after months of openly persistent hostility - and given the absolute disaster potential of NATO member Turkey's downing of a Russian fighter jet - it is certainly a good development for the two leaders to at least start a conversation.
The Bank of Scotland is disappearing for customers outside Scotland.
According to the statement of the chairman of the bank's board, the headquarters of RBS will be moved to the position of the office of the bank.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be defunct for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan, BBC Scotland's RBS brand, said the bank's global goals were linked.
Six years ago, almost his batma status was reduced to a standstill, and he was forced to withdraw and give up.
During this time, brand strategists used 'RBS' to protect other consumer financial brands.
This has been supported by millions of pounds for many sponsorships, from the Six Nations Rugby Championship to the Wimbledon Andy Murray Championship.
But now it has been decided that it would be more accurate to lead the ulcerated marks.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by customers of the Bank of Scotland, but no new start-ups will be made.
All RBS-owned shares, except those of the UK and Galler's central and exchange, will be renamed NatWest.
Ulster Bank's brand is currently used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Bireysel Banking has a much more demanding role to play than smaller brands; Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
A bullshit interview was held for customers and staff at Bay McEwan, Invertrness-shire.
"We will be a bank with more brands, and RBS' brand will no longer be a brand where our investors and staff are employed", he told BBC Scotland.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying that we no longer have global targets, but local ones.
Each of these brands will be presented in a slightly different way in the community in which they are found, and our staff will work under the name of customers and brands.
RBS had announced that it would no longer sponsor the Six Nations Championship and that it was raising the profile of different brands in terms of sports sponsorship.
The president of the executive board said, "Now it's time to transition to the concept of a brokerage bank because (we were asking ourselves) how can we make this a better bank for our customers?"
Three years ago we stated that we would be a great bank for our customers and would name these brands alayvari bultrurdum.
But I think you will see a lot of change in the work we do and the focus we put on the needs of our customers, not ourselves.
We can re-develop these brands, so I think this is the right time.
Frankie Dettori, Prediletration and Newmarket won the award 3000 times.
After reaching 3000. zaferine with the couple's success at Newmarket, Dettori, the champagne patlattı.
Joker Frankie Dettori, on Friday at Newmarket, won the 3000. zaferini in England.
On the track, John Gosden's coach, Predilection, reached that milestone by winning the second race.
The 45-year-old Italian Engeltrsiz became the sixth jockey to reach that mile.
Kendisi is following in the footsteps of Sör Gordon Richtrards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
"This is a special situation", said the jockey, who had previously won three championships with Ghayyar'da Dafeer.
I was so moved by the fact that we were here.
I'm really happy that this is the Newmarket I started 30 years ago.
This is not a big meeting, not a Royal Ascot - just 20,000 people and a regular Friday night.
I feel at ease and relaxed.
Dettori, after the victory, accepted the offerings by bringing the Predilection.
England ran the mile and reached two jokers: champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired jockey Sör Anthony McCoy, a 20-time champion with career records of over 4,300 wins.
The Derby race was won nine times by Lester Piggott, who in his career has 4493 wins.
Frankie, one of the best jokers of our time, and it's no surprise that only a few people have walked a mile before him.
He is a man of talent and strength, but he has a tactical mindset that makes him a heavyweight.
Kendisi at the race represents her in an extraordinary way, with her excitement and charisma and the people who have been attracted to this sport.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie at Epsom that if there wasn't one jockey racing only on weekends and in major races, he might have reached 6,000 wins.
Frankly, Frankie has spent most of his 30 years racing in the UK with great success, and it's great to see that.
Kendisi has a rather exciting character and is a very good feature for these British races but beyond that he is an outstanding jockey.
Frankie Dettori, who had been a rock-climber, had been playing a harem with a knife.
From the races he finished to the jumps he made to the jumps he made, Frankie Dettori, a multi-movement man, became a symbol of British unattached racing for twenty years.
This is a cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold.
In 1996, the famous Ascot 'Büyük Yedili' saferini containing many great races was won along with surviving a plane crash and was banned for failing to comply with the drug ban.
During his six-month retreat from the six-month process three years ago, he first struggled to clear himself of his suspects and showed that he had a strong character to get better.
And it could go on for a while longer; Dettori had previously expressed his desire to continue competing until at least age 50.
Russian President Putin has taken office as the special envoy of Sergei Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, the special envoy of Sergei Ivanov, was unexpectedly sworn in.
Mr. Ivanov was for many years a part of Mr. Putin's close circle of trust.
The 63-year-old, now assigned as a special representative for environmental and transportation issues.
In a separate statement from the Kremlin, Putin's "judgment against Ivanov in his role as head of the Russian administration" was stated, but no reason was given.
Anton Vaino, who has been deputy since 2012, was appointed to this position by Ivantrov.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, he graduated from the Moscow State Institute for International Affairs (MGIMO) and served in the Embassy of Tokyo.
Later the presidential protocol and the administration of government personnel were taken care of; ifadeler bu şekildedir (Rusça) on the Kremlin website.
After his visit, he told Putin: "Thank you for trusting me".
I think that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in the formulation of laws and the enforcement of directives.
Mr. Putin on Friday announced to the Russian TV channel that he wanted Mr. Ivanov to step down and that he had proposed Mr. Vaino'yu to take his place.
What is the meaning of the word "gollum"?
This is a hamle that has been hacking Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was a longtime close ally of Vladimir Putin and had served in the KGB, the Soviet security forces, like himself.
Especially stylishly, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin that was broadcast on state television, both specialists said they had voluntarily resigned.
But despite the smiling poses given to the cameras, very few people here are convinced of this; especially in this period when parliamentary elections are approaching.
But is this a conflict arising from a kind of learning struggle?
No one knows about it yet.
However, the official statement that one potential president suddenly refused to direct Russia's environmental policy was met with great suspicion.
According to a quotation on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivantrov addressed Mr Putin as follows: "In a conversation we had at the beginning of 2012 it was true that I asked you to confide in me for four years for this difficult - even problematic - task.
Well, apparently I served as the president's special adviser for four years, eight months.
Mr. Ivanov, December 2011'de was appointed to this position.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
Kendisi is a former member of the KGB state security forces, as well as a member of the Russian Security Council and Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, Mr Putin took over as head of the Federal Security Forces (FSB), replacing the KGB, and Mr Ivanov appointed him.
When Putin took office, Ivanov was portrayed as a five-man sheep he trusted.
Since Mr. Putin's third term as president was unconstitutional, Mr. Ivanov thought Mr. Putin could become president after his second term.
However, this task was delegated to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr. Putin, who was prime minister before returning to the presidency three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson, the producer, was fired after being shot.
Gibson, last week, a disaster struck a physical breakdown in his Los Angeles apartment.
Disney's production team, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced in a joint statement that he had been fired.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology on Tuesday before the announcement of the termination.
There are differences and differences in the seven creative conulars.
Bir beyanda said "I am sorry that such an incident happened".
In a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character will be removed from a program following a group of FBI agents were released at a later date.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, had been a part of the show since its first season in 2005.
Gibson said in a statement released Friday: "I love Criminal Minds and I have worked with it with my heart and soul for the past ten years".
I would like to be quiet until the end of the day, but that is no longer possible.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, the great team and most importantly, the best supporters a program can have.
The show is expected to return to the screen on September 28th for a second season.
The mystery of the fish in Bantrff's garden
A resident of Bantrff has requested help identifying the fish that appeared in Banff'taki's garden.
Kevin Bain, the author of 75 fish, thinks that these may be sea turtles.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from Denizden, published images on Periscope showing the two-inch-long fishes appearing in the bay.
Queensferry Bridge: The bridge is now connected to Fife.
The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineer Queensferry Geçidinin connected the northern and northern part of the bridge; this means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four closures between the "table fans" that are about to be completed around each of the bridge's three towers.
The bridge's pier from Fife is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 support cables.
The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown, today, visited the thesis site and became one of the first people to walk on the bridge.
He said: "Bu, the Queensferry Bridge was built in a historic and symbolic year.
With this project, which uses over 30,000 tons of concrete to build just this section of the Hepimiz Bridge, we are witnessing engineering on a truly landmark scale.
Despite the exceptional size and weight of the bridge, the gap between the viaduct and the bridge table is very narrow and requires a lot of hard work to achieve this fit.
In general, almost 79% of the total bridge table is installed, meaning that the concrete pouring of the first few pieces of the table will be done today in Rosyth, and the entire table will be ready to be lifted on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project director of Forth Geçit ve Kötr Köprü Müteahhitleri, said: "In the construction of the entire bridge, the first closure is always an important milestone.
This remarkable project, this closure, represents a pioneering work in civil engineering.
After the placement of the railway board and the connection to the expanding North Tower level, we had to close the gap on the north side.
This was accomplished by pulling the sun up to 700 millimeters from the northern horizon.
It's a very large but also very difficult process.
The reason for its size is that the 222-meter-long, nearly 6,000-tonne-long, and about 3% slope-demanding watermelon is needed.
The reason for the Hassas was that the tolerance values the team had to meet were too low; both sides were only a few millimeters wide.
Netryse ki her thing went well.
Moelfre Bay rescue sin: Three men 'lucky to have survived'
Three men, after being shot by enemy anglers from Anglesey's fishing fleet, were "lucky to have survived".
Moelfre RNLI ctrankurtaran filikası stations, tertibatın Moelfre Bay's after the holiday break on Friday, English summer time at 13:20'de alarm verdi.
Three men, technicians, were swimming their way through the water to a safe area while continuing their journey.
"We saw the drawing of the drawers towards them and we caught the signal", said the control officer of the Moelfre cankurtarantr office.
"But we were driven away by strong winds until we went their way", he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local balıktrıçı technician, while the third man, 60, was found lying in a tiring position without a can yeleği.
Hepsi was taken to the cankurtaran barracks on the way to the coast and the cankurtaran barracks were brought to the station.
Bay Jones said: "Three men who fell in love were lucky to survive and never have children.
There was a cable but when the technology was in use, the user had to be somehow disconnected.
Today, these three men are being stalked by a mob.
Pokémon Go, a valuable developmental device for health and happiness, is a popular game.
It's really amazing to see how the world is changing.
The fact that Gentrçler and the children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time on screens, has been a situation that has saddened most people over the past decade.
Pokemon Go encourages people to move around with a calf.
The era of the digital revolution, when television was limited to video games, was then extended to the likes of video games and smartphones.
It is therefore really wonderful to see that technology and open-air movement are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, I'm talking about Pokémon Go, a character-based app that was originally created for a video game in the 90s (later turned into a comic strip, playing cards, and other side products).
Like many other popular culture genres, this new game was a hit when it was released in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Later, the sunset in other countries was delayed due to intense interest in the overloading of servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go reached more users than Tinder and almost the same number as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In short, gamers can pick up their smartphones, tracked by GPS, and Pokémon go out into the wild, 'taking pictures' of their bulldogs or 'catching them'.
A generation of younger players who were looking for a game took the plunge into this madness.
In the United States, the "traffic" has led to a significant increase in the number of steps a person takes each day.
Cardiogram, an app developed for the Apple Watch and followed by 35,000 users, recently reported that the percentage of people who exercised 30 days a day rose from 45 percent to 53 percent among those who followed in the two days after the Washington Post game was released.
The company doesn't know that Kimler plays Pokémon Go; only exercise-level ham verils can be seen.
Most public health campaigns that encouraged people to "take 30 minutes off", "keep their mouths shut", and "be active every day" were ignored because most public health messages were boring and sent by seemingly unstable people.
But again, it's important to exercise and stress.
People who exercise regularly are more likely to develop cancer or depression.
It provides consular assistance such as exercise, weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes, and has a list of advantages that is too long to list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go'nun is that it takes people out to do something they enjoy.
In this way, the three basic elements of health are met: movement, clean air, and sunlight and entertainment.
Some people have new friends during their time of marriage.
As usual, there is nothing to complain about among the unscripted gamers.
And of course someone walking can hit the door.
What difference does it make?
Big bir recently sunned.
Smartphone apps like Fittrbit have given us no reason to exercise like this game.
The effect of the new will pass and the use will decrease over time.
But due to Pokémon's success, many games will be released that help the outgoing individuals become more active, fit and healthy by combining applications and santral reality with real-world activities.

Simone Biles, female gymnast, won the gold medal in the overall gymnastics category.
Forget about the Basque Country.
Don't forget about the heyecan.
Simone Biles has a complete immunity to all forms of cancer.
Dynamic with respect to Attrlama.
Dtrenge is a bit of a mess.
The earth is amazing.
From top to bottom perfection.
He is now an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast finished first overall in the Olympics on Thursday and clearly distinguished himself from the rest of the world.
The 62,198 points he scored in the final were far above the silver medalist and son of five team-mate Aly Raisman and the bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina of Russia.
Simone Biles, from the United States, performed sergiled in the denge aletinde performance at the final of the women's artistic gymnastics general event at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics in Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American woman to receive the award and the fifth overall, and she made a name for herself as the best woman of her generation and perhaps of all time.
When the final volume was published, he was filled with tears and his long journey to reach this mother ended.
With this success, she has taken the sport to new levels, as has athlete Michael Phelps, who will be seen once in a while in her career:
Biles, who has spent the last three years with 15 world championship medals, including 10 golds, and the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton, has been a stunning routine mix of passion and hate that has earned her the nickname "the best gymnast I have ever seen".
Brazil had a new test ahead of him; this competition was more between him and the heavy load of big customers than between him and the others.
The family event in Spring, Texas, was seen as a disappointment to return with fewer than a handful of gold medals.
Simone Biles, soldier, and Aly Raisman from the United States of America competed in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics in Brazil, after winning gold and silver medals respectively in the women's artistic gymnastics general classification, Perşembe, Ağu.
Biles, the first retired national team coordinator, won Tuesday's race as the unlemma sign at Martha Karolyi's farewell party.
If Bill insists that he never looks forward in a long run toward the summit, it is not true.
The inner part of the transition, which has become a symbol of the earth exercise routine, is made with Latin musicals that will fit perfectly into the caddeo just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
This is not a coincidence.
A girl discovered by Boorman's aunt, who was adopted as a younger child by her grandmother and grandfather and went on a trip to a gymnasium coached by Aimee Boorman, became a force.
Since the summer of 2013, the show has not lost any of its general ratings; it is a series of gags that should continue as long as Biles wants.
Mustafafina is currently in rotation and assuming leadership of this transition.
The denge and earth exercises for Biles' World Championships had not yet been performed.
The Denge had passed 15,433 points per day and this was achieved through the exercise of 15,933 points.
Raisman, his wife, waited for him to be clothed with a light coat, and as Biles' vision of a book of prose once became a reality, tears flashed around the bright red, white, and blue eye makeup.
Raisman's performance was like a replay of his performance four years earlier, when he shared fourth but then lost the bronze medal to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, whom the Americans call "trnine", was overtaken.
Once upon a time, a suspect seemed to have overcome a rebound and sent a kiss to the fisherman after the exercise.
For 19 year old Biles, it can be said that the tweet he posted earlier this week has now acquired a completely new meaning:
Police: Three victims on a series of bed rests, a music diner was shot.
In Phoenix's first series bed vacation in a decade, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot while talking and listening to music, according to police reports released on Thursday.
Yetkililer, Angela Rochtrelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah said that a car parked on a garage road was shot down on 12 June.
The report said the gunman fired a gun and eight guns while standing on the passenger side of the car and then drove away by other vehicle.
Police say the three films do not appear to be for shootout purposes because the attacker did not take the adult victims' suitcases or $2,900 in cash.
Phoenix Police spokesman Deputy Commissioner Jonathan Howard said the investigation into the shooting had led investigators to investigate whether it was related to the previous four attacks.
In a four-month period, a total of seven people were killed and two were injured in nine attacks on neighborhoods where Spanish girls live mainly.
Howard, earlier this month, told CBS affiliate KPHO, "Bu, a few days ago, we were in a residential area".
The suspect is believed to have driven a brown Nissan model in the late 1990s, a black BMW model in the late 1990s, and several vehicles with a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have denied any evidence that the attacks were related to the same bed and were carried out by the same bed.
Ellis (33) was taken to hospital with injuries and later died.
Liner (31) and Ellis's daughter Maleah died on the scene.
One witness, Olaya, told police that the music was not uncommon in the cars they parked.
Yettrkililer also released a police report about the shooting that took place an hour and a half ago in an empty truck.
The researchers uncovered the bullet holes, extracted a bullet from one seat and detected particulate matter in the engine area.
An annex to the 6-year-old microcephaly patient: "It's getting better and better".
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, playing with toys and, of course, his siblings.
However, Edmund's cousins have a microcephaly disorder; this is a genetic disorder that Elizabeth Picciuto was unaware of during her pregnancy.
When Eve first came, my first thought was that I would never do it.
I'm not going to do this.
I'm not going to do this.
These are of course not true, and of course they are not".
Kendisi and Vincent's wife, Edmund, were told that they would never know them and would not even survive.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest a vaginal vein.
"I just wanted to say that I don't think people do this anymore", Pictrciuto said.
Edmund, with the help of a walker, can walk.
Edmund, until he was three years old, could not sit or talk or even speak.
But he himself is slowly reaching certain milestones.
The helper is able to walk and ride a bicycle.
Besides, his two older brothers love to play video games and sing.
Elizabeth, showing Edmund the gesture he made up to say "please sing to the baby".
Pictrciuto, of CBS News, said, "We are teaching sign language".
But this is not a sign, as we know, but Edmund's invention of his own.
Microsephaly can occur due to a number of different conditions; a genetic condition such as Edmund may exist and may be caused during pregnancy by infections caused by viruses such as measles and Zika.
Belirtiler and the disease's pathogen may show very big differences.
It is more widely accepted to say how the lives of people with Zika infection will be affected by the condition.
Pictrciuto remembers the emotional burden of the uncertainty of the future.
I kept wondering what would happen.
What will happen?
Yet he himself does not know it.
In fact, I didn't ask anyone about the disease for a long time, since I didn't expect anyone to really tell me.
However, Picciuto, who is born with Zika, is able to offer hopeful advice for babies who are born with Zika.
Things are getting better.
You know it will be better for you.
You will love your children, and your children will love you.
Heavy rain and rainstorms in Louisiana, Mississippi, prompted rescue teams to move.
Heavy rainfall and widespread rainfall in Louisiana, with more rainfall expected by Saturday, and a state of emergency declared on Friday, led to a severe weather outbreak.
The National Weather Service reported numerous tidal storms in northeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi, creating a widespread water shortage after heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Beltrand Edwards said that state officials were in constant contact with local officials and that support for affected communities was on the way.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the Valilik Yurt İtrçi Güvenlik ve Acil Durum Hazırlığı Office, said there were demands for high-end vehicles, technicians and cyclists.

Simone, Gabby and Laurie are the reasons we need them.
I gave this name to the Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team this year, and for several reasons.
First, I've competed in every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never competed so much before.
Secondly, this team has three gymnasts that have inspired many girls of different ethnic backgrounds: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez.
The team, which was formed by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, is a source of pride for everyone.
Takım, finally a look similar to America.
It also strengthens the presence of black and Latino adult women at the highest levels of the sport.
In the past four years, the first female gymnast of African-American descent has become a full-time American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1st and 2nd.
But it's something powerful.
At the recent Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America supported her.
Now the whole world will be able to witness the extraordinary performances of Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who have won three World Championships, including their unexpected but highly-regarded gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win a gold medal in the women's overall classification.
And team-mate Aly Raisman Trophy winner won the silver medal.
We are familiar with this sport in its early days, but this does not seem to be the case in gymnastics courses across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same path as Aly and Madison to qualify for the Olympic team.
The reason they are "Son Beşli" is that there will be only four gymnasts on the next Olympic gymnastics team and this is the last year that Marta Karolyi will coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a very expensive sport, and gymnasts work primarily in private gym clubs supported by training, travel, fitness, competitions, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and families) and many more.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburbs where these businesses can be located.
This group is a long-term, cost-effective and long-term commitment to the training of gymnasts and the families of gymnasts.
Simone Biles' coaches Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez' coach Maggie Haney have been training these athletes since they started gymnastics.
We provide a more affordable and accessible gymnastics education for the countless girls affected by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
Ben started his own gymnastics practice in Kurdistan 20 years ago.
In my foundations, we have trained over 15,000 gay (mainly black and Hispanic) gymnastics students in Harlem, offering free and low-cost gymnastics training to both local and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (where I grew up) to provide quality gymnastics education to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this wonderful Olympic sport.
It improves fitness, body strength, flexibility and coordination, and provides mental strength, discipline and determination.
This combination has long-term benefits in terms of health, health, health and work success.
The team that will guide thousands of young girls to gymnastics will be the inspiration and a great thing.
Participation in sporting activities is very important, especially for the redhead.
We are living through truly exciting times.
Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison's Olympic team won gold medals in the women's team event, and thank you for showing them the "Girls' Generation" and motivating many young girls from different backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's refusal to take teklifinin, the assistant doctors decided to continue the strike.
Ministers, British Medical Association officials and negotiators agreed to end the dispute after a negotiated agreement was reached, but the 37,000 medical assistants who took part in the vote rejected the proposal 58 per cent.
In July, Mr Hunt announced plans to implement sanctions on the contract, saying the NHS "is no one's property" and that further suffering would harm staff and patients.
The first-aid doctor group, the geceleri and the weekends, were transferred to a new contract containing changes in working practices to improve the condition of the patient outside normal working hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, assistant chair of the BMA's doctoral committee, said in a statement last night: "The assistant doctors have serious concerns about the proposed contract; in particular they think it will trigger the current workforce crisis and that not all doctors will have an equal standard of care".
The first group of doctors to be transferred to a new contract is only eight weeks away from studying, and the time is running out.
BMA's efforts to resolve the dispute through dialogue were met with governmental inaction on interaction with the courts and, in some cases, even deaf-blindness.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt's verdict last month that the door will always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to move in here, lift sanctions and listen to the doctors' concerns".
Assistant doctors clearly state that they are prepared to increase the slowdown if they do not.
In the strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments were delayed, and nurses and counselors were forced to take the place of doctors on strike.
Ministers, British Trade Union officials and negotiators agreed that the dispute would be resolved after a negotiated agreement had been reached.
BtrMA, the contracting authority, wants to improve the weekend salaries for 54,000 physician assistants.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of the NHS, called on the doctors' assistants not to strike.
Mr Mortimer said: "Grev does not solve anything but creates pressure on the currently busy staff and servants, causing anxiety, discomfort and distress for patients, caregivers and families".
Over the past two months, we have continued to hold discussions with the Assistant Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other officials, have approached in a positive manner their concerns regarding the Supervisory Board and İhbarda Bulunma.
The business community, with significant connections - distribution, training flexibility, extra training for their inter-career partners, training costs, mutual agreement on the curriculum, training allowances and gender pay gaps - was pleased that the positive communication was a sign of how seriously the business community, the UK Ministry of Health and Medical Education, took action in line with the agreements reached with the BMA in Kasım, February and May.
A £2 per day costly drug that can eliminate the risk of a heart attack.
After the authorities recommend longer doses, thousands of heart attack patients could benefit from £2 per day of harmful medication.
Ticagrelor, which prevents contractions, reduces the risk of heart attacks for people with heart disease.
İtrlaç, who had a heart attack for the next 12 months, was given a felc or other risk of a heart attack.
NHS observer NICEtr recommended that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS observer NICE has recommended that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Every year, around 140,000 people in the UK suffer a heart attack, and a quarter of them suffer another attack or stroke.
The cause of calp crises and fells is that the fatty particles form plaques in the walls of the arteries.
If the placenta is torn, this can cause a blood clot and cause a heart attack by inflaming the heart.
The vein is removed from the ground and the blood flow is blocked by the brain, forming a felc.
People who have had one previous crisis have a higher risk of another.
Ticagrelor, created by the UK firm AtrZeneca under the trade name Brilique, reduces the likelihood of this risk by reducing the likelihood of this.
A NICE guide published today recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg twice daily with aspirin for three years.
Prof Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: "Despite the availability of adequate preventive treatments, about a quarter of heart attack victims are having another heart attack or stroke, and the results are often devastating".
The fear of depression, or depression, has a very negative effect on a person's quality of life.
Deliller, the use of ticagreltrur with aspirin, has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke in some people who have had previous heart attacks.
With Tictragrelor being provisionally recommended, we are pleased to have increased treatment options offered to thousands of people waiting to benefit from it.
Because three years of knowledge about the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of primary cancers - is limited, the guidebook does not recommend treatment after this period.
PC culture has increased voter corruption in Muslim regions.
Lutfur Rahman, former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was removed from office last year following a government report on corruption.
As the report of the Sunni government today shows, the culture of political integrity has led to a general disregard for voter corruption in Muslim communities.
Former Cabinet Minister Sörtr Eric Pickles slammed the police, election observers and municipal officials for ignoring allegations of electoral fraud because of "excessive ethnic and religious hatred".
A former community secretary and current anti-corruption official, he said the religious discrimination against voters was so severe that police were afraid to let them draw a banner outside the polling stations to protect voters.
Voters were asked to keep their identities with them to prove their identity when they voted.
In the case of Mevtrcut, it is enough to say the name and address of the voter.
The report also recommends that people be drawn a permanent ink to the parm during the voting process to prevent double voting.
Sörtr Eric said that the finds of the fish should be better protected.
He called for better access to the Basina for decisions of Kendisi, council members and informal committees or working groups.
"This is not only to protect against electoral corruption, but also to protect the local government from the culture of corruption and money laundering that goes along with it", he said.
The report was prepared under the direction of Downing Street following the Tower Hamlets vote scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after a series of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "abuses the religious sentiments of the Muslim community in the country" and intimidates his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman was described as "a campaign run by unbelieving Muslims as a fundamental day in which he believes that religion is a duty".
Up to 300 games were the result of suspicion or the use of false information, i.e. voting like someone else.
Sörtr Eric said there were allegations of fraud across the country.
Kendisi, especially in the post-electoral elections, warned against corruption - where the elderly in the Muslim community claimed to be oppressed by the electorate.
Sörtr Eric, has made some suggestions for the regulation of the voting system in a way that includes a kimlik bulletin and a checklist to prove who individuals are.
The report included the following statements: "It was found that some ethnic minority groups have been oppressing their valued individuals, especially women and youth, particularly in Pakistan and Bangladesh's indigenous communities, in order to ensure that older people are voted on according to their wishes.
"There were concerns that government institutions were ignoring such behaviour because of the 'political correctness' of their excessive hatred of ethnicity and religion".
Sör Eric, 50 proposals were made to regulate the system including the prevention of the processing of postal mail and mail by political activists for the purpose of "oy toplama".
The report, commissioned by Theresa May, also calls for tightening registration controls to prevent the electoral roll being used for immigration and welfare fraud purposes.
The condition of the election is that the voters will indicate their identity before the vote.
Any person who uses permanent ink on the person's fingers after the vote to prevent double-blindness.
To determine the suitability of the person to pay the OI, systematic checks on the person's sleep are carried out.
A three-year limitation on the use of automatic mail voting is applied.
A ban on political campaign officials and activists from processing completed postal ballots and postal ballot envelopes.
Police, and other security forces around the area are not authorized to do so.
The 1983 law of the people's court was amended to facilitate the prosecution of corruption.
It is illegal to take photos in the cabins.
In the offices of the Oy verme (Gallertr haresien) only the prerequisite for speaking English is fulfilled.
Strengthen the training of the electorate personnel on enforcement of the rule of exclusive entry into the cabinet.
Sir Eric fiercely criticised the Police Service, saying that no charges had been brought against the Tower Hamlets.
"The Seçim court ruled that there was no room for prosecution for alleged corruption and illegal activities for the Seçim court, Lutfur Rahman and his representative", it said.
For a number of reasons, he himself was convicted beyond reasonable suspicion - according to the nature of his deception.
Kendisi also criticized the ineffective "kutucuk marking controls" in the electoral register departments of the municipal authorities.
Sörtr Eric said: "Last year's Tower Hamlets court ruling was a wake-up call.
While the National Assembly has the pride of being the mother of parliaments, the spread of this worrying and covert election corruption and the rejection of it by some bodies can lead to the decline of this prestige.
Kate's bike-bender and other famous Rio Olympic athletes are crazy about the similarities.
This week, the Rio 2016 Olympic Games hostess went crazy for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who impressed the Duchess of Cambridge with her impressive performance.
But the 24-year-old Olympic sportsman, who is struggling for a gold medal this summer, is not the only sportsman who has attracted attention with the similarity of the famous ones; at least that's how social media thinks.
Therefore, the sheriff of all the famous Sims we see on our screens and at the Rio Games, FEMAIL, has prepared a list of Olympic athletes who have made them beyond the Olympic Games to Hollywood celebrities.
Avcı and Kurt: Brady Ellison (soldier) of the US Army's Erkekler Okçuluk Team, who has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
As well as the similarity in Kate's bike path, many people online have shown that a single octopus can match Leonardo DiCaprio's twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the USA Men's Swimming Team, took to Twitter after photos of him showing his resemblance to the star of the movie Para Avengers were revealed.
Ve okçu and social media users realized this madness and admitted that from childhood he was told Leo'ya benzedique.
Brady, Huffington Post, said: 'I don't think there is much similarity between Ben's hair and beard.'
'Kendisi is a handsome man, so I guess this is iltifat.'
There was one more similarity, which was one of the popular comparisons of London 2012 and will undoubtedly be more noticeable this year: the incredible similarity of British long jumper Greg Rutherford's popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with large and meaningful eyebrows, and Cuban-American artist Gloria Estefan, were said to be the same.
Ve havuzda, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh, has been a fan of glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Change: This user states that Nathan's Genesis movie star is an 'athletic version'.
Tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett have long been compared to each other because of the similarity of their faces and lips.
Russian team silver medalist, actress Annalynne McCord and her fans with the same bronze dress and blonde hair say that Nathan Adrian of the US Team'made Joseph Gorgon Levitt's athletic version of himself.'
Sert women: Soccer star Hope Solo (soldier) and Dexter star Jennifer Carpenter (sağda) have similar facial features and eyes.
He's not alone: One Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed this similarity.
A theory from Havada: This user thinks that there may be a reason behind the pair's similar appearance.
One Twitter user expressed his happiness over the "tren age internet ageing that makes Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter feel like twins".
The reality is that the US soccer star and actress playing Dexter have similar facial features and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kertrri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney's almost identical smile, which is shared by another gold medal gymnast, Gabby Douglas, and Gençlik Ateşi star Gabrielle Union's huge smiles.
CBC Olympic spikeri, the Chinese figure skater, apologized for the comment that he 'died like a pig'.
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place in the 4x200m freestyle relay angered the CBC's live Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize for the comments of a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer who was "swollen like a bad ass" and died in the race "like a pig".
Speakers Byron MacDonald thought the microphone was off when she started expressing her thoughts in the women's 4x200m freestyle final.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC's spokesman team to'renk' Kattruk, was reported to have said: 'A 14-year-old Chinese boy screwed up, baby.'
Faztrla was excited, slipped like a bad cock and died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yantrhan (14), who finished second in the flag race with a time of 1:57.79, set the Canadian Taylor Rack'in 1.61 seconds behind the Canadian to bridge the gap between China and Canada.
The Canadian track cyclist, after being stunned by the tone and tone of the track, quickly moved.
Emmett Macfarlane "CtrBC spokesman said earlier that the 14-year-old suspect had died 'like a pig' in a tweet.
Gertrude didn't know he was on the air.'
Chinese Ai Yanhan, 4 x 200 m Serbest Bayrak Competition was described as: 'A 14-year-old Chinese boy screwed hard, baby.'
Twitter quickly and quickly became a source of criticism about Byron MacDonald, and many of them liked him for his personality.
Twitter users were shocked to learn how unscrupulous Byron Macdonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Way #ByrontrMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists. #midebulanttr
Shortly afterwards, CBC broadcaster Scott Russell apologized for MacDonald's comment: "We apologize for the comment made on the broadcast about the Yuzme race".
These are truly random words, and I'm sorry that such an event happened.'
CtrBC, as a commentary, tweeted that the people had been excused at least 90 times.
Another speaker, Scott Russell, was forced to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC later copied and pasted the apology to over 90 Twitter users who forwarded complaints about MacDonald's comments.
Ağ, quickly apologizing, issued a statement.
We would like to express our deepest regret that these statements were made and that they were published.
Yesterday evening, on the air, in the streets, on social media and in our followers, we quickly apologized.
I would like to clarify that Byron's comments are not about the personality of the wearer, but about performance.
However, these are very inappropriately and unintentionally chosen words, and Byron is deeply sorry for what he has said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the air and tried to defend his words by saying he did not want to commit personal assault.
"I want to apologize for a comment I made after the women's flag race last night", said Kendisi, on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
'I was not referring to the personality of Yuzüc but to his performance.'
'Fazla zze gerek no, to disrespect me is not allowed and I am very sorry.'
Primark customer, in the middle of the store, is a woman who is in the middle of a shop.
Customers, they didn't know what to do when a woman took off her underwear to wear underwear in the middle of the Primark store.
Worse, the woman looked at how it looked on her, took it out and re-shared it.
She continued and then went to the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone to wear four pairs of denedi.
Before she was re-shelved, the skirt was worn by the Primark store in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
Two younger sisters, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that after denying the woman's underwear, "they took her yeniden dress and anything else out of the store".
"People couldn't believe their eyes", said Kendisi.
He stood in the middle of the store and took a pair of panties from the window, took off his panties and pants and put them on.
'He did not seek a special place to make a well, he was disrespectfully disposed of.'
"As he removed the panties, everyone was looking at him and it was clear that he didn't like the panties because he was racing again".
He did three more laundries until he decided he didn't like anything and then went out of the store dressed again.
"The person who followed him seemed to be out of his mind and did not think about who would buy the underwear he wore later".
Bayantr Davidson, 33, of Kent, said: 'It is irresponsible to think that someone would take a brick, an unwashed pantie, and go home.'
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Mr Davidson said: 'I think you put the giysiler on the market after the release of Personalelin, which is a good thing.'
'When I go home with a new underwear, it would be really bad to think that someone else is taking off the underwear and coming to the bathroom without washing.'
A Primark spokesperson said: 'Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9.'
The related product has been withdrawn from sale.
How can you protect yourself from Kravtr Maga and armed attackers?
The outside world is quite dangerous, but a video like this from Dailymail.com can help you be safer.
To learn how to deal with the newly formed Krav Maga Federation, we met with Rhon Mizrachi, the head of the New York-based Krav Maga Federation, to learn how to deal with the newly armed soyagun.
Whether you are looking forward to it or not, this video will show you how to turn the situation into a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Mizrachi, when approaching the size arc, says that the first thing you should do is turn your face and see the attacker and 'unload the firewall'.
Then you will be able to shoot the gun in the face with your bare hands between your shoulder and your forearm.
Then when you hit the back of the head, the attacker's pain will double and at this point he will turn the gun and take the gun from his hand, while the gun is turned on, and you will hit the gun in the face in a way that the blade and the arrow will be upwards.
A similar technique is used when the armed person approaches the front; you pull your body from the line of fire and turn the gun so that the attacker does not fire.
At the same time, by putting your weight on the weapon, you turn the gun from the attacking region of the Ghogus, take it from him and point the gun at him by guerrilla action.
Is Kulatrğa alengirli coming to me?
Watch the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
But remember; if you are not a Kravtr Maga master, the safest way to avoid her soygundan is to give your parents soyguncuya.
Gezgin Ian Wright drove his diary to Europe and beyond for travel guides.
British travellers, some of the most dangerous and dangerous places in Europe, have been seriously tested for their immune system and their eating reflexes.
Sunucu and electrical writer, Suffolklu Ian Wright (51), to prove the power of the immune system, drove a cheap Euro banknote, a Piccadily Circus, a train toilet siphon button and a Russian phone with an anchor.
Her granddaughter used a luminometer to show herself and us what kind of work she was doing.
However, a film adaptation of The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which was to be made into a movie, yielded some surprising results.
The idea of a trendy birtreki siphon button used by thousands of people is extremely untrue, although in fact there are many more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
During his trip to Europe, Bay Wright met with doctors and medical professionals about the growth and health of bacteria in the stomach.
Nothing Netryse ki licked was effective except the bad tat he left in his mouth.
Bay Wright was known for testing the resilience of his machine by making the world go round and round and eating amazing things.
From the general closures at train stations to toilet seat buttons, this task, which was a wide range of tasks, definitely tested the immune system.
In a film about it, he said: 'I have not been a health worker since I was a child and I have been soaking up so much stuff, including soil, solucan and mud water.'
The film surresince de la vérité has conclusively proved the cause of this untruth.
Reddettiği tek şey, the Russian dish of pis bir umumi tuvaletti.
The sample of the screw showed a luminometer measurement over 4000 units.
If a transfer is required, the newly washed ores must be below 60.
But when the newly washed light meter measurement rose above 4000 units in the 60s, it became a Russian general toilet, which refused to be used.
Bay Wright and Fin milk products manufacturer Valio took over the production of the film The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which showed the number of bacteria in different places such as bathrooms, bathrooms and other places.
Kendricks said in the film, 'This is one of the worst things I've ever done in a toilet.'
Nothing could be worse than that!
Since the drink is so bitter, I will not lick anything.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, a Finnish dairy product, was developed in collaboration with manufacturer Valio.
The company, Bay Wright's lactic acid bacterium, as well as vitamin C and D containing Valio Gefilus, helped to strengthen the gut bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Vice President of Valio'nun Snacks, Fruit Suits and New Categories, said: "We are really trying to bring something new to consumers.
Something that is impressive and will also explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've done a lot of crazy brainstorming lately, where the idea of "let's call Ian" came to mind.
They claim that the interest in mental health has become a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put the products in a much broader context; the good and bad bacteria that surround us daily, the importance of stomach health and its connection to the immune system.
The interest in mental health is becoming a global phenomenon, and this will be able to inform consumers of this situation in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
The film, directed by Tom Hakala, exclaims: "I told you this; Ian, if there were some things I wish I could do like the Russian tuvaleti shown in the film, I would lose my anger at it.'
Naturally, some things are easy for Ian to lick, while some are quite difficult.
I'm glad we've recorded some of these pisses.'
A 2015 survey by Valio found that 84 percent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria to gut health and 58 percent said they used products containing lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
Maganda aile, a tahlitrye öncesinde in Saltash, Cornwall social community is located in tahrip etti.
A family member, who was forced to leave their neighbourhood, suffered a £50,000 loss in social security accounts.
After numerous complaints about Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shatrun Trebilcock, the county of Saltash, Cornwall was dissolved.
When Mülkten was removed, the county authorities were surprised to find that the property was in a state of disrepair.
Large decks were found on the walls, floor planks were torn down, trash was scattered over the ground and wall inscriptions were written on the walls.
Atrile has now been removed from the account and is now being restored to its use of special conversation options.
Donna McEvoy, director of housing repair at Cornwall Housing, expressed her fear that the situation could not be repaired.
Kendisi said: 'Bu, I think it's a real nightmare for the people here and I don't think people should have to live like this.
There is much to consider, as this estate will no longer be bilineated as an unpleasant part of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation and their children have a bad reputation.
Ailen had three sons who lived in the same neighborhood and had a family that, according to the police, engaged in a lot of abusive behavior, including fighting with a baseball bat, neighboring residents' courtship, drug use, drug dealing and excess racketeering, competition and blasphemy.
In June, an antisocial conduct order was issued for Skeldon (47), who is named in Kira's contract.
In many of the Odas where the destruction was thought to have occurred, an old trash can was found.
The flooring boards of the property, which had previously been used for drug trafficking, had been removed.
The neighbor said he saw them fighting on the street and often called the police.
Cornwall Housing, after extending the 11-week period for their voluntary relocation, released him and his wife from the estate this week.
The evacuation process was met with delight by relaxed neighbors who said their lives were turning into nightmares.
One person said, 'No one was their age.'
We have lived with them for 20 years and their situation is very bad.
I'm telling you how many times we've seen cops here, you won't believe it.
'Bu tr sabah, this is my dream.'
We woke up because the place was so quiet; we're not used to it!
But, finally, she's going to be great.
Cornwall Housing'in neighbourhood inspector Adam Fitzpatrick said he had cooperated with the local authority.
Atrile, who had lived in the house for 20 years, and the property were often called to the police.
The social environment was covered with vegetables and garbage and old toys were thrown into the side of the plant.
Ştrunu added: 'It is truly shameful that the client himself and his family are not responsible for the care of the family; this has always been the option he has applied for as a son of Cornwall Housing.
It was a very difficult year because the events were extremely high and the neighbors' testimony was so scary.
I highly appreciate the efforts of the Police Forces of Ekibimin, Devontr and Cornwall and the community members who have come forward to inform us.
I hope this development will bring some comfort to the neighbors and will be understood as a message that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Baytr Fitzpatrick said they had three sons who lived at the estate at different times but were in their 20s.
Kirli bir yatak, which was left on the ground in one of the rooms of the evintr yatak after the evacuation, was left on the ground.
The construction workers' homes will need to be cleaned of the surrounding garbage dumps.
In 2014, the police owned more than 70 grams of marijuana, tartar, special items and £1,700 in cash for bulldogs.
Skeldon, who was sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to a class B drug charge, was released.
Partrayı claimed to use it to purchase a tombstone for his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After the break, it was discovered that Tanya and her husband now have a private account in Plymouth.
On the walls of most of Evintr's halls were wall inscriptions.
Police said they will work to free the renters who violate the rent rules.
Angela Crow, from the Devon and Cornwall Police Force, said the evacuation was a warning to other tenants who continued to follow the rules.
Kendricks said, 'This is a message for those who think they can do whatever they want without any problems and that their behavior will be futile.'
The Devon and Cornwall Police Force, which will continue to work with partners to protect the toplume, will never tolerate such and antisocial behaviour.
When a military plane flying from Alçatran passed over here, tourists in Portugal fell into a state of despair.
The sun-drenched tourist in Portekiz, Aveiro, experienced the shock of their lives.
The Portuguese air force's P-3C Orion flew from a very high altitude.
The Air Force said it was a training flight, but insisted there was no safety risk.
This is where tourists who pass over the Alçaldan jet-dull beach start to panic.
In dramatic images, military aircraft approaching the sun-drenched mountains of Aveiro'da, north of Porttrekiz'in, almost at the theme level.
The scouts were shocked to hear the noise of jet engines, which was clearly visible, before they could tell what was coming towards them from the clouds.
Otrlay, yesterday afternoon, occurred on the Costa Nova near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several executives who shared a video of a dramatic near-flight on social media, said: 'Two times I really went over the top and at one point I looked like I was about to hit it.'
Ntruno Arroja exclaimed: 'I was surfing and I swear I felt like a plane was going to fall on me.'
Tourist from Aveiro, Kumsaldaki, fell into a state of shock when the plane that came out of the darkness began to fly at extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify the fishing techniques on board and was in a position to go so low that it was the only way to control them.
The nearby turbulent force said the jet was flying lower than normal, as visibility was weak due to smoke from the fire, but the air force insisted that safety was not compromised.
This summer, fires in the mainland of Portugal severely damaged certain parts of the island and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot had to fly low due to conditions that made it difficult to see (intense hail and smoke from the fire).
The Uçak was a training flight and as part of the training the pilot was asked to identify fishing techniques.
A Londoner female student, Suriye'de, who was involved in ISIL, was killed.
It was reported that Kadiza Sultana, the daughter of three British female students who left London to join ISTRİD last year, had died in Syria.
His lawyer Tasnime Akuntrjee said his family had been informed of his death in Rakka, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that he is believed to have died in a Russian airstrike on the country's strongest city, Rakka.
Sultana, 17, died while planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"In this situation, we hope that the tombstone for others and the vicarage as well as the people will emphasize the real risk of going to war zones and that people will be discouraged about this choice".
In February 2015, Sultana and two female students from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
It is said that the Sultan's family had married a Syrian fighter from ISIL and that he had been in a coma.
Reid has stated that he will not relinquish Garland's position as a Supreme Court nominee until Clinton is elected.
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid has expressed his hope that he will nominate Justice Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court in the event of the election of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
Republicans in the Senate have been hampering Garland's approval process since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, has announced that the new president will select a successor.
Reid, in a video address on Thursday, said he believed Clinton would choose Garland and that he had "reasons for doing so".
Later, a spokesman for Reid said he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether or not he would nominate Garland and that he was speculating.
Kendisi praised Garland and Clinton's team said they did not want to "move the situation" by holding a new election.
Gartrand, District of Columbia, USA, is the chief judge of the Temyiz Court.
Reid, who opposed Garland's candidacy, said Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was "a man of his dreams" and "a man of his dreams".
Trump has stated that he is not fit for the job.
Treats, 'as for the erkeckler as for the women's de' a naked takvimden yana was noted.
Treats magazine, is working with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar of Pirelli's 1970s-inspired preparations for 2017.
But instead of celebrities and nude people, they are working to find the next generation of top models for the 2017 NU İlham Perileri calendar.
Treats' president Steve Shaw said that the magazine, which had a high nudity rate earlier this year, was different from the old Playboy because it said "Playboy is for men".
I do this for women.
Beltrami believes that such a date exists.
"Like Erkekler, we need to go back to the classic, unfashionable nudity showcase, so that women and women can easily get inspired by these images of their bodies", Shaw said in the newsletter of the calendar.
Women, since it is a beautiful art chair, will want to be a part of this project.
Models can be photographed online or take part in open meetings in Los Angeles and New York.
Vintril target: buy a plate that actually works for you?
Middle-aged, only male vinyl is available.
Before we go to the comment section to find some amazing hacks under the sunshine, let me tell you that this statement is based on a real truth.
According to YouGov, the recycling of the much-discussed plates is not the result of a new Y-shaped pursuit created by a physical object, but of a middle-aged nostalgia.
Recently, vinyl album buyers are mostly between 45 and 54 years old.
Astrna, for example, is 18-24 year old and low probability.
It is also not just the collective actions of fans; it is emotional in importance; older vinyl buyers tend to be those who retain their emotions for themselves (56% and 53%) and those who enjoy being alone (69% and 66%).
So are YouGov'un's conclusions correct?
If this blog were a television news story, if Soho's camera was a streetcar, if he was walking in a modest gray suit, if he had been in a blog before, many are sergilerken and if he had opened it, he would have been saying something like this: "I'd have one eye".
Well, let's have a look.
The center of Soho has gradually lost its charm and unusual appeal (once owned by independent retailers, it is now filled with hotels, eateries, pret and paperchases) and there are several specialist record shops.
I would probably like him to stay in the camera for the next part; I would sit next to the different men in some of these stores and try to get information about their age and emotional state through observation.
Sister Ray'den (veri tr sayımı: two young women, three middle-aged men) is following me on the way to Reckless Records (veri sayımı: eight middle-aged men, probably a woman in her 20s) and is having an afternoon in London for a meeting with Stuart (55), who is looking into stores to fill a few hours of vacations.
I'm asking about a collector.
"I'm trying to do that", he says.
I have about 3000 or 4000 litres of plague.
Officially, the plaque above (officially sent by e-mail, I didn't follow him until recently) adorned the walls of the living room.
The reason for the accumulation of so many albums and singles is partly a result of the disposable income; now, when it first came out, he can buy the records he didn't have yet and buy back what he sold when he was young and broke.
"Most of the things I got were in the late '60s and early '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12 years old; I was too young to get them", he says.
He agrees with his view that those who buy the plaque are more likely to become just seven-word, drunk people, and adds: "I smoke, too much alcohol.
My bad taste is in the air.
Wetr (25) who works for Sister Ray, believes that most of the clients she meets with are YouGov profiles.
But he himself, in the media, realized that a new wave of over-the-top advertising was forming, and that those who felt this trend was coming back needed to buy back old records.
In an interview I realized that normally in 1998 or 1999 you burned down people's collections.
"Customers who sold their vinyl records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to get their records back", he says.
This may explain the rise of people of a certain age who are re-canting vinyl.
What about the alleged emotional importance of the plates?
It takes a few seconds to realize that record stores like Phtronica are a comfortable community of people with similar personalities.
According to Wetrz, some older customers, especially the issueless payment system, have been compromised.
Some vinyl records may want to take refuge in the sticker of familiar record covers, reminiscent of the recalled and re-released youthful memories of the digital world.
"Sometimes it can be because of filling a void or seeing material items as a kind of comfort", says Wez.
I am a collector myself, so I think that is what most people are.
This is an easy way to fill your cupboard.
"We are like social workers", says a coworker who jumped from a pile of signs.
A survey conducted in April last month revealed that 50% of vinyl album buyers have yet to listen to an album.
The survey also found that 41 percent of the people in the industry never used vinyl and 7 percent bought vinyl despite not having any vinyl records.
In this phase, probably a number of bossa nova players are incelerken extremely worried about the appearance of the show.
This reversal is an element that was noticed by Jonny (42) who worked on Sounds of Universe'de.
"Not long ago a bear came up and said, 'I don't play any records, but I want to buy a Radiohead record to put on our shelves.'"
This large percentage represents a clear reflection of the current situation.
More products, less music.
There were people who said, "I don't play records".
These are not old people, but younger people, those in their late teens, newcomers to this business.
When I arrive at Fopp's, which has now set aside almost a whole card for vinyl, I see that the volume is quite variable.
There were farmers in their 70s, tourists taking photographs, young boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less cool than the above-mentioned shops and pop-up sex is spreading instead of calming jazz from speakers, it's good to see the diversity among customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it is difficult to solve the psychological trauma that has plagued them for 30 seconds in the presence of someone else.
Elantrora (27), for a few minutes, is a Fopp'ta geziniyor and checking the plaque in my face.
Instead of making harcama, he just went out to bake in the windows.
Kendisi says that she doesn't make much money and that she doesn't have a plaque collection option.
He is very malicious.
It is easier to listen to music from a computer or other form of music, but the beauty of vinyl... "the inside of the soundtrack is moving away.
I don't know how to explain it, there really is no benzeri.
I'm a fan of the new generation of vinyl outfitters, which are inspired by the urban outfitters.
As I dress up like a panty-catcher, I watch a group of teenage girls gather around a Polaroid camera for a while before a father and daughter argue about buying a Crosley plaque.
There is a ladder hole filled with plaques by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac; there are no plaques for an average collection; there is a mix of modern and classic.
No one bakes; perhaps these are only for decorative purposes, some too high to touch.
This is completely "sanatsal birtr vinyl".
But the increased interest in these items may mean that the sector will earn more and send fewer customers to Soho's shores; there is not much to complain about.
It is not surprising that a demographic with more money than most people spends more on more luxurious items, such as vinyl.
But my bulge, Youtrov's findings show that they are accurate, at least in Soho record stores; in fact, the overcrowded do not take into account female collectors and vinyl artists found in record stores or online forums.
These people, probably working in offices or offices, work quite hard.
These people certainly don't spend Thursday evenings in the record shops on Berwick Street sneaking around, searching for the plates, and sneaking over the shoulders of middle-aged men who know nothing.
The Greenland shark, the world's longest-living vertebrate animal, is a member of the Greenland family.
Scientists have reported that the Greenland shark is the longest-lived of the vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who conducted work on shark reptiles, stated that the record was held by a five-meter-long female, believed to be between 272 and 512 years old.
A French court has rejected a motion to demolish shops in the Jungletr refugee camp.
A French court rejected the proposal of the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of derme-cake shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court hearing this week, Calais officials argued that the 72 derme çatma shops in which people in the state's camp sold many products ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, haircutting or selling basic meals for 50 cents (40p) or a few euros for tea, should be demolished.
The Governor of Calais has argued that these places should be demolished because they have created a parallel economy without taxation and because they contain risks of fire and migration.
The aid group explained to the court that shops and restaurants are vital, and free food provided by government-backed organizations and other groups is not enough for the growing population in the camp.
Derme çattrma shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
A court in Lille held that there was no legal basis for deporting people who owned 72 derme çatma shops, but that Calais Valisini's concerns were "quite understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that bakeries, cafes and restaurants play a much larger role than simply feeding people who live in "extremely dangerous conditions".
He said these areas provide convenient meeting points for refugees, military personnel and volunteers.
The Jungle Children's Book Cafe, a nonprofit that serves 200 meals a day, teaches English and French, and advises hundreds of underage refugees in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a diligence order to consume this coffee, which is for children.
In a letter to the Guardian, the closure was described as "a facial expression for these children, some of whom are as young as eight years old".
Two charitable groups, Helptrugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that the population of the Jungle Camp had risen to over 9,000 (to date, a high number) after a number of summer camps.
After the gold medal in the Fiji master class, Britain won the silver medal in the rugby sevens championship.
The impressive progress in the UK Rugby 7'l Championship, Fiji and the final on Thursday, ended after a 43-7 defeat at the Rio Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji, her favorite country to win the gold medal, her first Olympic medal, has mastered skill in kavrama, pas, yan step, support, running hatları and kas kuvveti.
After the defeat, Britain won the third silver medal of the day as a not-so-bad consolation prize and can now be proud of their efforts in the opening tournament of the 7th Olympiad, beating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Earlier in the day, they were 7-5 in the semi-final and South Africa's East would have been able to beat them in the final.
But still, with such a large size, Fiji could even win a team of 15.
It may not be so incredible, but perhaps it is comforting to think that Britain will win at least one British gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's head coach, Ben Ryan, is an Englishman from Wimbledon.
It was a rather difficult journey for Great Britain.
Six years ago, when they worked with Ryan, they lost her match in the Adelaide Yedili Championship.
This time, only one of them lost.
Although the progress made can be painful, it is truly staggering.
Fiji, with an impressive start, played a game, and has been a great success over the last few years in the UK's top-tier initiatives.
It was like running between a series of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and his crew, and World Series champions Osea Kolinisao took a 5-0 lead when he moved from the corner.
In the fourth minute, Jerry Tuwai faced another number.
The match was 12-0, and Great Britain almost scored a better goal.
Mitchell's great intervention prevented Leone Nakarawa from reaching the third pole, but he only managed to cut off the number of Fijians.
In the first minute, Jasa Veremalua scored a right-handed touchdown, and Great Britain fell behind 17-0 in the final.
Just one minute into the first half, Nakarawa en Batan scored another goal.
Vatemo Ravoutrvou then crossed the line for the score, passing through some tough British interventions.
With this number, the score between the devtrre and the number 29-0 was reached.
While Fiji was formed to play in the 7th edition of the tournament, Great Britain seemed to be just learning the basics.
Durtrum is about that.
Great Britain made major changes between the two and closed the Fiji dam; for four minutes it improved well from the first half until Joshua Tuisova took the stage with the perfect Fijian game.
Dan Norton, a British international, was found guilty of attempting to make a 36-7 draw by scoring a single point, although the game was dominated by the South Denizli Islands, who sang, sailed flags and danced.
It was really hard not to be impressed by Fiji's sonatra-n-shelly approach.
Maa Viliame, in recent minutes I have been making some pretty good comments about Fiji's game.
When the sound of the trumpet sounded, Fijililer began to crumble and Britain was heathened and led the way to the sounma odas.
Earlier in the day, Fiji, which defeated Japan 20-5 in the semi-final, and Great Britain faced South Africa in a hard-fought semi-final; Britain were one step ahead.
Kyle Brown, in the first half, led the South African team to the finish with Dan Norton's head-spinning moves and the second half's points.
In England's top 15 including Anthony's brother Marcus Watson's great defense with a win and silver medal guaranteed.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, coaches of the team, were inspired by their battle with cancer and won the race.
There will be no more emotional gold medal at these Games, and this is of great significance.
After 220 painful breaths from the first to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning realized that the moment they won gold at Estacio da Lagoa could be much more meaningful.
Although she had two rowers, she had three seeds; the women's doubles event was the first in England to achieve this level this year, and coach Robin Williams's technique session was echoed as they advanced to their second Olympic gold medal.
The judges were quite frank; this was their 39th race of the unprecedented series.
We are very happy to see that this wonderful sporting event does not exactly reflect the quality of this image.
Behind her crowned gold medal, there was a body of willing men who made a difference and made artistic gains, and no body was as effective as the trainers who 30 months ago, when diagnosed with cancer, did not know if they would live long enough to see the day.
As he said, the doctors and doctors went.
I have been treated with a prevention of mesothelioma, and they have done so.
After that, her wife is leaving.
That would be a pretty bad situation.
Bu, it's changing your way of looking at life a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Kendisi, out of the season, was lucky enough to start treatment in early 2014, so it's not clear if the correct expression would be in such cases, but it would cause distraction and distraction.
I needed to get better quickly because I needed to get better.
This is an incentive for me.
I was hurrying and walking to the garden, 6, 9, 15 meters, even though they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing is either a journey on its own or it makes it a little bigger.
After the victory, the intellectuals spoke a little more than usual to overcome their own concerns, and it was Williams who had a nervous morning.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Topchu Trophy and had previously been to Afghanistan, said: "I was emotionally devastated this week, maybe a little overwhelmed or a little bit too much".
This, I stress once again, is not a big deal to me and how hard Helen, Ben and Robin work.
I had a wonderful three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be here, so I want to thank him for being the best coach in the world.
I could have found a better person to work with or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in five years.
The two are stuck in a difficult rhythm that their opponents cannot reach.
Stanning and Glover's strength was not yet exhausted at the last 500 metres, which the New Zealand and Danish teams had closed.
We were so self-absorbed.
Helen would say'süreci izletr, process izle'.
Capturing and keeping track of it is really important.
We got off to a good start and were trying to do something amazing.
We didn't expect the Hawaiian Fires to explode today, we just wanted to win the race we did well, and we did.
İtrkili, will take a year off before deciding what to do next.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month; his wedding and that of TV executive Steve Backshall.
For now, he just wants to enjoy it.
I'm not going to say this is my last race.
That would have put a lot of pressure on him.
It took me six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion in London.
It was very new and I was very stressed.
Here, it took about four minutes.
This is a much better beer than histr".

Bulgaria's first deflation inflation figures were released.
According to national statistics, in June, inflation in Bulgaria was at the level of 1%.
This is the highest value seen in years (from March 2012 onwards), but the first value seen above zero since the month of Ekim after a positive 0.2% last year.
The average annual inflation measured by the CPI for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index for July 2016 was 101.0 percent compared to June 2016, which means that inflation was 1.0 percent.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate (comparison between July 2016 and December 2015) has been -0.2%, while the monthly inflation rate between July 2016 and July 2015 has been -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month in July 2016, price increases were observed in the following consumer product groups: Food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transportation (1.8%), entertainment and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), and multifamily goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in the groups of Giyecek and ayakkabı (2.2%), furniture, equipment and rutin bakım (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
Alcoholic beverages and tobacco manufacturers, konut, su, electricity, gas and other fuels; prices remained the same in the communication and training groups.
Snapchat "Anime" Effects, Asyalı Cartoonists have been selected as the Best of the Best.
While Snapchat claims that animelertr was inspired by this filter, some observers say this is racially insensitive.
Snapchat, a social media platform, enables approximately 150 million users every day to play with their content at an absurd level, altering reality.
You can turn yourself into a beer, pineapple, dog, or a splashy character from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The products are perverse, feature-changing tools that create over 30 million custom checks developed daily.
Steps taken wrongly are quickly becoming a public affair.
Snapchat merchants have faced accusations in the past that the app promotes black classification or that it promotes white skin tones as beauty ideals.
Therefore, this week, due to the fact that the lenses that users wear are made of eyebrows, eyebrows, and eyebrows, some critics criticized the company for caricating Asians as "Asian masks".
And they wondered if these disputes would mark a larger trend for the company to diversify.
News and outrage spread on Wednesday via The Verge and Motherboard, and a day later Snapchat announced it had removed the feature.
The company made a statement: Mercek was not designed to be cartooned, but to be worn by anime characters.
But for observers with experience of racism, this mercek, can reminded of pathetic stereotypes.
Other people generally have redirected the comparison of anime.
In a tweet about the photographers, a Korean-American art student, Grace Sparapani, said that the e-mail was "in a slight way painful and upsetting".
"I have concluded that the debate is difficult when it comes to comparing the cartoon and the filter effects side by side.
This shows that the filter is not only an Astryalı mask, but also a disgraceful level of Asyalı mask.
Snapchat, the cultural trigger mechanism, is more than just a company.
American culture, from the meeting rooms of institutions to Hollywood and the devices we all carry, is seen to be in endless conflict over diversity and captivity in many areas.
And as Snapchat has pointed out, racial diversity can be interpreted as the extent to which a broad younger group of people who are more diverse than their peers can live in a more vibrant society.
In an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that since one of Snapchat's features created a demeaning image for a user, "such movements as sketches are much harder to spot".
On Thursday, Bayan Zhu, a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and called on everyone to do so.
In an article for Medium and a telephone interview, he said he believed that racial conflicts reflected the lack of diversity in Snapchat's workplace applications.
Bayan Zhu, the company's majority white male leadership team, criticized the magazine with a tag: #SnapchatiSilin.
"Because there is insufficient racial diversity among the staff, they can make such decisions, either because they are working there and are men of different races, even if they do not feel safe or comfortable enough to talk to themselves", said Bayan Zhu, a Chinese-American.
Other observers share their views on this complaint, which Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
The company, emphasizing its status as a private company, does not share figures on the diversity of staff.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to share the racial background of its staff, but according to one spokesperson, the company recently took on a job with the goal of increasing its focus and involvement in the underlying work of targeting and engaging underrepresented populations.
Ms. Zhu, for her part, said she would shut down her Snapchat account and exclaimed, "I wonder if more users like us need to tell me that this is not true".
The Congress Panel, the military officials, and the IŞİD Intelligence Committee said Tahrif Ettiğini.
In a report released on Thursday, a congressional panel said that the United States Central Committee officials had analyzed intelligence reports to paint a more detailed picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events of Sahadaki.
An interim report by a working column of the Sarayın Armed Hizmetler Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Savunma Ödeneği Alt Committee, compiled by the presidents of the Republican council, found that there was "a bitter disagreement" among intelligence analysts of the Central Committee, who said that the American forces of the United States had changed the Islamic State's assessment.
Merkezi Command, also known as Centcom, is a military headquarters located in Tampa, Fla., that oversees American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
A news bulletin about the report stated: "The intelligence results confirmed by the leaders of the Kıdemli Centcom typically paint a more positive picture than the facts in the field of US counterterrorism work show and consistently yield much more positive results than the analyses made by other elements of the intelligence community".
California Republican Temsilci Ken Calvert said, "What happened at Centcom is unacceptable; our fighter units are suffering from poor analysts and high-level decision-makers".
The leadership failures at Centcom have reached the highest levels of the organization.
The 10-page report, which includes the Central Committee's explanation and analysis of the U.S. training efforts for Iraqi forces, details the ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no clear evidence that senior Obama administration officials have issued a verdict in favor of falsifying reports, analysts are reportedly feeling pressure from Centcom leaders to give a better view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, known as ISIS and Daesh.
The report notes that "in the first half of 2015, many of the newsletters, reports and congress reports of the Central Commune were significantly more positive than the events".
For example, a Centcom official has openly stated that a major military offensive to retake the Muslims could be carried out as early as Nisan or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
Republican Kansas State Representative Mike Pompeo said in a statement that "after months of research, this issue has been quite clearly understood".
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, senior intelligence leaders of the United States Central Command manipulated the intelligence results of the command to make it appear as if the Tehdidin formed by ISIS were being launched in Iraq.
Republicans formed a study group after learning that analysts had expressed concerns that intelligence on Islam Devleti was being manipulated.
As the news continues, the report, published on Thursday, will be followed by much more comprehensive bulletins.
Another Centcom intelligence agency, run by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence, is investigating the situation.
The Saray İstihbarat Committee of the Democratic Committee of the People's Republic of China on Friday published its own bulletins, which included some of the conclusions reached by the Cumhuriyetçi column.
In a statement, Temsilci Adam B. Schiff, chairman of the Democratic Committee, said: "Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom, DAEŞ and the Iraqi Security Forces had a highly detailed intelligence assessment process".
According to Baytr Schiff, this process "has delayed the publication of intelligence results", led to moral decay among analysts, and "haven given enough room for disagreements".
However, Bay Schiff and Democrats have stated that they have not reached a consensus on the results of Beyaz Saray's Centcom analysts' pressure on the "predetermined or political narrative" of the fabrication.
The preliminary results of the congressional inquiry were announced by the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported that a Pentagon inspector who had opened a complaint by Centcom analysts had reported that a general investigation was in progress.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that he would not comment on the Department of Defense report during the ongoing inspection.
But he himself said that "people may disagree in some cases on the interpretation of complex truths, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense support a healthy dialogue on these important national security issues".
The research will shed light on the fact that the US-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria have not yet been carried out (a fact that has been revealed by more security officials in recent days).
But last year's allegations revealed the extent to which President Obama could rely on the Central Committee for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Critics of the Islamic State's coverage of intelligence began when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote an article that, despite the objections of many analysts, President George W. Bush's administration advocated a small force-building in Iraq and expressed a lack of consideration for the aftermath of the 2003 invasion, which has been debated for decades.
Bay Hooker, also an Islamist, played a significant role in the events surrounding the Islamic State intelligence.
Yettrkililer, despite the public statements made by Bay Hooker's team last year, said that the airstrikes on the nearby refineries held by Islam Devleti had resulted in a significant disruption to the terrorist group's financial resources, as airstrikes on the nearby refineries had built temporary refineries to supply oil.
But as The Times reported in September, this bulge has not been outside the Central Committee.
Last year, the Senate announcement by former Centcom commander General Lloyd J. Austin III was criticized by critics because it was seen by many lawmakers as a highly positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in Nisan and was succeeded by General Joseph L. Votel of the Merkezi Commune.
The United States Women's Team, the Kim Hokeyi Team, is preparing for a deal with Britain.
Katie Bam, a day after scoring three goals in her 6-1 victory over Japan, scored the first two goals for the United States women's national ice hockey team in a 3-0 win over India on Thursday.
Two matches and five goals, and a lasting skill that seems to be the guiding principle, Bam (27) said he was not sure he had done the same thing before.
"Hiçbirtr fikrim yok", said Kendisi.
I'm not one of those people who keeps the record of the Goltrins.
The result is this: The Americans share a 4-0 lead in the Olympic tournament and a first place finish in the group with the British, who are still on the road, as a defeat to Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will face off on Saturday for their first ever home-and-away match.
The two teams qualified for the quarter-finals, and the six-team group match will decide who finishes first and second.
The first team to beat the group matches, the quarter-finalists, will not face the strong Dutch team, which will be led by another group, for a little longer.
But after Saturday's game, the Americans, the last of the 12 teams, made a sensation by showing surprising progress here after the London Olympics.
Bamtr was a team.
Kendisi grew up in Blue Bell, Pa.'tr; she was 3 years old when she first picked up her ice hockey soup (which was also her dream) and at 16 she joined the national team and became the team's youngest player.
Sontr kadroya missed the 2008 Olympics for his gymnastics career.
Then came 2012 when most things didn't go well for him and his teammates.
The following year, a British coach, Craig Parnham, was brought in and things began to change.
Bam says, "Cultural change, mental change, physical change".
We are no longer working like in London.
Tamtramen has been transformed into a gate.
On Thursday night, Bam, the first of the first boys, took the first master's thumbs up with a very close-knit bir vuruş.
India had not yet gained a single victory in the tournament, but the team showed an amazing level of resilience and managed to score 1-0 to the third quarter, where Bam'in devreye entered.
He made a long run from the bench and then turned the ball over and beat the Americans 2-0.
Melissa Gonzales, who scored the game-winning goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
This was the first of three consecutive victorious goals allowed by United States goaltender Jackie Briggs, who scored the first goal of the tournament.
The train has been opened.
Bam'trin is so.
Parnham said, "We're in a good place", but how good it is on Saturday depends on the score.
Trambolin Coldplay in the middle of the Olympic Games
Wherever you are, no matter what the time, the Olympics are going on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro represent a fierce competition and a struggle that will never be stopped or avoided.
The Olympic Games itself is a hundredth, gymnastics or triathlon, and it is delivered as a bir alevli baton.
Without hearing about the quarrel between Simone Biles, Katie Ledetrcky or Michael Phelps and Chad and Clos, you don't watch TV, read newspapers, or listen to a coffee shop spokesman.
Logan Dooley will be on the show.
A heartbeat like a swimmer, gymnast or skater can be one of the ads shown during prime time between sponsors, first-time Olympian Bay Dooley and TV commercials that make you feel good.
However, Lake Forest, California's Bay Dooley (28) is struggling for a gold medal in trampolining at the Olympics.
The Olympic Games are not evenly illuminating their event.
Merkezden disttrta, partly known as the shadow universal, is a sport that includes rifle shooting, okçuluk, badminton, tekvando.
We will always be in a constant state of flux, as long as we wish it to be.
But if I have to say that I personally prefer it, I would like to draw attention to the secret magic of trambolin.
Although trambolin has been known as an Olympic event since it was introduced at the Sydney Games in 2000, few people I've seen over the past 16 years have realized that it is an Olympic sport.
This could be a regional beer cehalettr.
The United States of America, the nation's top trampoline athlete, has never won a medal for the event, and until 2012 there were no finalists.
The male winners were Chinese and Russians, while the female winners were Chinese and Canadians.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will be competing for the gold medals they won in London this year.
However, trambolin adeta mazlum is being noted as an activity; this may be partly because of the idea that clown schooling is appropriate in unconscious ears instead of the Olympics.
I must admit I am not an expert here, just a konuya ilgtrim var.
Comic has potential (as in the cartoon benzeri titreme created by the soundless figure) but it is always a combination of the two sports of gymnastics and travel.
"Trambolin" comes from the word trampolin in Spanish; it means "tramplen".
The champion candidates jump almost 30 feet in the air in a large trampoline and are expected to make a series of movements (burkma, pike and jump) before jumping on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated according to icra, zorluk and "flight speed".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, including 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The progress often seen at the Olympics is directly ahead.
In the quest for gold, Madtralya must climb to the finish, sometimes backwards, sometimes upwards, downwards, and upwards, faster and higher.
Not only are the lines of the finish line or the start of the race behind them, but there are other lines of the race on television; world or Olympic records.
This determined effort is effective, inexpensive and even extreme; enough to drown a viewer and tears.
However, this is one of the few features I have found in the game that is not Yorucu.
Trambolin, which is a good remedy for the pain of the stomach.
The trambolindekiler is moving upwards.
Htredefleri is not a forward movement.
He jumped upwards, appeared weightless as an astronaut, climbed upwards, downwards, and again upward.
Of course, there is no competition or difficulty, but since routine surresistance, there is no effort to reach a result, no distance or loss, just the graceful questioning of time and space, as imagined.
The coldest Olympic Games can be the coldest.
The women's qualifiers and the final will be held on Friday afternoon at 13.00 Eastern time; the men's on Saturday again at 13.00.
NBC, on its two-day final, will broadcast the afternoon block starting at 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they are eating a very sexy and wonderful dish that can be ignored in general.
And knowing that the United States will only be a male athlete for eye-sniffing and grooming, as recently suggested by male gymnasts, we can say that Baytr Dooley is expecting new fans.
Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States, has been the target of a "Bir Nesil Protest".
Ethiopia's violence is a result of protests.
Ethiopia's demand for political change was met with a violent crackdown by the government.
The witness, who says he was given a deadly weapon by the darbeleri in a series of clashes between protesters and police.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
In the past decade, it has been a strong ally of one of Africa's most stable nations and the fastest growing economy in the West.
But the anti-government protests of recent months have shaken the country, spreading more territory over the past day.
Last week alone, thousands of people took to the streets to demand fundamental political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response to this was quite brutal.
The witness said police officers had assaulted and killed numerous unarmed protesters.
Images of protests, thought to have taken place late last year or early this year, show security officials beating teenagers who have been forced to put their hands against a wall.
A high-level UN human rights commissioner is now calling for a detailed investigation.
Rashid Abdi, project director of the Somali Peninsula Project of the International Crisis Group, a research group, said: "Taking this country together has always been difficult and it will be much harder to move forward".
Africa's population is among the highest in the world, after Ethiopia, Nigeria and is valued by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services, especially Somalia, are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, and there are few countries in Africa that have received such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is growing at an impressive rate.
The infrastructure has been improved effectively; new suburban trains are now available in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are generally smooth, safe and clean.
While Ethiopia's democracy was exemplary in that the country's muhalefet was quite limited (human rights groups have consistently been accused of oppressing the government), the muhalifler was effectively suppressed.
Most were exiled, imprisoned, killed or driven to remote corners of the desert.
But this may be about to change.
"If you beat people and give them no choice but to protest, these things will happen", said Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer from central Ethiopia.
Gentrçlik is completely protesting.
One generation of protesters.
There are many complaints about Arazi's use of force, including the repression of the Iktidaraki coalition.
After the elections in the highly elected areas last year, the ruling parties and their allies took the seats filled by the opposition and now controlled 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, in June, the number of guerrilla fighters on the border with Eritrea, a civil and conflict-ridden country, increased, causing hundreds of casualties.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Ötrzgürlük Cephesi or Ogaden Ulusal Özgürlük Cephesi, which have disappeared in recent years, will use this turbulence to rearm and rearm.
There are several factors that explain why the painful feelings that have been lurking beneath the surface for years are now exploding.
The three-pointed star appears: smartphones.
As smartphones became more widespread and internet access became available, only a few years ago a large number of Ethiopians began communicating using social media.
When the government shut down Facebook and Twitter, especially during protests, most people were still communicating via internet representative servers that concealed their location.
Several young Ethiopians said they had gathered in this way to protest.
Second, there has been increased cooperation between Ethiopia's two major ethnic groups, Oromolar and Amharalar.
Oromolar and Amharalar are not normally Mutefik.
For a very long time, the Amharalar have been leading politics and business in the Christian-majority mountainous regions of Ethiopia, exploiting the mostly Muslim, plain-farming Oromo people.
But that situation is changing.
Mulatu Gemechu, leader of Bir Oromo, said: "We are coming together under one umbrella and moving forward towards greater cooperation".
A large protest was held in Amhara and Oromo regions.
Most Amhara and Oromo people in Ethiopia, who make up about 6 percent of the population, believe that they are unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which is dominated by the army, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of the tragedy was the death of Meles Zenawi.
Former rebel leader Baytr Meles served as Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012 from an undisclosed illness.
Seeing what everyone could not do, he thought it was a tactical feat.
An analyst says he is especially skilled at detecting the first signs of anxiety and testing and sterilizing the counterparts.
"The Mevcut regime does not have this basic knowledge", said Baytr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn was elected in relative uncertainty to fill the seat of Bay Meles.
Bay Meles'in, which comes from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, is the opposite, Bay Hailemariam is southern.
Analisttrler says he does not believe the security services controlled by the Tigrays are trustworthy.
As a result, more fear and more blood was spilled.
Ethiopia's latest experience of such a mess was in 2005 after thousands of analysts protested the thefts by the government after a snap election.
In the ensuing measures, even though less than a month ago, many protesters were killed, and the turmoil period passed relatively quickly.
Experts in the field of urban planning praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure plans such as the new suburban train and the significant progress made in the fight against poverty.
But this clearly did not stop the Chinese government from waging war against the Ethiopian government.
This is a dangerous and ethnically dangerous situation.
Last month, a protest group in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by Tigrayan people, and the hatred of Tigrayan people has been on the rise on social media.
An analyst says the protests have left the United States and other allies in the West in a state of chaos.
The US government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia; however, it was recently reported that this base had been closed.
But clearly, we support democracy and do not want this alliance to be torn apart in a region that is already fragile.
"Bu", said Bay Abdi, exclaiming "it's like walking on a very thin iptr".
Donald Trump described Obama's claim to the establishment of ISIS as "alaycılık".
Donald J. Trump, on Friday, repeatedly insisted last week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "guards" of the Islamic State terrorist group, but tried to eliminate the conflict surrounding the campaign by insisting that it was not serious.
This announcement has generated new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate openly with the American people.
At the same time, the rioters have been trying to explain the statement that they are not doing this to their representatives who have been preventing them from defending him in this tumultuous process.
Mr. Trump, after he raised the issue at a rally on Thursday night, insisted in interviews that Mr. and Mrs. Clinton actually had ISIS as a Kurdish nation.
But in a tweet early Friday morning, Mr. Trump said he had only made a mocking statement.
Gönderi, the day before Mr Trump's series of interviews showed that he was taking a complete step back from the day he said he was serious about the charge.
Muhafazakar radio broadcaster Hugh Hewitt reminded Bay Obama that he wanted to destroy ISIS, and when he denied that Bay Trump was helping him in this way, Republican President Aday said he did not believe it.
Bay Trump, after the fall of the Anketlertr, was trying to change the course of his campaign, but his karma came to light.
Trump and Clinton held conflicting talks about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Mr. Trump wanted to return to the convent.
Speaking again on Twitter, Tristram said that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would increase the barrier and that her speech would be boring.
Mr. Trump has used the defense of ridicule before.
Towards the end of July, after meeting with major critics after showing a video suggesting that the Russians had hacked Ms. Clinton's emails, he made the comments, saying, "Of course I said this in a derogatory way".
This approach allows Mr. Trump to push the boundaries of political discourse and take a step back where it should.
Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who tracks the language of both candidates, said: "It is a system that allows certain messages to be "expressed" in a way that depends on the response, by testing how certain messages are perceived by those who support them".
But at the same time, he gives these statements in a blurry way and knows that when mixed with different ingredients, they are too vague to be filtered.
After a recent decline in polls, Mr. Trump has a much more aggressive tutum for the general election than the yumuşatmak.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll published on Friday showed that Bay Trump is in the back seat of Mrs. Clinton in North Coraline, Virginia and Colorado, and that there is a tight race in Florida.
Her husband, Mr. Trump, has often accused him of avoiding apologizing for the provocative things he says and of misrepresenting his critics or misunderstanding their humor.
But the jokes of Mr. Trump, who have been subjected to much more scrutiny in recent months of his presidential campaign, leave his loyal supporters in a difficult position to learn how to support him, even though his comments are provocative.
Former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Bay Trump's outspoken supporters, made a defensive defense in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
When asked about the validity of the thesis that Bay Trump, Baytr Obama and Mrs Clinton were founding the Islamic State, Bay Giuliani said, "Bence is a legitimate, political critic".
In a sense, before Obama, ISIS was an unknown, small organization, their favorite moon was completely wrong and it was because of the withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Many of the Republicans who have emerged are trying to argue that the Obama administration, which is Mrs. Clinton's foreign secretary, has failed to deal aggressively with the situation in the Middle East and has contributed to the growth of ISIS.
In the run-up to Friday's rally in Pennsylvania, Trump continues to accuse the news media on Twitter of twisting every word and acting biased against it.
"Bunu yapamazlar!" he said, mockingly to the "trvallı, acınası" television experts who were trying to solve himself.
Some Democrats derided Mr. Trump's excuse, saying it was a reason he was unfit for the presidency.
Bir Zamanla with prices Baştremeyen Edemeyen Coffee Greenpoint'te Yeniden Bizimle
The Verb Cafe, an old cash-only coffee shop in Williamsburg, had a Wi-Fi connection and served a great coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the store on Bedford Avenue was overwhelmed by prices.
In the summer of 2014, the shop that replaced Verb'üntr sold soap in the form of a soap cake called Soap Cherie.
The inhabitants of the region were convinced that this was a loss of life for the planned city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: "New York is a change, I know that, but I still can't believe that CBGB is gone and Chelsea Hotel has been evacuated and Verb'ün is no longer a soap shop".
Or New York City as a city of change.
Last November, Greentrpoint'te, less than a mile from its original location, opened a renovated Verb Cafe.
Yeni Verb Cafe has Wi-Fi connectivity and accepts credit cards, but retains some of its old employees and similar simple amenities.
Kahtrve de halen is good.
At the beginning of the new year, the longtime employee of the former cafe, Cisco Rodriguez, is the new owner and general manager.
Kendisi was diagnosed with Verb'tre in 2001 and passed away in 2001.
One client of TR said that when he was offered financing for this new location, he would be excited to do so.
Baytr Rodriguez (36), left most of the same.
Verbtr, using the same distributor for the simitler, and purchased the same model of espresso machine.
Even the old Verb'ün lights were reused here.
However, Bay Rodriguez, a bit of an experienced diver, said he wanted to make a change.
The new malzemeler is coming.
Pastırmalı-yumurtalı-ve-peynirli sandwiçler menu is available and is available in capari and sotelenmiş soğan as well as sunlight sandwiches.
Esmer-pirinç castreri were also used.
Coffee no longer serves beer but rather fresh fruit juices.
Nine months later, Baytr Rodriguez said he noticed that the former defenders were beginning to come firmly.
"Many of our former clients in Williamsburg are in trouble with prices", said Kendisi.
Last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira and a few other clients came by.
Oliveira (34) lived in Williamsburg and Verb'e was a frequent visitor.
After moving to Greenpoint, he never gave up on his journey.
After taking the verb, he said he refused to drink coffee for a while.
"I realized that my favorite thing was the coffee and culture in the Verb", she said.
He started drinking coffee again, but the other day he chose a tea blend with a new ingredient instead of the usual iced coffee.
Another member, Tom Rostrenthal, has been a regular member of Verb'e since 2003.
He goes there first and always places the same order.
"Every day, every quarter, I would walk in without any hesitation and prepare my daily tereyağlı simit siparişimi", she said.
Bay Rodriguez said he wanted to make changes and added new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays, Bay Rosenthal is still making some changes to her old recipe, although she is also making some changes to her current recipe by adding pasta, eggs and peynir.
Bay Rodriguez said the shop that replaced the old machine was not attached to the soap store.
As a matter of fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb using caffeinated, cold-smelted coffee.
"I'm sure we can accept this offer", Bay Rodriguez said.
The traditional Greenpoint'in Vetr Greenpoint is a coffee drink enjoyed by Polish residents.
New customers from Lehçeye translated the menu into English, and Bay Rodriguez said he would soon open an area to display the menu so that his new neighbors would feel better.
There are other advantages to the new system.
Yerel wants a fruit juice store, cold-smelled coffee shops, and satmak.
Caffeine bites are likely to spread to the skin.
For most customers, having a new Verb'un available where they can find their old favorites is enough.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and was very sad when the shop closed.
When the new venue opened, Baytr Whitt stepped in and said the coffee was a stir.
"I needed to get my bunny koklam", she said.
The Depressing Food of the Crisis in the book "A Square Meal".
In March 1933, shortly after the presidential session, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch at the Oval Office.
President Roosevelt, a voracious buffalo, enjoyed the sweet Fifth Avenue foods such as kaz ciğeri orange and Maryland turtle soup.
The menu is much more modest: tomatoes with scrambled eggs, potatoes pure and sweet and old erikli pudding.
Jane Ziegelman said, "Butr, an initiative to build solidarity with those who suffer from food insecurity".
Andrew Coe, his wife, added: "It's also a message to Americans about how to eat".
They're a couple who live in Brooklyn Heights, and they're a food historian.
Bay Coe's son's book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in America and in his book Bayan Ziegelman and the "97 Orchard" he described life on the geek condo in the Lower East Side through food.
Their new book, "A Square Meal", which they are working on together and will be published by Harper's on Tuesday, tells the story of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
Since 1929 when the crisis began, they have been showing solidarity with themselves in the food industry, and have been meeting a reporter for dinner at the Eisenberg Sandwich Buffet in Flatiron.
After Ziegelman (54), kremtr peynirli and olive sandwiç sipariş ederken, Bay Coe (57), Hindi, preferred to eat pure potatoes and sebze.
Couple, the hostess rolls the purchase of siparişini suitable for discussion of the crisis period meals.
"Somtrunlar was very popular", said Bayan Ziegelman.
There was groundnut soybean, lung soybean, and old bean soybean.
These were made of a cheap piece of furniture.
Imagine that you ate a whole lot of peanuts for dinner.
Bay Coe, your face is out.
"It must be in the middle of a man's body like a bullet", he said.
In the years before the crisis, sofas in America, especially in rural areas, were like open buffets.
Women cook for men who work on the farm and serve freshly baked cakes for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Americans sent food to Europeans starving during World War I. "A Square Meal", explains the history of the methods of dealing with the problem of the island suddenly becoming a center of mass.
Bay Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about the subject, said, "This was a time when food became a central, worrying concern for Americans".
The new budgetary regime was equally rewarding: fatty foods such as somunlar and güvehller became the main consumer product, according to Bayan Ziegelman, "a good way for the guvehller to evaluate the food" so that cooks could hide a cream sauce cap and an alttaaki appetite suppressant.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Over the years, it has become a luxury beer, which has been at the center of American cuisine and is paid for in a lavish manner.
Interesting mixtures for calorie and brass value led to the concept of denendi and doyum hissi tat or general cooking.
After Ziegelman, while researching the book of contents, he prepared a soybean meal in a bakery with peanut butter.
Baytr Coe said, "This dinner was not a very popular addition to the menu".
Ziegelman later confirmed this: "This is incredibly realistic".
Peanut butter has nothing in common with soya.
In most economies, tariffs are a feature of this.
From 1923 to 1943, economists, including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Economics, guided the country's eating habits like never before.
Tariff and articles in newspapers and magazines encouraged women to become "tasarruflu" and spread the fight to turn spices such as havuçlu cream spaghetti into delicious foods.
"A Square Meal" is a history of bir ziyafet with leziz lokma.
President Herbert Hoover's responses to governmental sentences to hungry citizens like his leftist pastry are highly appetizing.
Kennedy, on the other hand, abandoned the simple Iowa farmer's meals of his childhood as a wealthy man, while on the other hand, he ate like a millionaire intellectual.
Bay Coe, "Salatalık soslu balık is a European cuisine delicacy that I have never tasted", he said.
Dressing in a cake that suits dinner, he ate his meals almost entirely in a dining room with a golden capsule.
It was very far from reality.
If Eleanor, his wife, had not encouraged him to set an example, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
According to the book, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a little-known assistant to fill the White House with "not only the crunchy foods, but also the crunchy tobacco", which had been prepared so far.
After Ültrke got back on his feet, most of the crisis-era methods of food-yapping were abandoned.
According to Ziegelman, the concept of calorie and nutrition and the science of cooking continues to be applied.
The couple, while writing the book, said they learned a lot from Ms Ziegelman's cousin's eating habits - for example, she never brought food to the trash.
Bay Coe said "Yiyecektr israfı really scared him".
After Ziegelman, he mentioned ancient monuments: "It really hurt people".
He had a cremated cake vacation.
After Eisenberg's tobacco sales were over, he and Bay Coe took out a homemade dessert: President Roosevelt's old Ericki dessert at lunch.
Bayan Ziegelman "Buna çırpılmış kuru erik deniyor" said and he added a frequent number, which is a modest fare.
There was no whipped cream; only kuru erik, some un, sugar, su ve tarçın.
Everyone shook their hands with a spoonful of sticky broomsticks.
Surprisingly, it wasn't too bad.
Bay Coe, took the second and third cups.
"A piece of chopped garlic would be good", said a man who could have been a bear.
Mertrck and Hepatitis C patent battles will see Gilead's attorney pay the salaries.
According to a decision by a U.S. district judge, Gilead Sciences Inc., a pharmaceutical manufacturer, won the rights to the attorney fees for a patent lawsuit against hepatitis C manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
After finding that U.S. District Judge Merck'in had engaged in a series of misconduct involving false testimony and other unethical practices, Gilead was awarded $200 million in damages in June for the infringement of two Merck patents on its highly successful drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, which Gilead had been working on.
U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman testified Thursday at the trial that she was entitled to compensation for salaries incurred during Gilead's defense.
Merck is trying to catch up with the market leader, Gilead, with the next generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of liver patients.
Dava, Gilead and Merck'in filed a lawsuit against each other in 2013 claiming ownership of laboratory studies for the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs, sofosbuvir.
The US military chief, destekli kuvvetler, said that the control of Membiç'in was completely taken over by the Islamic State.
On Friday, the group's spokesman, a US-based militant, said that the Islamic State militants inside the city had completely taken control of Membiç, located near the Turkish border.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG) is clearing the city after a group of militants who have studied and are stored in the city were dispersed.
Sharfan Derviş, a member of the Membiç Military Council, said that the group had released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by militants.
Kendisi told Routers "We have now completely controlled the city but are carrying out clean-up work".
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of federal taxes.
Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for President, on Friday released a 2015 tax return showing that she and her husband earned $10.75 million last year and paid 34.2 percent of the federal income tax they had in force.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, most of them the Clinton Foundation, earned about $5.3 million from former President Bill Clinton's speech fees, and reported earning $3 million for a book by Simon & Schuster about his time at the former State Department.
Clinton's running mate, the U.S. Senator from Virginia, Tim Kaine, and his wife Anne Holton, released a 10-year tax return.
In 2015, 20.3 percent of federal taxpayers paid $20.3 billion in federal income taxes.
Clinton campaign manager Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement, "Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency".
On the contrary, Donald Trump is hiding behind false information about the disclosure of previous tax returns and stepping back.
It is a tradition for US presidential candidates to publicly file their tax returns.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers said the reasons for the release of the statements were a "genetime investigation" by the Gelirtresi Administration.
In connection with the Democratic candidate's statements, Clinton campaign manager Ian Sams tweeted "Sıra sizde".
On Thursday, Trump's private prosecutor Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to broadcast them until the investigation was complete.
In 2012, a group of critics of Trump, including Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, said that this "redemptive" situation posed questions about many other connections, including his own identity, contributions to charitable organizations, business deals, and those with Russia.
Clinton, on Friday, posted an online video showing senior Republicans pressuring Trump to declare his taxes and went on to address the situation.
He expressed this concern during an economic talk in Michigan on Thursday.
"For decades, she has been renouncing doing what her presidential candidate has done, publishing tax returns", Kendisi told the newspaper.
Politico reported that Trump paid almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and on Friday, a columnist for the New York Times Business Section shared comments from a number of tax attorneys and accountants about how the situation could continue in this way.
Federal tax rates have become a major issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has proposed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffet, who would provide at least 30 percent of the income of those earning more than $1 million a year with taxpayer dollars.
President Obama has made this proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, the Berkshire Hathaway group challenged Buffett, who operated there, to challenge Trump's appearance and filing of the tax return.
Buffet said he was undergoing IRS scrutiny and was "corking" from voters, not Trump's tax code.
Clinton, in her campaign, published tax returns up to 2007.
The Clintons, who currently live in Chappaqua, New York, paid about 32 percent of the federal average tax between 2007 and 2014, and the combined tax rate is about 40.5 percent.
The Clinton family's 2015 statement shows that, unlike most Americans, their income comes from wages of only $100.
Ana's investments are a low-value index investment fund and the Clinton family have reported a $109,000 interest income.

Toz red pepper condoms, chestnut fishes, and Tanzanian pepper are a major contributor to the coronation of the fillings.
Environmentalists in Tanzania are using a common method to prevent fillers from entering human settlements; they throw red pepper-filled condoms at them.
The idea proved effective in the past, and a few years ago the Honeyguide Foundation and the US-based Nature Conservancy Association took a step forward to promote it; in rural areas in northern Tanzania, volunteers began training their homes and crops to use the non-violent, four-step method of killing animals without harm.
In the past, most people used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Filter Day, a day dedicated to animal cruelty.
"As we have developed the Araç set, we have seen the attitude in these communities change; now we are more confident that the fillers can keep the land from being damaged by the red fillers", said Damian Bell, Honeyguide's executive director in a statement.
The first two steps, the past filetrener, include turning on the fener and playing the corna.
Where this is not possible, the so-called "red pepper cloud" is thrown.
Toprakla is mixed with powdered red pepper, a keg of chestnut beer or condoms, only the four open and the nose closed.
When the condom is burned, a patch of beer is opened and the air dust is sprinkled on the red pepper.
One breath is enough to send the filling in the direction of action.
Sontr çare is the use of a flashlight that causes flashes, loud noises, flashes and explosions.
A Jewish filmmaker, Arabtrup, has been shot dead at a Berlin hotel after Israel's phone number was lifted over the "telephone" of Arabs - RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish descent, Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, caused a sensation in the media after revealing that the Israeli phone number was being listed and that the employee was driving "taleplas" of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, one of the authors of the Belgian book "Shoah" on Soykırım, wrote an open letter to the German broadcaster FAZ expressing his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin.
Lanzmann, a few days earlier, tried to find Israel in the list of telephone codes provided by the hotel.
However, the country was not among the states that could directly enter the area.
In 2016, how can Israel, the new German capital of Berlin, be left out and destroyed?
It was written by Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinski is offering a call option through its own call center in Bristol, Israel.
The filmmaker reported the situation to the hotel reception to get an explanation.
Lanzmann wrote that his response "shocked him".
The hotel secretary said the event was being held under the "Casual Decision of the Management of Kempinski-Hotels".
This move, which was underlying the film industry, made the filmmaker even more nervous.
According to Lanzmann, the employee said, "Many of our contractors have been demanding that the Arab and Israeli codes be deleted".
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung'un haberin, the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, described the situation as "a great shame".
This was a shock and a shock to life.
This is a real shame.
The fact that this happened in Germany and in a chain of hotels like this is a much bigger draw.
This does not need to be explained.
We expect Otrin to draw the necessary conclusions from this", the official said.
Otrlay, online, has sparked a huge reaction; people have described the situation as scandalous.
Some accused the so-called demands of the Kempinski Hotel Arap's customers of "boyun eğmekle".
Another sign, located near a synagogue in the hotel, on Kurfurstendamm street, had the inscription "You must go".
According to Der Spiegel's report, the hotel quickly denied the accusations, saying that the incident was the result of "disregard" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann.
Suddeutsche Zeitung reported that one of Kempinski's representatives said "there has never been a direct emir to include Israel in the list of fast-calling".
Vetr indicated that they had now added the code.
Police, Brazilian protesters, and students used pepper and plastic bullets against the Brazilian protesters.
Students gathered in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday to protest against the government's reforms of the public education system clashed with police.
Police, protesters, and protesters used pepper spray and plastic ammunition.
In the early days, the school officials began distributing students, which led to the use of plastic bombs and pepper spray by the police.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration to express their displeasure with the plantation workers.
According to the verdict of Geraldo Alckmin, the Sao Paulo suitcase will be closed to save 100 public schools and 300,000 students will be sent to other schools.
Some of the protesters were seen writing on the walls of the country's interim president, Michel Temer, about the protests.
The protest took place a few days after the country's senators took to the streets in a mass demonstration to support the ousted President Dilma Rousseff.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71 percent. - RT Business

Büyüktrelçi, since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, said that the interest of Russian companies doing business in the country has increased dramatically.
While new companies are preparing to provide access to the market, Russian companies are maintaining existing ties with Iran.
Of course, the further growth of trade is one of the priorities of our bilateral cooperation with Iran", Dzhagartryan said.
In the first five months of 2016, the trade deficit between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015, reaching $856 million, he said.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran reached $697 million, or 91.5 percent of the total.
Russia's imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The ticket was provided with equipment for the transportation of weapons, machinery, land vehicles and equipment", Elçi said.
Dzhagartryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Embassy in Iran issued 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of them for travel.
In addition, Iran was among the top 20 countries in the list of tourists who visited Russia for the first time.
We can say that the record of Iranian tourists visiting Russia last year will be broken".
At the same time, relatively fewer Russians visit Iran; this is a topic that is also changing.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yezd, where the relics of ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition", he said.

Expressing that the meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin excites the tourism sector as well as the trade sectors between the two countries, Kızıldağ said, "I expect that tourism, both in terms of production and textiles, will be very positive developments in all sectors".
Turkey and Russia are two very close countries, with long-standing traditional relations.
"As a sector, we are making very rapid progress on this path that has been opened by the leaders of the two countries, and I think we can close the gaps and move towards our goals if we do so quickly", he said.
Kızıltrdağ, who estimated that the number of Russian tourists arriving in Turkey would exceed 1 million if there were no Darbe attempt, continued:
We lost a month of what we called the high season, so the goal is down.
I still think that if charter flights start, we will exceed 500 billion.
There may be a season extension from the end of the first quarter to mid-June.
In such a situation, flights can be scheduled for the new year.
I imagine this positive sentiment will be well appreciated by the Russian people.
They have a lot of hatred for Turkey.
I think that this is why I think we might be able to make 700 bucks.
Expressing their optimism for the Russian market in 2017, Kızıldağ said that if the relations between the two countries and the Russian economy recovered, the number of Russian tourists could once again exceed 3 million next year.
Poyd President Kızıldağ said that with the lifting of the ban on Kamu personnel, domestic reservations began to decline, "On cancelled reservations, there were again rollovers, new reservations and reservations began to be received".
"We have a lot of expectations about Kurban Bayramı", he said.
Kıztrıldağ, after the coup attempt, said that the lifting of the travel ban on travel agencies by Iran after the coup attempt was a very positive development, saying, "It would be very good if we could bring 100-200 thousand people from Iran by 1.2-2 May".

Hüseyin Gülerce, who interpreted FETÖ's coup attempt, made striking remarks.
Hüseyin Güler's comments are summarized as follows:
As I thought about the Darbeye strike, I wrote about this issue in my posts over the past 5-6 months: "They can make a mess but they can't do it in a chain of command".
I knew two things; the fact that this type of printing was widespread and profound, for example, the eight-year-old emir subay of the Jandarma General Command and the yaverleri of the President.
Mr. President, the most struggling person, perhaps, is the one who has been careful in choosing his yavers, or perhaps the most important of these is an unprecedented secrecy.
It's a lot more of a facelift.
One of the important proofs of the phrase "This is not something a retired professional like FETÖ can do" is that it is such a deep compass.
The CIA's support is not available.
CIA, this guy is very well known in the '60s.
Mahmut Övür 2014'te says that 1971'de Vehbi Koç'un event Fuat Doğu le Fetullah Gülen was mettüler.
Many of those involved in these activities describe the period as a time when the relationship between MIT and the CIA was close.
Our armed kuvvettr personnel were paid by the US, but after not remembering these, a man came out and said this.
We're always learning that from 2014.
After Mahtrut Bey'in wrote this, there was no statement to deny it.
Miss Adil Ökstrüz, you are a great girl, aren't you?
Kimtr bu is curious.
Adam had been to Pennsylvania twice in 25 days, and returned two days ago.
Adtril Öksüz has been abroad 109 times since 2002.
When you put all this together, this needs to be investigated; now all the fugitives have been in the United States since the March 1999 flight of Fetullah Gülen to the United States under one pretext.
It is clear that they have gone to Pennsylvania.
Either the CIA's original relationship with the CIA can be determined here; especially from people who needed to be promoted from the security ranks, there were many people sent to the United States in security.
Wikileaks has been in the news; Gülen is a member of a group that is working with the CIA in joint meetings.
Fifteen years ago, work was done to officially establish the CIA's links to the CIA.
Fuat Avni in Pennsylvania's Bir Intelligence has said that havuzudur was two years ago.
Adam Fuat Avni'ye, who works at the Prime Minister's office, is employed.
Or worse, the CIA has been hit with information about Pennsylvania.
The fall of Gülen is linked to the collapse of the three legs; the so-called bottom, which formed the friend ring, the deep hypnosis, the attempted coup and even the film of Erdoğan.
I was sleeping three feet, yes, one foot support.
Theft of the land, theft, theft of property, and theft of property were all very damaging to the base.
The other two are political support, international support.
International support is available.
The political support will be broken only by the fact that Baykal and the MHP's directors' tapes have been removed by FETÖ.
After July 15, "FETÖ"ytr Sayın Kılıçdaroğlu has been using it, opening everyone's eyes.
Gütrlen is a number one who says "I don't do well, I do around me".
He says beside me, "Yah Hüseyin Bey, this girl Taliban is having very different dreams, sending children, I have banned it, because it is not right to act with dreams".
A recording was dropped, or the recording speaker, Barbaros Kocakurt: "If you dream, double the tweets of our Prophet".
Nusaybin'de 1 police officer was martyred.
According to reports, the armoured caravan with police officers on duty at Selahaddin Eyyubi Mahallesi was shot down by terrorists with long-barreled guns.
The first door opened, killing a policeman and injuring a policeman.
The clashes over police retaliation resulted in the deaths of the two terrorists.
The injured police officer, Nusaybin Devlet Hastanesine, was removed.
Operation is underway in the area.
Darbecileri's efforts to stop TV broadcasting were not met.
On the night of 15 July, in anticipation of the coup attempt, the special television channels, Türksat'ta darbecilere, which were important payloads, continued to broadcast thanks to a technical staff led by heroic workers.
Here is the hero Astrım Akkaya...
Expressing her innermost thoughts about the psychology of the train with the instruction to cut the broadcast during the broadcast of the TRT'de notice, Akkaya said, "I faced everything thinking that my friends were martyrs at the helicopter launch".
They threw their guns away and cut off their publications.
I just turned off local TVs.
I then told them to go to the antennae and told them to stay away from the building.
I spent about 20 minutes in the antenna room.
"Once again, I bought some cables or didn't touch the materials", he said.
Darbeciler Türksat'taki was able to cut the broadcast after bringing in the experts of Samanyolu TV.
These terrorists were seized by police who arrived three minutes ago.
After Darbectriler returned to binaya about an hour later, Akkaya, who said that the phone call came to them and told them that their TV broadcasts were continuing, and that a deadly burning nose was coming, related his experiences:
I was working the night shift at 8 o'clock.
It is the time for us to emancipated ourselves.
My friend is a newbie for the e-devlet and electrical system.
We were about 9 p.m. to get a cup of tea and a helicopter flew by.
A few other aircraft were flying from the helicopter's side.
We saw their lights.
The image was probably taken by unmanned aerial vehicles.
Helicopters were flying in front of them.
I've been on the air for 11 years, and I've been looking for a flyer for the first time since I've seen one so close.
Then a movement began.
I learned in the news that the bakken bridge had been closed.
Our general manager has instructed friends who are not in the security or an intrude to come to our house.
As I was going to get information, I learned that all of their packages on TRT had dropped.
TRT broadcasts were suspended for 5 minutes.
I tried to find TRT but could not reach it.
Our control station told us that TRT broadcasts are back and the announcement is starting to be read.
Assistant General Manager Halitrl Yeşilçimen, on the instructions of the General Manager, requested the immediate cutting of TRT broadcasts.
Since TRT 3 broadcasts broadly on the channel, we started working to make it better.
We have just heard the Prime Minister Binalitr Yıldırım say 'talkışma var'.
Our manager's order to 'cut off' TRT is a bit of a psychological shock.
TRT'yi kestrik, a moment later we heard a helicopter sound.
We went outside, and as the helicopter hit her, everyone was dispersed.
We are back on the road with a little change.
Toptrlam is for 12 people.
As the helicopter went through, soldiers broke in.
A few of our friends were captured by soldiers.
We have come to this world not to leave them alone.
I saw our assistant general manager arrested and beaten to death.
Atrskerler were talking to each other.
'One tonesini of them is vuralım, korksuntrlar' said Bir.
Then the hepatic system is inserted into the ottrtular.
The commanders began to shout, 'Kim, in charge of this, I will not ask again.'
When we heard the 'Birini vuralım' style speeches, we thought: We have no news from the country or we have received a directive to'stop the TRT'.
So that means that there is a direct connection.
I felt like I was giving up my own life.
I said 'trim benim'.
I figured out what to do before I knew it.
The only thing I could think of was that my friends were shot from the helicopter.
I thought that 10-15 of my friends in Nizami were martyrs, and the thought of 'knowing they will eventually kill me' came to me with a relief.
The commander at their head said 'TRT will cut off all broadcasts.'
We have a system department that monitors the satellite extraction of earthquake channels.
We broadcast 80 tons of 200 local channels in a language-specific room.
The actresses were standing still.
There was no ulcerative colitis among them.
If I tell them that they are all dead, at least until the time when help from outside comes.
I said I'd go wherever he went.
We agreed that we would not leave Neticede.
I said, 'I'm going to stop the tram.'
We estimated the antenna output of one trillion tons of earthen channel packets.
We estimated the power button to the monitors that we could track through international channels.
This way, no signal will be displayed on all screens.
I told him I had to go to the antenna to get Tamtramen to be heard.
The commander of this army sent an antenna.
I opened the antenna door, the soldier said bir tanesi 'orda dur'.
The gun went off the rails.
'TRT tomorrow you will cut them all down, not one will be left, and I will finally shoot one of you, and you will be dead.'
Now that I've passed my grief, I said, 'You'll see it all come to pass,' and said nothing else.
The station girdik, oyalanarak local broadcasts are appreciated.
The other antennas are not.
In the next 20 years, a system of approximately 20 ulcerative ducts will be formed.
The earthquake cut through the canals and about 20 monitors were lost.
Rabbim helped us so much that we did not hesitate to answer him and tied their brains.
Our green answers were answered.
The publisher.
But life is easy.
After the antenna is removed, the trafontrun is replaced by a sordular.
I said, 'I don't know if I'm a TV broadcaster,' and he said, 'Do you have an electrician?'
I said, 'There will be no electricians after the evening messenger service, and if there is a breakdown, the team will come.'
In fact, there was a line of electricians.
I realized that I was interrupting the Cypriot publications.
I was thinking of cutting them up to distract the soldiers.
They were a little relieved to think that the publications were being cut off.
They were keen to pay the public.
Now the group has moved to wait.
About an hour later, when they turned on the TV in the waiting room, they saw A Haber.
Inside was a soldier.
'My comrade hasn't cut the A Haber's broadcast,' he said.
We're going to be looking at you.
'Thrayaga kalk,' he said.
I was calculated.
One soldier said, 'There are still publications.'
'There are channels that broadcast in Kıbrıs,' he said.
I said, 'They're broadcasting over Cyprus, we can't do anything to them.'
"Then, after a brief chat with the others, he lifted our heads up and walked", she said.
The Darbeciler Türksattr'tan minibuses escaped from the scene.
I saw from the photos that Beni was being carried to the toilet and executed by a soldier or a minibus.
Three times the gunmen fired shots at the forehead and the cheeks.
My friends also claimed that he was the same soldier.
At our house they were hitting us with the words 'evlat'.
Probably half a dozen who served in the military.
They may have inflicted a lot of pressure to get rid of him.
Asım Akkaya's comments indicate that Türksat's first police crime came from Gölbaşı.
When police teams learned that helicopters were surrounded, the security guards were calling, the policeman went to pick up the muhimmat.
Forty minutes later they came back.
When the police teams arrived, Turkstrat outside the city could not find anyone.
Akkaya reported that after only 3-4 minutes of police presence, so-called experts sent by Samtranyolu TV came to him, "They called the police teams 'we know inside, Türksat personalize, we need to get in urgently'".
"The police were out of the way and four of them suddenly took their phones and reported 'we were inside'", he said.

Poltrise yazık, devlete yazık.
Police officers are 20-25 days a week, no other work.
Noting that Turkey does not want Syria to return, Yıldırım said, "We need work, not work".

There have been several presidents like Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"Our efforts will not be enough", he said.

Ergenekon's eyes were on the compass, and FETÖ killed him.
Ankara Cumhuriyet Başsavcılığı, 2009 investigates the role of FETÖ in the mysterious death of the head of the Special Harekat Department, Behçet Oktay, whose file was closed as "İntihar etti".
Oktay'la studied at the same school and six days before Oktay's death, he was interrogated by former Emniyet Intelligence Director Ramazan Akyürek, the prime suspect in the investigation, under the false name of Hizbullah Terrorism Organisation suspect.
It is believed that some of the ammunition seized in the Ergenekon investigation was stolen and buried by the FETÖ security team from the Special Harekat Directorate, and that Oktay was killed because it was discovered.
The death of Behçet Oktay, then Head of the Special Harekat Trusteeship, who was shot to death in Ankara on 25 February 2009, was described as "an assassination attempt".
But there were many question marks in the event.
Two years later, after a legal battle and the resulting evidence of the verdict of the Ailesi and family lawyers, a murder investigation was opened.
The gun that Oktay, a Solak, allegedly shot himself, was in his right hand.
Fractures in the ribs and darp marks were also detected in the body.
The Cinaytret investigation was opened in May 2012.
Only Halil Kesici, who was present at the time of his death and was licensed to fire a shotgun, was tried in Cinayet.

Behçet Oktay's sister, Şule Oktay, and brother Nezih Oktay, along with family lawyers, have been involved in numerous lawsuits.
Halitr Kesici's family, who said it was not possible for Halitr Kesici to kill special education teacher Oktay alone, demanded an expanded investigation.
The family, which said the case was covered up, demanded that the law enforcement officers who tried to close the case of Hüseyin Yalçın and Mustafa Düzgün and Behçet Oktay as suicide attempts be identified and tried.
After all the demands were handed over, it was revealed that six days before Oktay's death, he was nicknamed "Abdurrahman Doğru" by the Hezbollah Terror Organization.
It was determined that the person who had done this was the then Head of Emniyet Intelligence Branch Ramazan Akyürek.
Following this development, the Ankara Republican General Assembly, which re-elected Behçet Oktay's case, began to examine the signature of the cinematic film Fetullahçı Terör Örgütü'nün (FETÖ).
The case against Oktay's illegal stay in Ankara will begin on 19 September.

After the evening prayer, after watching the news on television and learning about the coup attempt, actress Fatma Can said:
We got together and went out together.
When we went to the bridge, there were people waiting there.
The bridge girder girmez, the tank fired on us twice.
We went upstairs, then continued walking with the tank.
There was a point on the bridge where a large bus stopped.
It was a very busy time.
We stayed there for a while, waiting.
We thought we could do something about it.
The Çtretin de Yan asked us to cross the line.
Since Yantride was a sharp shooter, I guess, we were an open target and got shot there.
Four hours after he had finished his prayer, he was martyred.
There was no such thing as Dartrbeden.
The wisdom of Allah is one of the...
Verentr Allah, alan Allah.
My wife had said before, "I'm going to put a tree in my grave that will bear fruit".
I made this wish come true by decorating the Erik Tree at the head of the table.
Fatma Can, who was grateful to President Erdoğan for visiting them, said, "May Allah bless her".

The sky will be the scene of meteor showers.
TÜBİTAK Ulustral Gözlemevi Araştırıcıısı and the Istanbul University Department of Astronomy and Uzay Bilimleri Teacher Üyesi Doç.Dr. Hasan Esenoğlu, AA correspondent, said in a statement that Perseid'in the night that closes Friday 12 August to Saturday 13 August will reach a high level.
Esenoğlu, who said that thousands of parts of the Perseid meteor shower were formed by the effects of sunlight and gravity from a comet called "Swift - tuttle", predicted that this would be transformed into a natural meteor shower.
Esenoğlu said that the Perseid meteorite was first discovered in 1862 and that since the 1990s it has been seen again around the world.
Noting that Perseid meteor shower could occur in July and August, Esenoğlu said, "We need to watch out for such a large amount of rain coming from Uzaydan, we need to take care of it".
After all, it is a natural beer made from cow's milk.
"The Hebrew will contribute to our better understanding of the world", he said.
Soğtrukken red, hotken white light will shine.
Esenoğlu, who predicted that some of the pieces that were smashed during the meteor shower would fall to the ground in the size of a quarter of an inch, continued:
Perseid temperatures can reach up to 2 bintr centigrade.
Due to the warming and friction in the atmosphere, Perseidler produces light in a natural environment of cold red and warm white colors.
You can contribute to the knowledge by writing how many meteorites have been seen on the International Meteorological Organization's websites.

Actress Esenoğlu noted that more than 100 meteor showers a year occur after the Perseid meteor shower, and that the Geminid meteor shower from December 4-17, was a natural event worth watching.
Aztr trained, former footballer Erdoğan
This bozo-trance, a victorious alliance between the populist Islamists led by the well-educated former footballer Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and the widely religious entrepreneur Fetullah Gülen in Taşkent, Texas, was a victorious alliance of thousands of highly educated followers of the newly established schools, universities and educational institutions.
The following is the conclusion of a sentence in an article published last week in Foreign Policy.
Erdoğan, a university graduate, is a less educated and former footballer; Gülen, a high school graduate, is widely regarded as a great entrepreneur, and Gülen's work is often cited in the Batı Basin as a source of publicity.
Then on the other hand, they try to make a statement in their articles on the topic "Why is Turkey's American and/or Western counter-revolution rising?" with sentences beginning with 'Because Erdoğan...'
It is possible to think that analysts who view the Batı controversy in Turkey as a neutral situation that emerged during the Erdogan era are oblivious to the Turkish history.
In fact, according to statistics, the first decade of Erdoğan's rule can be interpreted as a period in which the anti-Bati opposition in Turkey decreased or averaged.
Because within a year, the European Union and the United States had been developing good relations in sync with each other.
Erdogan's "one-minute" criticism of Israel, the EU's failure to formulate a policy on the escalation of civil war in Syria as a result of the massacres by the Assad regime in Syria, and the failure to leave Turkey alone in the refugee crisis, the outspoken behaviour of figures such as President Schulz of the European Parliament, the "Erdoğan is not our friend", the suppression of a curse competition by Britain and Erdogan, and the unimaginable behaviour of the then Mayor of London, the current Foreign Minister of Turkey, the unimaginable if the turmoil and the unrest of Turkey's civil war were to be overcome, the bombing of the PKK in Syria, the attack on all of our Syrian citizens, the PKK's terrorist groups and even the threats against Europe by the Turkish government, including the Turkish armed forces, the Turkish armed
Let us not forget that, as a result of the coup, we lost 247 people, that the so-called allies of the EU and the US have not given any support to democracy until the coup is proven to be a failure, that Kerry's first speech on the issue has been expected to build "peace and stability in Turkey", and that democracy and the elected government have not given any emphasis.
How can we forget that many leaders from all over the world, including Turkey, have taken part in a protest march in Paris over the killing of 11 Charlie Hebdo employees, or that no president of any Batılı country has visited Turkey since the coup attempt, even though a month has passed since the coup attempt that killed 247 tankers for democracy?
What about the high-level representatives of presidents or high-level representatives who come a few times a year to address the Mülteci issue?
How will we assess whether the ambassadors of the EU and the US have visited Turkey in the past because the Hürriyet newspaper has been broken and have not made a solidarity visit with the bombed Turkey Büyük Millet Meclisi?
In the first two weeks after the coup in Egypt, senior EU representatives and coup leader Sisi ile el sıkıştı remembered in Kerry's post-coup visit to praise the coup regime by saying 'democracy is being rebuilt', refusing to support Turkey's democracy, and saying that it was unusual for the countries to express their concerns about Turkey's democracy at their opportunity.
Even the fact that Gülen, whom 95% of the population see as responsible for the attack, is allowed to live freely in the United States is now leading to the persecution of the Turkish people.
If the above-mentioned background plan is added, I think it is clear that the rising West/American antagonism cannot be explained with Erdogan alone.
In addition, Erdoğan, who has not even said that he thinks he is a U.S. citizen, has already...
So the box was never a tefertrruat.
Do the Gezi Zekalans, who despised their own people, who said, "Sandık teferruattır", and who despised the unthinking electorate as "Karnını kaşıyan cahiller", still play the same telden after the night of July 15?
After seeing how this people has developed devlete and democratic society, do they ask themselves, "Where did we go wrong?"
Or how many questions do you have to answer?
So far, the soldiers who have served in various capacities and who have been given the right to bear arms by the state have accepted the status of "Hain" and sought asylum from foreign states.
We need to see how we live in a world of mental perversion and how people's attachments to people lead people to behave in a perverse way.
The brain-building entrepreneur Darbe has been successful...
Was there a perspective for those involved in this project beyond the city-states of Turkey to the cities of Syria?
Why did one morning the country's parliament bomb itself?
We could not resist the temptation to expect proper behavior from the fetus's beds and brain-wrecked brains.
Other responsible persons or persons responsible for her own affairs are not only FETÖ.
The political strife, also known as the kin ve hatred mesleği, has made a necessary contribution to the tragedies that have occurred.
The Aymazlar, who call themselves "Aydıntr", have convinced the public that her kind of unethical behavior and even disorderly behavior is natural.
We finally saw how those who hated their own people fired at the ring after they were given a string of guns.
The road to democracy, as we know it, is the road.
I say something very simple: On the evening of July 15th, FETÖ'cü snipers, haramiters, sergeants, and 250 martyrs died in Turkey's people's army and Kurds saved democracy.
There were three periods after July 15th: 1992-2002; 2002-2012; 2012 and beyond.
Three changes were made in these three periods: economic, social, and political.
Social change has produced two major changes: rural and metropolitan migration and the relocation of these migrants to the centre after living in the suburbs for a very long time.
On Wednesday I mentioned that this transportation was by metro.
I also emphasized the importance of the metro deyip geçmeyintr en important social change unsurudur diye.
The second major change in accuracy is bridges and roads.
The contribution of the road and bridge to modernisation is more easily understood.
The way things are going, the economic and social structure is changing.
Biztrde, on the other hand, has changed the political landscape a lot.
I have identified this history with the bridges over Boğaz in Istanbul for five years.
Demirel, the Boğaz Köprüsü'nü was made.
This was the culmination of the post-1950 farmer movement in the 1960s.
Ötrzal, in the same direction, continued the progress with the second bridge, which we now rename the 15 July Şehitler Bridge.
Their roads and paths show the relationship between the environment and the environment.
O is a sign of how a social change is taking place.
Demirel and Özaltr's goal was to have a large crowd in the center of Eritmekti.
The ideology of the bourgeoisie was not adopted by them.
For many years, the AK Party did not build a third bridge.
Because migration was moving at full speed.
Gelen people were deployed to satellite camps.
In other regions, a slightly closed beer system was created.
Local authorities of the AK Party have given people jobs, social status, and they are the AK Party.
So the masses were asked to acquire their political consciousness, not the erimesis at the center, but the political consciousness around them, and then come to the center as 'they themselves'.
This formation was related to the ongoing leadership disputes of the AK Party (1992-2002).
These discussions have led the masses to recognize the need for the people of Muhafazakar, Muteedeyyin and Tantra to stay together rather than to integrate themselves centrally.
The AK Party, after 2002, in a methodical move, has politicized the masses, politicized the country, and simplified it.
After all, now notice, the democratic struggle on July 15 with the construction of the bridge is timely.
Thus, history and sociology have been overlapping.
But a boyut is more clear: AK Parti'nin, bahsettiğim hamlesi is not limited to Istanbul's only railway.
What is even more interesting is that the AK Party is now integrating the surrounding towns with the central ones.
This is being delivered via this bridge.
Bir, the Osmangazi Bridge.
Two, the 1915 Çanakkale Bridge.
Lay out the right roads.
Turkey, Trakya'dan İzmir'e will now be reached by another route.
But you know, from now on, Izmir will be a different city.
The AK Party's 'içeriden' symbol, Izmir, will now be known as 'outsider'
Now Bursa, now Çanakkale, now Trakya cities will be transformed into other physical and social geographies.
That's what it is!
The martyrs of 15th of July are the stars of this great maceran.
Fenerbahçe'de Van Persie'li and his native city
Fenerbahçe continued the preparations for the Grasstrhoppers match with their morning training.
The training, which started at 10.00 hours under the direction of Cantr Bartu Tesisleri's technical director Vitor Pereira, lasted a total of 1 hour and 30 minutes.

Aziz Yıldırım'ı Gülen'e complained about the person...
There are new developments in connection with the Shike Operation in Fenerbahçe.
Journalist Hüseyin Gülerce, who took part in a program broadcast on CNN Türk'te and explained that the operation was carried out by FETÖ, "raised a name from the sports world Fethullah Gülen'e Aziz Yıldırım's words about himself".
"Yıldırım once said in a plane crash, 'What's the matter with this person, Senin Fethullah Gülen?'
This person Gülen'e passed on these words after Fethullah Gülen de Aziz Yıldırım'a tact.
Why did Aziz Yıldırım take the tactic?
The president of the club, which has Turkey's largest fan base, thinks that this mindset could be harmful to himself.
He used the phrase "Shike davası Aziz Yıldırım'ı to purify me".
This was followed by a statement from Faik Işık'tan, one of Şike Davası's prominent lawyers.
Işık Habertürk'te appeared on Karşıt Görüş and Aziz Yıldırım'ı FETÖ electorate Fethullah Gülen revealed the person who complained.
Here are the words of Faik Işıktrin:
Aziz Yıldırım, İhsan Kalkavan'a says something about Fethtrullah Gülen.
I'm from Azerbaijan, on a private plane.
Aziz Bey is a man who is a man who criticizes others and speaks with heartbreaking sentences.
The other catchphrase may be a bit of a catchphrase.
Some of these sentences may be reactionary.
This phrase is being raised by a woman.
Havlular, himmetler, such a large number of businessmen going to the mouth as if Hac'ca, Umre'ye had gone, is not such a tolerant business.
These are not business, they are very harshly critical.
Of course, that's not the problem.
By the way, a football team is in the middle of it.
Direct contacts with some of the players and managers from Galatasaray Kulübütr'den and Hakan Şükür...
Muhtrarrem Usta: The subject of Şike is different.
The president of Trabzonspor, Muharrem Usta, has extended the right hand to Fenerbahçe'ye dostluk.
Usta, who said that the Turkish issue, the whole clubs' issue, "is 79 million for this country".
Saptrasağlam bir duruş sergilemeliyiz is the first day of the week.
If Fenerbahçe's FETÖ is a little bit of a mess, injustice is done, then I'm going to be behind Fenerbahçe's Ben de Dururum.
"But the style between Trabzonstrpor and Fenerbahçe is different", he said.
The price of the sacrifice has been announced.
Karabulut, said: "Together we have fixed the price of a kilogram of live sacrificial food at 18 lire".
"We have determined the price of two trims and a live kilogram at 17 lira, the price of a live kilogram of the second-class bull we have labeled as 15 lira", he said.
Noting that animals that would not be sacrificed were also offered for sale last year, Karabulut pointed out what citizens should pay attention to when they receive sacrifices:
The ear canal should be carefully monitored, especially in animals.
It is also very important that the animal is healthy.
To do this, they can check the vaccines in the animal's passport while our citizens are taking the sacrifice.
Because of the appearance of the victim being alive and well, he must have wrapped his hair around him.
There should be no signs of a rash, such as a rash on the face of the salya.
In recent years, we have seen the sale of animals that have not been sacrificed and sold.
The animal for the sacrifice must be two years old.
This can be achieved by bacteria in the animal's teeth.
A two-year-old animal has developed teeth, which we call "kapak".
Animals of less than three years of age have not developed these teeth.
The animal may appear large or not have any fangs.
The captrak teeth are already noticeable here because they are larger than the others.

What a striking example of Robert Amsterdam and FETÖ!
Robert Amsterdam, a law firm executive at the international criminal investigation firm of Amsterdam&Partners, shared information on how the FETÖ is organized with Forbes, a US magazine.
Referring to the organization's management from FETÖ's head Fettrullah Gülen'in Pennsylvania, Amsterdam, Gülen said that "when one closely looks at how the approximately 150 charter instruments in the UAE operate, it will be plain that the organization has a hidden underground advanced organizational capability".
Amsterdam, citing that seven months ago Turkey had been tasked with investigating companies and schools linked to Gülen, stressed that their bulldogs were so far "shocked".
Amsterdam, in the meantime, has the following meetings:
According to the information given to us by the IFSC, Gülen has a strict hierarchy of instructions.
These instructions were generally passed at meetings between Gütren and Poconos face to face.
The Tepede seven kişidentr consisted of a management group (istişare group) var.
This group transmits the instructions to the consultative committee.
Talimatlar from here go to the regional imam, country imam, the regional imam within the country, il imam, the regional imam within the il, the imam of the mahalle, the imam of the student houses (shik evs) and the disciples.
Businessmen, bureaucrats and sub-trustees, work at varying levels according to their positions and their support within the organization.
The organization has 55 million jobs worldwide, has an extensive network of contract schools in the U.S. and is paid millions of dollars annually to these schools, according to the actor from Amsterdam.
Amsterdam, however, wrote that the bulk of these funds were directed to each other and transferred to "selected" companies.
Amsterdam, the tr tr explained this operation with the following examples:
Magnolia schools, a company affiliated with Gülen and sharing the same office, were seized in California for an annual service contract worth $700 billion.
Amsterdam, as another example, was shown by Dove Science Academy in Oklahoma.
Amsterdam, which said the school and the owner of the property paid an additional $3.1 million, also noted that the audit revealed that the school and the management of the property owner company were composed of the same persons connected to Gülen.
Noting that similar situations existed in the 46 branches of Harmony schools in Gütrlen, the largest in the network, FETÖ said it would pay smaller companies connected to it in parallel with such sticks as software licenses, code collection.
Highlighting the wealth of the mutual fund in the FETÖ in Amsterdam, he said, "This green sample shows that some $28 million of American taxpayers' money has been misused".
"So this is the visible part of our bulldogs so far", he used the phrase.
Noting that nothing has been done to prevent such incidents to date, Amsterdam recalled that the situation had deteriorated over time, and that the Texas Education Agency had begun investigating the irregularities.
Amsterdam, emphasized that schools seem to be functioning normally, and that many employees were unaware of any kind of corruption.
Amsterdam, "However, this opulence actually works like a car machine for Gülen".
"Gülen then uses the devasa miktardaki parala to political donations in order to cover up his illegal activities", he said.
According to the verdict of a former American teacher who worked in these schools, Amsterdam said that some of the employees at Gülen schools held separate meetings, organized a certain part of their pay, "It is believed that Gülen üyelerinin of the Turkish Armed Forces also worked in a similar capacity".
Over the years, Dartrbe instigators have strengthened their positions.
"But while the apparent clock was working normally, a parallel force was gathering power behind the scenes", he wrote.
Amsterdam, the coachman cried out:
U.S. policymakers have some questions about the events of July 15-16 and beyond, whether this is expected.
But while the two allies are taking their diplomatic status seriously, state officials individually need to be aware that U.S. law is being seriously violated in Gülen's operations.

Pay attention to this childish habit.
Dr. Bilgin Giray said that children, when they do not chew at an early age, are relieved by this reflex, turning their mother into a gereksine.
Dr. Giray, who listed the reasons for the apparent lack of parmak emme in children, said: "Parmak emme is a rare disease that occurs from birth to 3-4 years of age".
Most babies are prone to vomiting their thumbs.
In infancy we did not need to get a tattr to eat the parmaen child after 1-1.5 years of age anne memesi özlemini hermek and emmer her parmaen to relax.
"You can get tired and relax, when sleeping is over, when you're nervous and when you're away from home, and when you're not able to behave", she said.
Stressing that the partreme's behavior in the early years was based on the inability of the mother-child relationship and the knowledge that the child's sense of confidence was not sufficiently developed, Dr. Bilgin Giray described the dental health and its consequences in these words:
Partrak's behavior does not have a negative effect on the shape of a child's teeth.
The bassinceral sonucunda that arises in the Emme esnas is the uptake dişler anterior to the itlirken, the altaki dişler de geriye itlir.
This leads to the positioning of the alt-chenenin gertride, which causes the dengesification of the damak and tooth joint.
The physiological reflection of this is in the form of speech disorder and the aesthetically unfavorable appearance of the conclusion.
Dr. Giray noted that if no effective solution is found, a much more complex treatment process can be experienced in the 6-7-year period when permanent teeth begin to develop. "We can protect our children from clogging and clementia problems without completing their development".
"That is why children today need to keep their mouths under control, like eye and hearing controllers", he concluded.
The newest addition to the lineup is the Trifokal Lensler.
Patients who have had cataracts naturally do not want to wear glasses.
Multicentered treatments have already been used for many years to solve this problem in our patients.
The trifocal drugs that have been introduced in recent times have taken the success of the treatment a step further.
The difference between Trifugal Lenses and other components is not only the distance between them, but also the distance between them, defined as the distance between them.
Utrzak, near the town of Ara mesafe görme bozuklukları is a medical center.
The distance between the two points in the geometrical bozukluk of the gorge represents a point that we often use in our daily life.
For example, the dashboards of cars, all the laptops in our kitchen, or the distance between tables that we define as 60-70 cm of wheelbase.
Thanks to the corrective distance between the trifocal lenses, our patients, whether near or far, will not need glasses at all.
Another advantage of Trifokal merchandise is that it reduces nighttime complaints.
Dr. Volkan Hürmeriç "There is no difference between trifocal lens therapy for her mesafe vision treatment and normal cataract treatment".
Our patients who have been given trifocal therapy can easily recover their eyes from a 7 to 10 minute procedure.
And the next day, our patients can return to their normal lives.
This is an operation that improves the quality of life, especially for people who drive, are over-computed, and live more active lives.
You can also consult an eye specialist to find out if this procedure is suitable for you and can be applied to any patient who is over the age of 18.
Varistrli is not used in cardiac surgery!
Varis, the frequency of the disease has been increasing in recent years.
The variste, whose genetic closeness is a priority factor; long hours of work, long hours of work, and long hours of sleeping lead to an increase in complaints of long hours of sleep.
Is Dtramarlar used in heart surgery?
Sorulairs such as Varisim var, iltrerde crise cardiaque geçirirsem ne yapılır? are often wondered about by people.
Here are the answers to these questions.
Bacakta has two types of top-sea systems:
1.The deep venous system, which carries the blood from the lower leg to the lungs and connects the main venous system of the leg, is called the anaerobic system.
These are called the deep femoral vein and the superficial femoral vein.
These problems in the upper blood are more rare, the potential for disease cannot be closed, and drug therapy is used to open up these potential.
There is a superficial carotid system, which carries the coronary arteries to the lungs and is connected to the deepest coronary system.
This system consists of two large and two small safen ventrums, which we call toplardamares.
Four of these possibilities can be used to create a unique and varied life.
The toplardamarlar, which is used in calcium operations, are large safen veins of denilen surface toplardamarlar.
The absence of these veins does not cause any harm to the body and can therefore be used in cardiac surgery.
However, for these vessels to be used in cardiac surgery, they must be healthy.
Because the heart is a very important organ.
The process of surgically removing or laser-setting varicose veins and burning them, reduces the workload of deep veins and makes the leg healthier.
A common misconception among the Halk is that the varisli can be used as a backup.
Varistrli's ability to perform heart surgery is never and never used!
There are other vessels that can be used in calcium operations.
There are backup vascular systems that can be used in surgery of the knee; the chest is located underneath the cafeteria, around the midenin and colda.
So there is no reason to wait and worry about using the varicose veins for the heart.

As a layman, it was a very lively encounter.
As we all know, our country was hit by a huge tsunami on the night of July 15.
The coup attempt of the Fettrullahçı Terör Örgütü/Parallel State Yaptılanması (FETÖ/PDY) against our democracy was overcome by the unity and unity of all sections of society.
Otr night as millet heavy bedeller junior.
The court ruled against Şehtritler.
A large number of gazimiz var.
This painful price once again reminded us of the virtues of democracy, the necessity and importance of peace, not conflict, in these lands.
One night representatives of the Turkmen side of the tek ses, tek yürek protested against the coup; together they stood for democracy.
In these critical times, we need the characteristic of a sporun birtrellicici than ever before.
I wish that this match, just before the start of the new football season named after our legendary club captain Turgay Şeren's name, will be the start of the Turkish sporting environment of love and peace.
I hope that the victory will be national and Turkish sports, regardless of the score at the end of the match, in front of the half-paid crowd of Galatasaray and Beşiktrtaş fans.

Britain is a gold star in the Scotch Callum Skinner eve uçuyor.
While the British Team Triple Crown 2012 Londoners were taking the title, Scottish Callum Skinner, who won the men's race at the Rio race, won last night.
Glasgow, 23-year-old racer, Scottish Sör Chris Hoy'un took on the pioneering role and this young, self-made New Zealand giysis and event victory rocker boasted this legend.
In the event four years earlier, when today's six Olympic gold medals were five, Britain had been shocked by a victory.
Although Ve Hoy'un retired, they did so again, finishing sixth at the World Rowing Championships in London in March.
The problem between Beijing and London, the expert starting point, was the replacement of the play Jamie Staff.
This is exactly what the Indians did when they first appeared.
Today's e-mail created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
The Scot saw the potential he had now realized and did not give up on British coach Skinner.
Four years ago, the Indies, Kenny and Skinner, who won the tournament with Hoy, broke the Olympic record in the qualifying tournament, but New Zealand's first ever tournament set the record again.
And the British trio, the Duelloy for gold, came out.
Hindtres, if his own turunda had been a little bit of a mess, Kenny would have brought the team in and Skinner would have been a little bit of a mess.
Much of the transformation that led to Kenny and especially Skinner's pace-tracking, using a larger tool to slow down the Hinds, was a change in strategy.
Today, the BBC expert commentator followed them from the ground and as they got off the podium, he caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes.
"This is an honourable comparison", said Skinner, 23, of Glasgow.
I'm just here to do what I can and to preach.
In the final, we broke the Olympic record and beat the world champions.
Butr was truly amazing.
There can be no better way to earn it.
Hindes, London 2012'de Kenny and Hoy admitted to falling behind the track after a poor start after winning the 2012'de Kenny and Hoy.
Later, this decision was overturned and there was no method of menstruation to match British competitors.
This time, there was no such problem for an incredible winner.
Hindes said: "With all the flags of Great Britain standing up, we felt like we were flying in London".
We have a team that was founded just three months ago.
We've lost so many worlds, so it's an amazing feeling to win back at the Olympics.
This is a one-off event, a medal for a nation that has won six of the 10 races in Beijing and London.
If we have made progress in this five-day race, he will have five more days to live to successfully race on the track.
Kenny's beneficial tutum shows that today's single Olympic gold medal record of three golds is not impossible.
This means that Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and who was born on 23 March (which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister, will win six gold medals and one silver medal).
Bu da Hoy ile ile ile ile on the same level.
Kenny, from now on, you will be taking part in a sprint race; the race will start today and will last for three days.
Boltontrlu, 28, said: "I'm just enjoying it right now.
Team events are always in the works.
You can go to the casino with your friends.
To be honest, when you win alone, you feel alone.
Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted".
Although this is only the occasion of today's medal event, there is much good news for Britain.
Sörtr Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull finished first in the four-man, four-kilometer team event.
Pistons finished with a time of 3:51.943.
London 2012's gold medal winner set a world record of 3:51.659.
The first round and final (22:42) will be decided in today's second half and will definitely draw Wiggins' attention to himself.
Yesterday, before the ranking round, when he was called by the authorities to measure his stature, he had a falling out with officials.
In the women's event that will continue and finish tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavie'den Katie Archibald set a world record with a time of 4:13.260.
The Great Britain team relies on a strong cycling team to score discs in the middle of the Olympics and win many medals.
After major overtaking in Beijing and London, the number of customers in Rio'da has decreased significantly.
Due to accusations of sexism and bullying by Shane Sutton, the technical director of the Ark Planda, many bad developments have taken place, including his resignation on Nisan and the retirement of such prominent names as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But the first night after the track races shows that Britain's reputation for excellent speed can be proven again this time.
The future of the energy contract between the IPTR and the Portland coal-fired power plant is questionable.
The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria, the work of hundreds of workers, and the energy company that supplies power to the plant, has been left uncertain after one of the plant's owners unveiled a fashion supply contract that will open the pipeline of all supply contracts.
This move came after the Victorian government's decision earlier this year not to override subsidies for the continued operation of the plant.
The 20-year fixed subsidy period is Kasım'da doluyor.
Altrcoa's Portland plant may be at risk by 2000.
Any one transaction could put up to 2,000 jobs at risk, directly or indirectly.
The coal industry is also resilient, as it consumes about 10 percent of all Victoria's electricity.
In 2014, Alcoa Point Henry shut down its oil and gas pipeline, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Altrcoa's Portland-based thesis is facing a loss and a risk of liquidation.
These developments came after several years of speculation about the future of the plant, initially with the strengthening of the Australian dollar and recently with the rise of the fuel consumption per day.
AGL, which supplies power from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, in the large aluminium-fired oil field, said it expects the other three contracting parties to move towards a trend.
The vast majority of the plant is a joint venture between Altrcoa and Alumina, with smaller stakes held by CITIC in China, Japan and Marubeni Corp.
"AGL expects the Portland test to continue; this means that the physical electrical cable of the furnace will continue", he said.
AGL, the contractor, stated that there were "risk dengeleme contracts" that were to come into force from November 2016.
The contracts are for a period of 12 months and will be completed in 2017.
Enertrenergy said, "Therefore, AGL will continue to expect the contractors to contribute to the 2017 fiscal year".
With the current impact that AGL could have on potential gains in 2018 and beyond, the company is limited to the adoption of a strong bonding agreement for the top electricity prices.
AGL, due to "feshintr expectations", said the value of its contracts in its accounts had already fallen to $187 million.
Alcoa said the decision to sign the contract "affected Alcoa's ability to operate crude oil or electricity supplies to crude oil".
The US-based company signed a 20-year contract in 2010; it was due to come into force in November this year, but has not yet explained why it has not withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts are wary of the possibility of closure due to economic difficulties in the sector of the Portland oil refinery in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
Earlier this week, Stephen Mikkels, AGL's chief operating officer, who analyzed the response, said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy a year, while Tomago uses 900 megawatts.
If both of these theses are withdrawn from the market, the [electric] market will cause the telephone to drop significantly.
And as producers, this would not be a good development for us".
Not only is Kardashian the star of the TV show; Kendall, on the cover of Vogue's Eylültr.
Model and executive Anne Kristrin, fourth daughter of Kardashian-Jenner group Kendall Jenner (20), is on the cover of the highly anticipated Eylül Mr. of US Vogue.
Kendall, who is a brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and has been a model at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Instagram on Thursday.
Kendall wrote, "I cried as I looked at this cover of a room full of people".
Following the cover announcement, a reality video was released featuring the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (possibly with Rob and Caitlyn and their favorite show-world uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) and a script-based reality video; the family had forgotten the heads of their sisters and later made a classic soundtrack: they were actually preparing a surprise party.
Although this is a cliché of her "birthday" episode of almost all children's television programs (a comic strip on Seacrest Morning 8's "You forgot me?" is a joke) Kris, the other girls, must have included it in some way.
With this development in Vogue'un Eylültr, we are definitely entering a new era of Kardashians.
Kendall's ablastic Kim may have outdone her in appearing on the cover of Vogue (she shared the cover with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's Eylül cover was a success on its own.
Vogue's Eyltrül issue became the most satanic issue of the year.
The size of a fashion magazine's coffee table book and the number of ads it contains caught the attention of many advertisers (Fashionista, last year, found that there was advertising content in 615 832-page cildins).
The disclosure of the Kaptrak star is a process closely followed; for the past two years, the magazine's images have been leaked before official announcements.
Women who had previously held carpet jobs include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has been given a place for "modeling celebrities" from the "true models".
Oscar-winning Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, and the following year, Lady Gaga was honored with the honor.
However, in the case of Ms Jenner's previous category, which was described by dergi as a "talking model" of neslintrin, it can be said that the environment is quite good.
These aren't celebrities, celebrities' relatives, reality show stars or the teenagers of today who shoot good Snapchat videos (though Jenner is all of them).
All of these are women with legitimate talents, who are prominent in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who was featured on the cover of Lemonade last year, had one of the best moments of her career with her appearance.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Due to the reality show's history, Jenner's fame in the fashion world will always be uncomfortable.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour, Jenner and colleague Gigi Hadid were criticized by the media and dubbed "the junkies of the times".
When news broke that Jenner would be on the cover of Vogue, this thought came up again.
But the focus on the memnuniyetsizlki seems to be empty.
Kendall Jenner, on the cover of Vogue's September issue.

Toptrumsal Legal Support Centers annually deport 160,000 people.
The sector, which is currently preparing to create more funding opportunities for forced operations, is being displaced from its social justice support centres by over 160,000 undocumented immigrants.
Three out of five people in Queensland (mostly elderly people, immigrants, undocumented workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair dismissals, etc.) are being denied free legal advice and representation.
Social legal support services, which have exhausted their resources, are preparing more cases.
Beginning in June of next year, these legal support centers are expected to be deprived of more than 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrel, Queensland Director of Toplumsal Hukuk Destek Centres, said in his Sayım Report from the National Association of Toplumsal Hukuk Destek Centres that thousands of people are diagnosed with recycling every year.
Baytr Farrel, the federal government's decision not to reverse the situation, said the situation would get much worse.
"The social justice support centres in Queensland are chronically receiving insufficient financial support, which means they are not getting the vital services that thousands of people need", said Kendisi.
People in violent relationships, struggling with the government and the powers that be, families in the process of separation and workers unfairly displaced... all face problems of legal size and are not getting the help they need, according to this report.
The federal government, starting in June 2017, has allocated 30 percent of its funding to the state, which means that thousands of Queensland residents in the most corrupt state will be forced to deal with more complex legal problems without assistance.
To provide the support people need when faced with a legal problem, we urge Justice Minister and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately withdraw these financial cuts.
Last year, the government fulfilled its promise to cut legal aid funding to a low-income level.
We must now look to the social justice support centres and their communities and the Palaszczuk government for the investment in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued after he claimed to have taken a gun from a person.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign foul, the North Carolina operations director, was sued for failure to act after a staff member was allegedly checked a chip and a gun in February.
Vaka, on Wednesday, a lawsuit was filed in state court by former software trainer Vincent Bordini, a member of the state campaign team.
Bordrini said he waited months for him to take care of the situation internally, but later realized that "there will be no more blame".
As Bordini's complaint notes, the Director, Earl Philip, "drew a gun, put his right index finger on the thumb and pointed it towards the nose of Vincent".
According to the complaint, Bordtrini learned that at least four other people had the same experience as Phillip after complaining to the leaders of the local and regional campaign team.
Bordtrini's complaint said "weapons do not need to be fired to cause harm".
Dava, the Republican presidential candidate, opened two days later after the fury caused by the North Carolina riot, saying that "three amendment people" (apparently gun owners and gun backers) could be overthrown if his opponent Hillary Clinton were elected and elected their own judges.
He said Trump's campaign was bad, that the media took these words out of context and that he did not support the current situation.
Bordini, complaint letter, and supervisory reporting claimed compensation from Phillip for the damage to the campaign team and the attack, darp and maneuver.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said the message requesting comment did not quickly turn around.
Attempts to reach Phillip failed.
WCCB, a local news agency based in Charlotte, said Phillip had recently left the campaign.
A call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, was not promptly returned.
Republican President Donald Trump is campaigning for the Republican Party.
Bordini, Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300 case, General Adalet Mahkemesi, Yüksek Mahkeme Şubesi, Mecklenburg Kaza (Charlotte) was also found guilty.

The dispute over the removal of the funds has been resolved.
A seamless sedasless bag was introduced on the Turkey Varlık Fonu itirazlar, which is expected to penetrate the world's largest waves.
Due to the lack of a verification mechanism for the fund, it was decided to meet again, but without any changes, the committee met again.
The Turkish Workers' Fund, which is being introduced by the AKP, is being evaluated by the CHP Milletvekili and Plan and the Bütçe Commissioner Utku Çakırözer, who said: "We are absolutely opposed to the fact that the compulsory retirement funds from the workers, workers, and unemployed persons will be held outside the Anayasal denetim mechanisms".
The Turkish Varlık Fonu bill, which the government has prepared to provide long-term funding for investors and projects, was also rejected on Tuesday at a meeting where the muhalefetin were expected to be discussed separately.
However, AKP today brought the proposal back to the same situation as the Plan and the Bütçe Commission.
The TBMM Plan and the Büttrçe Commission of the CHP'li member Eskişehir Milletvekili Utku Çakırözer, Varlık Fonu, expressed the concerns and concerns of the CHP regarding the proposed legislation sozcu.com.tr'ye.
Çakırözer, "When the Bu fonun kurulması Plan and the Bütçe Commission came to the bill, former Maliye Minister Zekeriya Temizel, who was the head of the CHP, expressed concern and suggested that the bill be deleted and discussed in detail".
The government, which accepted our view, withdrew the bill.
The same way yesterday the commission came again.
"The government seems to be insisting that it be removed from the legislature within a week", he said.
Noting that there must be a consensus on the way the Varlık Fund legislation is passed, Çakırözer said, "Our biggest concern in this bill is the lack of jurisdiction".
"The assets of the employee, the workers, the pension benefits to be taken from the employees, the income to be collected from the unemployment fund for the unemployed, the income to be obtained from privatisation, are transferred without any liability to a structure outside the control of the Mejlis and Sayıştay", he said.
Such funds were set up by Russia, China and the Gulf countries with oil revenues and trade surpluses, and the fund was thus financed, Çakırözer said, "But we still have a savings gap".
So the fund will be made up of public resources, i.e. the people's money.
A total of 100 billion trillion in the unemployment fund, 100 billion of the individual retirement funds forced on employees, 50 billion without privatization is planned to be transferred.
"So this fund, which will be completely publicly owned, needs to be publicly monitored and not be held accountable", he said.
Stressing that the collection of government funds, the depreciation of government assets in debt, and the unacceptable detention of a fund outside the legislature of the state, Çakırözer expressed his concern and concern about the proposed law of the Varlık Fund:
The collection, trading, and lending of such a large amount of assets in the name of a commune cannot be carried out solely by independent denetime companies.
The key is to have a clear and transparent structure.
In the law of the land, Varlık Fonu'nun Anayasal has no rules on the tenetimi and transparency of many curricula.
There is no limit to how many resources can be transferred.
No one will ever be able to account for the use of this phone.
The purpose of the fund is to provide funding for large projects.
For this, there is no need to set up a phone without a denet without a budget.
Why don't you put the budget into it?
Such a situation naturally leads to the question, "Why are SAyıştaş and Meclis being evaded from scrutiny?'
Noting that the Varlık Fund does not oppose the transfer of brick money into investments, or that it is done through opaque, uncalculated mechanisms, Chakırözer continued: "Whether such a fund is needed can be debated".
But if the Government insists on this, then we must ensure that the international standards in force in Turkey apply to other countries where such investment funds are established.
The system of accountability and accountability must be structured in such a way as to ensure that it is fully functional.
Since there will be no shayebers, the vatandaša must set up the account of his own money used in such a way that he can keep his account until the sun.
Stressing their strong opposition to the bill, Mr. Çakırözer said, "The AKP is particularly pleased to hear our critics in the Meclis after the July 15 attempt".
We hope that this bill will be passed by the AKP's powerful electorate.
We oppose the illegal use, dispossession, irresponsibility of those who use it and the lack of dictionary audits.
"Only if these concerns are addressed can they be useful", he said.
It was learned that work was being done to reconcile the AKP and the muhalefet on the Gelen law proposal.

If we are united and united, our problems will be solved on their own.
We were able to bring the Ottoman Turks to this land 160 years ago.
We will continue to be present in Turkey in these areas.
"We're going to build Elbette factories or else our horizons should be open in this area", he said.
Shell Turkey Ültrke Chairman Ahmet Erdem, who identified Turkey as a top 10 priority for them, said, "Turkey is a top 10 priority for Shell".

Confident work is being done for international investors.

Because the CEO's income was very important.
They were found in bulletproof carts, corumns, and other demands.
Then she came here and saw that everything was normal.
He left the police and the car and returned home happy.
One country's investment is like evilism.

Başbakan Yıldırım continued: "We will quickly move on from the aftermath of this and look ahead".
Our constant life with constant struggles is never right.
We have very ambitious goals ahead of us.
This coup attempt did not hamper Turkey's economy.
Those who awaited chaos and crisis were once again mistaken.
Today our democracy and our economy are in full swing.
Our banking and finance sectors continue to function in a healthy manner.
The external trade deficit appears to have fallen by 25 percent in 2015.
The national interest rate in 2014 was 5.8 percent, down from 4.5 percent in 2015.
We aim to cut 4'tr by the end of this year.
We will never change the rigid surroundings in Kamu's mind.
Turkey's 2016 budget of 130 countries has been implemented in excess of a million dollars.
We have reduced the national income ratio of the budget deficit to 1.3 percent in 2015, which was above 11 percent, and we are continuing to maintain these rates.
Kamu borcunda AB'dentr, we are better off than many countries in the world.

Turkey is not giving up on the European Union, but is not giving up on the European Union.

BAŞBAKAN Deputy Minister Mehmet Şimşek, Minister of Science and Technology Faruk Özlü, Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekci İstanbul Sanayi Odası (İSO) attended the summit "Turkiye'ye güvenenler, Türkiye'de üretenler" organized by the Turkish government.
Speaking at the meeting, Bilimtr Sanayi and Minister of Technology Faruk Özlü said, "I think that many positive results have been obtained from the developments that took place during and after July 15".
The most important of these is undoubtedly the spirit of unity and unity that all Turkey feels deeply at the moment.
The July 15th process showed how dynamically the Turkish economy is moving and how socially and democratically integrated it is.
"For a society that has achieved this level of economy and democracy, it is clear that the next process will go better, easier and faster", he said.
"TURKEY'S life is a secondary death sentence"
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci, who said he was struggling to tell the world about his initiative on July 15 when Faruk Özlü'trüden took office, said that as a government, he had declared a mobilization on the issue.
Zeybekci said of the interest rate rates introduced by recent banks, "If 63.4% of the profits of the top five percent of the Benim reel sector are going to the rate, we must focus on this business and give up all our energy".
So our President is already going back and forth on this.
With the reel sector, the banking system, the government, the politics, the unity of politics after the Turkish civil democracy revolution of 15 July, Turkey must emerge from this crisis.
We welcome the recent developments in this regard.
"I hope that we will achieve the sustainability and continuity of the next generation of banks, not only as a competitive economic regime but also as a bottom-up, zero-percent wage point like nine, eight per cent, which our president initiated at his instigation", he said.
"YESIL PASSAPORTU, IHRACATCHIMIZIN EMRİNE VERECEĞIZ" was also written.
"We will be the world's next big cat", said Nihat Zeybekci, "under the leadership of our President, our Prime Minister, we will not leave a country untouched in the world, we will not leave a door unlocked".
We will not leave our business without any auction-related topics.
"We will never and never ignore this; we will not be like the old bird chasing after the bird of the road".

"The DARBE GIRİŞİMİDE BURUNANLARIN has developed a tendency to build up"
Speaking about the coup attempt and the OHAL announced after it on 15 July, Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek said, "The coup attempt is a 'bus' and we must go ahead".
He said that the OHTR was declared for two simple reasons: "Of course, those involved in this coup attempt must be cleared of the state, and this process is working; or more importantly, serious administrative reforms were needed to prevent such coup attempts".
As a necessary climate for administrative reform, the Olağanüstü Hal was declared and so far very serious structural reforms have been carried out.
"We will continue to do all this, whether we have acted in a democratic and legal state or not", he said.
Noting that life is back to normal in many areas, Şimşek stressed that there is no reason for concern among companies and individuals who are not involved in terrorist financing.
Speaking of Turkey's democratic consolidation, Şimşek said, "The foundations of Turkey's democracy have solidified; because when you look at the root of recent problems, you will see that this betrayal network is involved.
"So the state clearing of this terrorist organization, the closure of this period in Turkey, will strengthen Turkey's democracy", he said.
Noting that the fundamentals of the economy are generally sound and that the economy is never losing ground, Shimshek said that "Turkey has returned to its original agenda, and there is progress in structural reforms".
We cannot afford to do reforms; because in the world populism, conservatism, is on the rise.
"Only through reform can Turkey prepare for the future", he said.
Finally, stressing that Turkey will not break from Batı, Şimşek said that "Turkey may be at odds with our allies, our friends, or Turkey will not break from Batı, nor will it break from the European Union".

Britain should channel the Olympic route and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will be a place of new growth and prosperity not only in our local communities and London, but across the country.
I think that the incredible effort we have made to make sure that all countries and regions benefit from the Games will make Heathrow quite attractive, as London did in 2012.
The Olympics provided great advantages for Stratford and the East End.
We will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
We will create 10,000 new internships for our local communities alone, 40,000 new jobs, and we will not leave youth unemployed in the Hawaiian area.
As in London before 2012, Heathrow's expansion struggle will be considered too difficult.
They were telling me that Britain would never prepare for the Games and that we would be a reproach to the world.
Kuşku was wrong in 2012 and will be wrong about Heathrow.
There will always be an angel to deal with, but Heathrow, the airport, answers all your questions.
As with the Olympics, Heathrow has a single infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion, 180,000 new jobs and £211 billion in economic growth opportunities are leaving many skills and job opportunities at the airport and across the UK.
From Heathrow to T5 (the airport was voted the world's best airport terminal for five years running) to T2, we have a fantastic team that is ready to implement a real estate investment of £11 billion, timely and budget-appropriate for the world's busiest two-lane intersection.
Now, we are ready to launch a third runway, backed by private investment worth £16bn.
The London 2012 Games were a huge success for the United Kingdom and the Heathrow expansion will no doubt be the same.
It is time to channel the expansion of the Olympic-style Heathrow through a business that will ensure our future and create many new skills and jobs that Britain will be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton, Heathrow's chairman of the board and former Secretary of Commerce at the Treasury Department
Adtrblock Plus, Facebook's ad campaign, is "like a candy-fare game" when it comes to advertising.
One of the companies that makes advertising software for online advertising to win companies says it's a "kid-fare game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ads on its desktop sites, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying that its users could update their filters to block social media ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the code surrounding the ads to make it easier for advertisers to identify which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock says it's now unlocking the new codes.
In a blog post, Adtrblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this ongoing back-and-forth struggle between the publicity community that blocks open source advertising and those who try to prevent it has been going on since the invention of adblocking" and that Facebook could soon come up with its own solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company is taking up this challenge shows how much interest advertising has generated for the industry.
According to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, nearly 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers; that's four times the number of people who used such software in 2013.
Facebook's mobile devices are used by 1.03 billion daily active users and mobile advertisers now account for 84 percent of Facebook's ad revenue.
A spokesperson said that mobile advertising engelleyiciler social networking site Facebook's mobile apps and Instagram were not effective, so the company has been chasing down the advertising engelleyiciler in the area.
Since Facebook considers such a campaign worth investing in, holding desktop ads should be able to generate enough revenue.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it will update its "third party advertising" tool so that people can better control the ads they are advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook, Adblock's new filtering system, claimed to be annoying, and the site would block some of the non-advertising content.
A Facebook spokesperson said in an email interview: "We plan to address this issue by providing a good experience for these people".
Advertising is a tired tool, so we are focused on creating tools like Advertising Third to give people control.
A woman ran into the Swiss car and entered; the incident appeared to be suicide.
The victim was lying on the highway at midnight.
Police, in what appeared to be a suicide, are looking for people who witnessed a woman hit by several cars on the highway early Thursday.
Olay, just after midnight on Thursday, the A1'de near Morges in the canton of Vaudtr happened.
Vaud police said in a statement that the woman had fallen to the ground "unharmed" in the dark and had been hit by several vehicles.
He hit several vehicles, including a truck, on a 49-year-old Swedish woman who was clearly on the lookout for her life.
Kendricks died on the spot.
Police said they had met with the driver's helmsman, but some of them were not identified and asked them and all the other drivers to contact them.
Lawyer Gilles Hofsttretter, Le Tribune de Geneve, said in a statement that "a criminal prosecution has been opened as a'reasonable' step to be taken in situations like Bunun".
However, it is not yet known whether the drivers involved will face any charges.
Is it possible to avoid a crash?
That's what the savvy needs to be detected", Hoftretter said.
Two similar cases in the past five years have shown that drivers will not be held liable.
In the newspaper her du vaktrada da (both of which included a person walking out of a dark highway), the driver was sentenced to a sentence that it was normal for drivers to push one side across the highway at midnight.
Last year, in August 2014, a police officer was found not guilty of causing death by dangerous driving after he hit a man on the road near the A1'de Paynerne.
Mahtrkemede, the 22-year-old victim was reported to be drunk and leaking on the way.
The court found that the police officer responding to a call for an emergency had used the vehicle reasonably and that the presence of a man on the road was "absolutely unusual and unforeseeable".
Those with information about the incident near Morges on Thursday are on the police line from 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once adapted for life.
According to new NASA climate model predictions, Venus once had habitable conditions.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Uzay Institute have developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, its warm, waterless surface and CO2-filled atmosphere once lived in similar conditions to Earth.
Scientists have used the cold atmosphere to explain Venus' low rotation speed in the past.
But a new predictor suggests that Venus may have had an atmosphere similar to Earth's, and yet could rotate slowly.
The model also includes the old Venus's topography of baktı.
If there were more mountainous regions on Earth than there are on Earth, it may have once had enough water and geographic variability to withstand rapidly rising volcanoes.
The ancient Venus, at the same time, was also benefiting from a 30 percent orange-lower sun.
"The slow rotation of Venus in the simulations of the GISS model made it possible for the daytime side of Venus to rotate around the sun for almost two months at a time", said GISS scientist Anthony Deltr Genio in a newsletter.
This surface heat caused rainfall to form thick clouds that moved like an umbrella to protect against the sun-induced heat.
As a result, average climate temperatures were only a few degrees colder than the Earth's current temperature.
The model has resulted in a similar story to evrime, which scientists who had previously drawn for Venus had proposed as a hypothesis.
Although Venus once had habitable conditions, it has been subjected to extreme heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
The oceans were blown up and the storm's ultraviolet light was destroyed by the Yanarak.
With the depletion of hydrogen and the decay of the atmosphere, only a deadly greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, and oxygen-rich atmosphere remained; that is, Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate model in their Geophysical Research Articles.
Patrick Roy, the Avalanche antentrörörn, has resigned from his position.
Patrick Roy, who said the team was not given the key in the decision-making process, resigned from his position as assistant to the president of Colorado Avalanche coaching and hockey operations on Thursday.
Colorado's vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the development and immediately announced that the club would begin a new coaching staff.
"Over the past three years, I have served as the assistant to the president of head coaching and hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination", said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
Throughout the summer, seeing the depth needed by this team, I thought long and hard about how I could improve and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of coach and VP hockey operations needs to be in perfect harmony with the vision of the organization.
He also needs to have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
In the case of Mevtrcut, these conditions have not yet been met.
On 23 May 2013, Roy'tr team captain Sakic thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick today informed me of his decision", Saktric said.
We thank him for all he has done for our organization and wish him all the best in his future.
Roy, Avalanche letr 2013-14 saw Jack Adams as the league's first head coach.
The club scored 112 points and helped the team finish first in the league, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and missed the postseason in both years.
The Avalanche went 39-39-4 in 2015-16 and scored five points short of the second-place mark in the Western Conference.
Roy, a Hall of Fame catcher, two Montreal Canadiens, and two Avalanche, won four Stanley Cups.
The strike of the oil workers of the Denizi of the North went on for three days and the talks continued.
The strike was called off due to the salaries of the North Denizi oil workers, and the negotiators began to negotiate a new price.
The strike against the oilfield services company Wood Group is being staged gradually on platforms in Northern Denizi operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
The statement read: "As Wood Group and Unite and RMT unions, we have decided to restart the process to resolve the existing dispute".
Over the next few weeks, starting next week, we will be holding a series of all-day meetings to take a new view of issues.
The trade unions said that this was the first protest against pay cuts that could reach 30 percent in 25 years.
Wood Group, this year, cut about 9 percent of payments to North Denisians due to negative pressures in the past.
Following this fee reduction process, the company applied a 10 percent price reduction to its shore cargoes in 2014.
The company said it would provide the space it needed to get through the tough times in the past.
Shell, in the process of merging with British energy company BtrG Group, has laid off thousands of people, training their operations and announcing plans to stop up to 10 oil and gas operations in the country.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low ham oil prices, an economic situation caused by Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Earlier this week, Scottish MP Dave Anderson will meet with Labour leaders to discuss one of the largest labour disputes in the Northern Denies.
As he himself has said, the Northern Denizi is vital to the regional economy.
"We need a majority-efficient economy, not for the minority, but for the majority", said Kendisi in a statement.
Despite an average investment of about $7 billion over the past five years, in 2016 it is expected that less than $1.4 billion will be invested in new projects in the Northern Denizi.
Kepler measured the rotational speed of the stars in the star Ülker tr.
The Kepler space telescope, the sontr mission and the Milky Way helped astronomers to create an exaggerated catalogue of stars in the Milky Way star Ülker in terms of their rotational speeds.
New verilers help astronomers understand why stars in their constellations rotate at varying speeds and why rotation periods are associated with the formation of planets.
Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Red Planet Research and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a newsletter: "When we compare our sounds to the stars, we look forward to learning more about the relationship between the mass, age, and even the past of the solar system".
Ülker's team star is 445 light-years from Earth.
Most of the stars in the constellation were formed 125 million years ago and are reaching a new level of maturity.
They can travel at high speeds throughout their lives.
At peak rotational speeds, stars in this phase of collapse form a large amount of stellar wind.
These winds have a fracturing effect on the stars as they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to decrease.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracing the process between the appearance of the visible star, such as the sun's rays.
In the latest rotational speeds catalogue, the larger stars are predicted to rotate faster than the smaller stars.
Rebtrull, who likened his stars to dancers, said that the big ones performed their turn on their feet more slowly than the small ones.
Rebull said, "We see that the 'balk' that rotates slowly is much heavier, and the fast ones are very light".
Ültrker serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing the star's characteristics and rotational speeds, as the team star is very close.
Rebull said "Ulker provides theoretical models for the two-way rotations of the star as a young and old star".
We wanted to know more about how, when and why stars rotate, and why they leave their 'dance shoes' on a corner.
Rebull and colleagues Ülker have detailed their new analysis of the rotational speeds of the constellation star in three new articles to be published in the Astronomy Journal shortly.
