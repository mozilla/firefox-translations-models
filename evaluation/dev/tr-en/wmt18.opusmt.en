Breaking news: Our Cosmic Visitor Giant Asteroid 2014 JO25
There are billions, maybe even more giant asteroids loose in the solar system that can cause serious consequences when it hits.
These objects, which can have closed or open orbits from the formation of the Sun, can sometimes pass through the Earth.
In 2014 JO25, the asteroid within a distance of 650 meters will pass by at 2:24 p.m., at the nearest location to Earth at 1.75 million km.
We've been hearing this kind of news more and more often.
The most important reason is the improvements in observation techniques and observation devices.
So we have the ability to detect smaller asteroids that have never been identified before.
For example, last January, an asteroid the size of a bus passed through only half of Earth and the Moon (~250,000 km).
And even more interestingly, the asteroid was detected just a few days before the transition.
So there could be other cosmic buses coming at us right now.
Think about it. What would you do if you got word that an asteroid within a 20-metre radius would fall right in the middle of your neighborhood?
As a matter of fact, asteroids this size don't destroy your neighborhood, but the windows of all the buildings will probably explode.
That would be due to shock waves from the asteroid that would explode in the atmosphere.
For example, the asteroid that fell to Russia in 2013 was about this size, and it was enough to tear down windows of buildings in several cities.
But if you have a neighborhood targeting a 100-meter-wide asteroid, your advice is to go at least 30 miles from your neighborhood.
The criteria, such as the size of the asteroid and the angle of impact, are the factors that determine the depth of the crater and the damage the impact will do.
Let's take a look at some scenarios based on the simulation of the European Space Agency.
If a 100-metre-wide asteroid hits the Earth at a 45-degree angle at 60km per second, it will have a crater with a depth of about 250m and an anchor of 1,200m.
The impact is equivalent to an earthquake of six on the Richter scale, and even if you're 10 kilometers from the impact point, you get third degree burns on your body.
30 miles away, the window windows will be smashed.
If an asteroid hits within a mile of it, it becomes even more depressing.
If an asteroid like this hits the Earth with the same angle and speed value, it will create a crater about 600 meters deep and 12 kilometers in diameter.
So a whole neighborhood turns into a crater and disappears instantly.
Even if you're 60 miles from the impact point because of the heat caused by the impact, you get a third degree burn in your body.
The impact is equivalent to an earthquake of 8 on the Richter scale.
The damage to the asteroid depends not only on the chemical composition of the asteroid, but also on the rock structure of the region.
The above values were given in reference to the scenario that occurred when a hard rock-like asteroid fell into a region of sedimentary rock.
If the asteroid is mostly made up of iron, if it falls to a surface with lava cooling, its crater size will increase by threefold, and the disaster that comes from that will endure.
66 million years ago, something worse happened to the dinosaurs, and they were subjected to disaster caused by the impact of an asteroid within a ten-mile radius.
75 percent of marine and land creatures were instantly destroyed by asteroid impact.
If this massive asteroid that destroyed the dinosaurs targeted Earth, I assure you, the best option would be to leave the planet.
A ton of matter falls from space to Earth every day.
Most of them burn up in the atmosphere.
Some asteroids, large enough, burn in the atmosphere, causing flashages known as stargazing amongst the public.
Let's end our article with another comforting piece of news.
Studies show that for the next 300 to 400 years, a giant asteroid is not expected to hit the Earth, causing serious destruction.
As an average 70-year-old creature, I'm sure you're quite relieved.
Flash for Medel: 10 million euros!
The name on the black-and-white agenda that wants to reinforce the stoper zone is Gary Medel, who is considered to be clear of Inter...
The 30-year-old footballer, who went on vacation after playing for the Confederate Cup in his Chilean jersey and started working with Inter recently, is waiting for his next bids.
Gazzetta dello Sport, a prestigious Italian newspaper, said Besiktaş offered Inter 10m euros for both the stoper and the front libero region.
The black-whites who submitted their proposal to Medel said they were expecting answers from both sides, while Chilean footballer was reportedly reluctant to live with his family in Istanbul.
Despite Gazatta's claim, the FFP limitation, Black Eagle, is difficult to pay, such as 10m euros for Medel.
It is possible that the Black-Whites will first move to Medel via rental, as in Caner Erkin's transfer, or add the star player to the cast if there is a serious discount on their service.
Beşiktaş reported the Negredo transfer to the stock market
The human rights group issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Society for Progress of Colored People has issued a warning for colored people to travel to Missouri because of the province's segregation policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: "As the state of Missouri, the NAACP Travel Advice Declaration is valid on August 28, 2017, African-American travellers, visitors, and Missouri residents have recently been suspicious, racial-based events happening across the state, it allows them to pay special attention and to be extremely cautious as they travel from the head of the state to the end of the state as stated."
The NAACP said a new Missouri law makes it difficult for people to win discrimination cases, while at the same time it is effective for the group to publish this travel warning, when the state's law practices target minorities out of proportion.
"There are human rights violations that happen to people.
They are stopped and beaten and killed because of the color of their skin," said Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri NAACP, to Kansan City Star.
"We hear complaints at a rate we've never heard before."
This is the first time the association has issued such a warning for a state in the United States.
The group cited racial insults against black students at Missouri University and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
At the beginning of this year, Sanders was arrested and killed under suspicious circumstances by Missouri police after he ran out of fuel as he passed the state.
The recommendation also points out a new report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the province are likely to be stopped by 75 per cent more than whites.
"The advice statement is to warn people to stay alert and to warn their families, friends and colleagues that they may be in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People should be ready to bring bail money with them, let their relatives know they're going to pass through this state."
In Missouri, according to the latest figures in the FBI's hate crime reporting programme, 100 hate crimes were committed in 2015, which puts the state 16th in terms of the number of similar violations in the country.
A travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law where a business is more difficult to sue for discrimination when renting a dwelling or hiring a job.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Association (ACLU) issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona after local executive authorities passed immigration laws ordering people to arrest people for immigration violations; the ACLU says this will increase the practice of race.
Travel warnings are usually published by the State Department for other countries, but recently, defence groups have been resorting to a number of laws and trends within the United States.
Demba Ba in Beşiktaş over.
Demba Ba, who was transferred to Shanghai Shenhua for 13 million euros two seasons ago and rented to the Black and Whites last season, is returning to Beşiktaş for free.
After a report from the star football player, Black Eagle asked for a detailed medical report from the Senegalese player last week.
The Black and White administration, which began to work for a 32-year-old player the Chinese representative didn't think of next season, knocked on the door of the Shanghai team.
Not listed
Demba Ba, who was not listed for foreign status in China, forwarded to the administration that he wanted to return to the Black-Whites.
The Chinese team approved the departure of the 32-year-old player.
The Senegalese footballer is expected to come to Turkey in the coming days and sign an official contract.
Castillo was operated on in Tripoli.
"Our post-op player, carried out by Prof. Dr. Ugur Rights, is scheduled to begin training with the team within four weeks," the Bordo-Blueli club's website said, noting that Castillo had performed an arthroscopic meniscus operation on his left knee in Istanbul Liv Hospital.
Castillo was injured from his right rear muscle during his preparation match with the Dutch team Heerenveen at the bordello-blue team's Slovakian camp.
The Colombian player, who was announced to have been out of the field for three or four weeks due to his treatment, was also scheduled to be operated on due to a previous meniscus problem.
Referendum exit from Barzan!
Barzani gave a speech at a memorial ceremony in Duhok, which marks the 3rd anniversary of the terrorist organisation DEAŞ's attack on the Ezidis in Sincar district of Mosul.
"I regret to say this, we have no hope that Iraq will become a proper and decent country," Barzani said, referring to the independence referendum the IKBY wants to hold on September 25th.
We've tried all the roads with Iraq, but we're completely helpless and desperate.
Our past experiences with Iraq have put us in this position, and there's no guarantee that we can take our rights and be protected.
So in order to ensure life and security together, we all need to show the world that we can determine our destiny through a referendum.
And I have to emphasize that the referendum is not a goal for us, but a tool for reaching a greater goal.
Noting that the Iraqi central government had made many promises to Kurds after the fall of Baas Rejimi in 2003, Barzani said the disaster in Sincar soon came to pass, saying a direct referendum was made following the fight against the DEAS.
"It has come out with documents that Iraq can't protect us or protect us like a state," Barzani said, saying that the people of the ICBY want to establish its fate peacefully and democratically for its self-preservation and development.
"He doesn't want us to move forward."
During the fight against the terrorist organisation DEAŞ, Barzani noted that the Iraqi central government had not given them weapons, but in a short period of time, Hashi Shabi, founded with a fetish, reacted immediately that all weapons had been obtained and provided.
In Iraq's defense system, Pesmerge was not dealt with.
The central government didn't do to Pesmerge what it offered to Hashdi Shabi.
Pesmerge is considered part of Iraq's defence system according to the constitution.
However, when Hasdi Shabi did not exist in the constitution, laws were violated and all possibilities were mobilized.
We're not saying we're against the Hasdi Shabi.
Pesmerge and Hashi Shabi fought on the same front, so why is Hashi Shabi being legalized while the existence and the struggle against terror is being covered up?
These are our deep wounds with Baghdad.
On 3 August 2014, the terrorist organization DEAŞ launched an attack on the Ezidis living in Sincar district of Mosul, killing many people including women and children.
Back from disaster by 10 minutes.
According to the BBC, the Boeing 777 Air France airline passenger plane was in the air, while North Korea's missile was in the air, west of Hokkaido, northern Japan.
The missile crashed into the area where it was located 10 minutes ago, officials said, adding that the missile was estimated to be within 100-150km of the plane.
Air France reported that the missile did not intercept the plane's route, and there was no problem with the flight in question.
"The information we have at this stage indicates that the missile crashed into the sea more than 100km from the plane's route," the statement added.
Is nothing sacred?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most precise sign of a regime change is that they start attacking statues.
The Americans know just as well as any of them, that Saddam Hussein, carefully engineered, was toppled at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key theorists of the Trump regime, knew exactly what he was doing when he was symbolically destroying the Statue of Liberty in a heated debate between CNN's Jim Acosta and the president's offer to strongly restrict legal migration.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue itself.
If he did, he'd have been lynched by a lot of boat owners and freedom impersonators.
But he attacked its meaning, and especially in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed, Emma Lazarus' famous poem was attributed to it after it was added to the base of the monument.
As Miller went up to Acosta, he said, "I don't want to talk about history from beginning to end here, but the Statue of Liberty... is a symbol of American freedom that makes no light to the world.
The poem you speak of has been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller's actually right, but as he said himself, it's not really about history.
This is about the modern reverberation of Lazarus' frightening words, not only does a state invite not only some elderly immigrants but also the poor one: "The tired, the poor, the crammed masses desire to breathe freedom, / the wretched unwantedness of the crowded land."
There's never been a time when it's so visible on our screens that you don't want to see a Thursday.
Miller did not bring literary criticism; he explained that people were not welcome in Trump's United States.
The conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: this is actually a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus and his friends who campaigned to put his words on the base of the statue after his death knew very well that they had entered a political action.
The statue intended to celebrate the links between French and American republican, in a stereotype, in the form of freedom in the form of a woman.
Lazarus changed the meaning: The female figure in his poem was no longer abstract, but had a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The marriage of poetry to image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American anti-immigrantism.
And just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have wanted to change it back for a long time.
For Trump's arrival, big-time Baptist John bullshitter Rush Limbaugh argued that in 2010 Liber8 didn't invite anyone in, but it was mostly an early neocon that kept American fire in the dark.
He exists to transport the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
Not to light the road to the United States of America."
In a very unusual way, Limbaugh had actually discovered something.
The meaning of the statue was all about perception.
Lazarus'wonderful creative act was to see it as seen after a long and often terrible journey by exhausted, but hopeful people on the ship's decks.
It was really about seeing the world through the perspective of people looking for refuge and trying to improve their lives.
His statue responded to them with words of hope and a warm welcome that they needed to hear.
Of course, it's not a perspective that Miller and Trump will find justified in any way.
Their torch is not to guide, but to provoke their only source of power, their hatred.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle remembers when only two Scots made the Great Britain team.
Neil Black, director of U.K. Athletic performance, says the 16-member Scottish team in the World Championship will "make a huge contribution to the team."
The record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which began on Friday.
Black believes that something is developing in Scotland and that the United Kingdom athletics should learn from it.
"We embrace it, and we try to understand it, and we'll work until we get out of it," Black said.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it has something to do with what they're doing.
Scottish Athletics thinks it has something to do with what they're doing.
Britain's athleticism: She thinks it's about what they do.
So is the guy in the corner alley.
Whatever the combination of conditions is, it's absolutely wonderful."
Laura Muir and many Scottish athletes, including Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah at 5,000 m, were selected as captains by Eilidh Doyle.
"Eilidh is a bit modest.
The captain's speech was incredible," Black said.
"No matter where they live or train in Scotland, a few athletes were very proud and very motivated in that room.
Eilidh's natural sense of passion and true emotion was wonderful."
The silver medalist athlete from the Commonwealth, who will compete in 400m in the fifth World Championship, says 16 Scots are "unbelievable" to be on the British team.
The best total athletes in Scotland's previous world championships were seven in 1983 and 2015.
Five Britannias and two European record-breaking mid-distance runners Muir led last year.
He'll be at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Chris O'Hare is another Scot who has had a very good season, including the British Team trials and the victory of the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first championship as Lee McConnell, the only other Scotsman on the team.
The team captain says many citizens are "very proud" in action, since they will not only join the team, but in some cases they will compete for the medal and will compete for the finals.
"The special thing about being team captain is that it was voted by other members of the team, so it was already a huge honor, but knowing that your teammates voted for you and chose you made it extra special for me," he added.
"Honestly, I'm proud of all the Scots who made the team.
That's how far we've come.
And they're here as self-proved athletes, athletes looking to get on the podium.
And the captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I took advantage of the fact that we're very lucky in this situation, in a sense, there's a World Championship in our house.
I mean, it's really just the effect of being able to take advantage of this inner field support and the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I'm getting a second chance to get up there and fight, and there's gonna be such a great atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for government office if you can't handle voters' criticism
Our country's father knew a little bit about being negative in the press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to start critical of everything from internal politics to political principles.
Of course he was offended by the criticism.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be eliminated, and we can be dragged into a foolish and silent slaughter."
This brings me to Larry Hogan, governor of Maryland, who needs to work harder to be like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted at least 450 people from sharing their ideas on his official Facebook page.
The American League of Civil Liberties sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff ignored the case on the grounds that it was nonsensical, and online comments were filled with "who cares?" reactions.
A lot of people said, "It's just Facebook."
But it's important.
It's especially important when you're someone like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor who's surprisingly popular in a overwhelmingly democratic state.
It has the second highest approval rate of 50 governors in the country.
Hogan's not a reactionary lunatic.
He's been skilled in leading his state and strict devotion to principles.
He was also very skilled at using Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his constituents by presenting his hairless head as a joke after chemo.
So it's unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to stop people from coming to the Governor's page, which is a public forum, which is officially described as a public forum, and is run by members of the government whose tax dollars are paid.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's female spokesman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions, claiming it was more than just editing comments.
But it's easy to use images of trolls or spamers or haters attacking online verbally.
The Post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are real people who only speak to their elected leader: a teacher, a business owner and a priest, not a troll.
They all said their comments weren't respectful, thoughtful and abusive.
In his share, the priest quoted from the Bible, addressing Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, a lawyer from Bowie, in Maryland, was not full of hate, but asked about hate crimes.
"I have kindly made a comment that I am disappointed that he has failed to respond to hate crimes and other recent news reports," he wrote in The Post's comment.
"I also don't like the idea that when many people comment on the same issue, it's more a collective effort than just a large group of concerned citizens."
Others will probably refer to the governor's staff as "intensified Spam Attack."
The Facebook period makes it easier to adapt a message by preventing an opponent or deleting a negative message.
It's much cleaner than the old days when the staff was sent out to collect and burn newspapers with critical writings or arrest protesters and silence them.
But, even if it's digital, that's exactly what's happening.
Hogan is not the first public task to be criticised for defusing Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by Twitter flow.
One of the decisions that could be referred to in the future came last week from Virginia.
According to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, the chairman of the Board of Controllers of Loudoun's Management District acted against the First Amendment when he banned a voter from Facebook.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin was visited by the ACLU for Facebook and Twitter use.
It shouldn't be that hard.
Back in Washington, the affordable postal era had a very similar effect on the Internet.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and the anonymous letterwriters wore him out.
Even then, Washington had unknown trolls.
All the people who used aliases such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to the newspapers that overwhelmed Washington's decisions.
According to the George Washington Articles Project, which collected historical documents, his office was overwhelmed by petitions that criticised his stance on the Friendship, Trade and Navigation Agreement with Britain.
But he didn't shut them up.
Freedom of expression, opposition and debate is at the heart of our nation.
That's what real leadership means.
Ronan Rafferty hopes his house will be comfortable at the Renaissance Club.
The former number one in Europe, Ronan Rafferty, hopes that in the next three days, the Renaissance Club in South Lothian will be comfortable while hosting the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open.
Before losing to Paul Eales at Archerfield Links, the Northern Irishman, leading the next door to the final, feels committed to the new venue and acts as ambassador to the tournament for Jerry Sarvadi, the founder of the club and CEO of the club.
"I watched the Renaissance Club be built, and with this organization we see its glory."
The players will see the field at its best, in an extraordinary situation.
Jerry did a remarkable job setting this place up.
He's a tireless defender of this game, and he's proud of his success here.
It's a great show for this field."
Although the British Eagles have won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour, they will fight for the first time in their 32-year career to save a championship.
"This feels really special," said the Southport-based player.
"I never had a chance to protect the Extremadura Open because it was removed from the calendar after the year I won.
It's good to be back in this part of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
It brings back memories from last year, and it was very special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.
It's really special and it's a time we'll always remember with love."
At the beginning of this year, Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50, is back in the game.
This event will be the first Scottish competition since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"When you fight inside, it always means a little bit more," said Helensburgh man Orr.
"You want to do well, but you also feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played some real golf.
I'm happy to go so far."
In the field are former Masters champions Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots in the field; others Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participants are free and parking; £5 per car with one person and £10 per car with two or more people.

I found the answer.
Imagine a seat... a budget of 6 billion 867 million Turkish liras, with more than a budget for each of the 11 ministries, including Economy, Development, Energy and Resources, Science Industry and Technology, Environment and Urbanism, Health, Culture and Tourism Ministrys!
The staff count is 117,378.
Turkey's largest propaganda base!
Yes, I'm talking about the President of the Religious Affairs!
Yes, I'm going to talk about Mr. Mehmet Gormez!
For days, I've been looking for answers to the question in my head.
I wonder the real reason Mehmet Gormez was removed from his seat...
I've read every article about her being sent.
No.
I can't seem to find the answer to the question I'm looking for.
At the beginning of this year...
Mehmet Gormaz prepared the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan of the President of the Religious Affairs (DİB).
A S600 Mercedes, worth $1 million, was drawn under it by President Erdogan.
So he didn't have a problem with Erdogan.
So what happened?
You could say, "It's not enough that he's been on duty for seven years."
The first DIB President, M. Rifat Bövekcı, served 17 years.
The Mehmet Nuri Yilmaz you all know has been in that chair for 11 years.
So... the president's mandate is open.
Back to my question: why did Mehmet Görmez leave his seat?
It's up to you...
Nearness of the Shiite
The source close to power said: "By tradition, Mehmet Günz didn't claim circumcision!"
The code for this sentence is: it did not possess circumcision!
The person who said this sentence then skips: "He has been found a modernist by traditional ulema!"
I mean, Mehmet Gormaz seemed innovative.
What do you mean, innovative?
The answer was hidden on a trip abroad by Mehmet Gormez.
Date: December 27, 2015.
Mehmet Gormaz went to Iran to attend the 29th Vahdet Conference -- which aims to bring Islam's sects closer together -- in Tehran.
He met with Ayatollah Ali Hamaney, Iran's religious leader.
And he kept the prayer established with the people of the Shu'aib.
And at the conference, he said, "Members are human beings who represent different ideas and opinions in the understanding of Islamic religion."
The purpose of all is to set their course towards God.
Each of them is on a high road, but its destination is the same.
It's never acceptable to see religion equal to religion or to see the order of religion above the Islamic heritage.
It's a reflection of a cult-based segregation, aberration, and conflict, and ignorance.
The religion itself has suffered the most in the case of the sects leading the way of religion.
I'd like to underline here:
The Shiites and the Sunnis are one nation.
"No one can condemn another because he understands Islam the way he understands it and he doesn't."
A year later...
Only Jaferi leader Selahattin of Turkey attended the 30th Vahdet Assembly in June.
So...
It's not circumcision. It's Vehabiness.
Mehmet Gormez's trip to Iran and his speech at the conference made him the target of "traditional evaluation."
This is why no one -- again -- represented the Turkish State -- attended the next Tehran conference.
Mehmet Görmaz had not been invited four times since he was in office.
The reason was obvious: the Shii - anti-Iran "traditional ulema" in DIB.
Right after the Iranian trip, Mehmet Görmez's seat began to wear down from the beginning of 2016.
In the beginning was Deputy Prime Minister Numan Survivor, in charge of the DIB!
Mehmet Gormez drowned so much that he wanted to be connected to the DIB presidency.
The bottom line is...
There was a difference within the government about the way they looked at circumcision.
Some of their theoretical worlds were created in Saudi Arabia and Egypt's meds, which identified the "traditional ulema" with the Sunni -- the U.S. shadow -- the Vehhabi-Selephiness!
They were anti-Irans who couldn't even tolerate a trip to Tehran.
It was not surprising what Ahmet of the robe said about Mehmet Görmez: "There is no danger to the Diet.'
"My Lord will grant me a good leader who will be loyal to the people and will be loyal to the people of their homes."
They used "Ehlisinnet" as a symbol of Iranian hostility.
At one point, the anti-Israeli opposition -- supported by the CIA -- was now under new names.
And with the plots...
A photo of a young man with whiskey was presented to the media with a lie about "Mehmet Gormez's son"!
What a coincidence!
Who made the biggest opposition to Mehmet Gormaz in the media: Turkey is the newspaper of the U.S. Lighters Community!
After all...
- The one who refuses to bring the circumcision to the Saudi Vehhabi-Selefi line...
- That doesn't fuel the separation of the sect...
- Modernist... a man of the cloth, their consciousness was destroyed by the traditional ulema created during the Cold War...
US cultural imperialism continues to quickly Arabise Turkey (the Vehhabi-Selefi).
Don't doubt that the next President of Religious Affairs will become a Wahibi-Selephire representative!
"We support Turkey's sovereignty"
Foreign Minister Mevlüt Sargeglu has gone to China for a formal visit.
Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi held a joint press conference at the State Guesthouse in Beijing.
"We hope Turkey will be more active in international matters."
China will support Turkey in its efforts to preserve sovereignty, stability and security.
"As for the Palestinian, we hope it will be resolved with the international community, including Turkey," he said.
"Turkey is seeking close co-operation with regional and international organisations, international organisations are not the alternative, they are the complement of each other," he said regarding the Shanghai Co-operation Organization.
The spirit officially begins its second term.
Hasan Ruhani's presidency, which won the May presidential elections in Iran, was approved by the country's leader, Ayatollah Ali Hamaney.
Hasan Ruhani, who was elected president for the second time in Iran, took an oath at the ceremony attended by the country's religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Hamaney.
Turkey's Tehran Ambassador Riza Hakan Tekin participated in a ceremony attended by top military and political figures, as well as foreign representatives.
Ruhani, who will serve as president for another four years, will officially take office after an oath ceremony in parliament on Saturday (August 5th).
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci, representing Turkey, is expected to attend the ceremony.
Security measures at the Cilve-Eye Border Gate
Other than humanitarian aid, food, medicine, cleaning materials in Reyhanlı district of Hatay, Cilvegözü will not be allowed to pass through the Border Gate.
According to information, the Babel Air Border Gate and its area have been closed to transports other than the Cilveg Eye Border Gate, humanitarian aid, food, medicine and cleaning clause, due to negative security conditions near Turkey's border.
Help trucks are allowed to exit through the Cilve-Eye Border Gate.
There was no information as to how long the limitation would take.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Gold Land
Bardina Degei doesn't use a stove when she cooks.
He rarely even uses a pot.
The housewife puts a sweet potato, commonly known as "nota," directly on fire, in her wooden house at Enarotali, Paniai regent, in the restless region of Indonesia.
Half an hour later, they're harvested and wiped with appetite, hands unwashed.
Degei is sitting on the muddy floor where he does chores like do laundry with the blurry water from the nearby swamp, and he doesn't have any furniture.
It's like a bucket of field halls in the roofless house.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was never given a job in any field.
Polygamy is normal here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most of the men in the village are unemployed and most of them drink too much, and there are soldiers.
"No one wanders around the village after 5:00 p.m."
A rare glimpse of daily life in the mountains of Papua, an old Dutch colony that was absorbed by Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, where only 1026 seniors were forced to vote by force before the invasion.
A current movement, which promotes independence against the Dutch administration, quickly directed its anger towards Jakarta's government, which prohibits foreign journalists or rights surveillance organisations, which maintain firm control over the region.
In 2003, the region was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, where independent Papua New Guinea would occupy the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is, and the journey here includes a 90-minute flight from the regional capital of Jayapura to Nabire and a five-hour car that shakes up the stomach in a rental car.
No public transportation.
The city of 19,000 people includes wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, with crumpled iron roofs turned by rust into various yellowish brown tones.
Let alone journalists, very few Indonesians have traveled here and hardly any foreigners have traveled here.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago worshipped the Papuans, a god called Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," Degei says, referring to his colorful, hand-touched turban, dark shirt, and shiny skirt.
"We used to only wear leaves on our bodies."
Papua is the poorest region in Indonesia, where 28% of the people live below the poverty line and have the worst children's death and literary rates in Asia.
But at the same time, this is Indonesia's land of gold.
Grasberg, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world owned by the Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a mountain area of the size of New Jersey, home to 153,000 people.
Only in 2015, Freeport pulled out about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has estimated $78 billion in lumber reserves.
However, these riches, a source of misery for the Papuans, help Indonesia's powerful army to maintain a suffocating presence.
The New York Times' 2005 study says Freeport paid local military personnel and units about 20 million dollars between 1998 and 2004, including the sums of $150,000 to a single officer.
The Papua call for more autonomy threatens this golden egging chicken and is mercilessly denied its rights.
According to rights defenders, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by the Indonesian army since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
Mass massacres in the mountains of Papua in the 1970s reached the number of genocides, according to the Asian Commission for Human Rights.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful demonstrators in the area last year alone.
The Archbishopate of Brisbane's 2016 report "We Will Lose Everything" includes the testimony of previous year's illegal executions, torture, and the brutal crush of peaceful demonstrations, particularly by rape and electrocution, according to another report.
"It's hard to calculate the number of victims because there are incidents every week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
Because Papua's resources have brought settlers from other parts of Indonesia, the pressures have been increased.
The population of 3.5 million people is 83% Christian, but the demographic changes as Muslim immigrants from Indonesia's crowded islands Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi come for economic purposes.
Javaese warung buffets sell gado-gado mixed with fried chicken and vegetables and served with peanut sauce.
Locals are having a hard time competing.
"Migrations sell chickens and vegetables cheaper in traditional markets than local Papuas," explains Abeth You, 24 years old, a native of Paniai, who moved to Jayapura, the regional capital.
"This caused local Papuans to lose their Papuan mama-mama (women) market."
In the 2014 election campaign, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised to solve the inequalities and rights violations in Papua.
As the former carpenter headed for the presidential palace in Jakarta, he took 27 of the 29 regions of Papua, including Panaia.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, hoping that justice would be restored," He says.
In fact, Paniai suffered his worst condition just two months after Jokowi's deployment in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside, singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali, and two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on the motorcycle.
Scared kids told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers resented his style and later returned with four soldiers, according to the local priest Yavedt Tebai.
The victims and witnesses said that the soldiers who drank alcohol chased the group and beat them with their rifles' bottoms.
Then one of the soldiers fired at the children's group.
One of the children, a 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten that he went into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government election commission building was set on fire, and the following day, the events escalated.
About 1,000 Papuan men, women and children gathered to demand justice on a football field in front of the local police station and military command center.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and danced the waita dance of Papua's Mee Pago tribe (run in the form of the people and imitated the bird's singing).
Some protesters started throwing stones at the police and the military garrison.
"If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them to death." That's what TIME's official document, which is not explained to local media.
Jeremias Kayame, head of the Kego Koto neighborhood in Enarotali, saw the approaching danger and called upon the crowd to come home, demanding peace.
No one had any intention of listening.
"When I turned around, I suddenly got shot in the left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his bright-colored wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired the shot, but he says the bullet came from a collected military era.
"It was a crowd, multiple shots were fired," he adds.
According to his cousin, who witnessed the attacks, local Alfius Youw was shot three times.
Like many Indonesians, Yohanes, known only by one name, told TIME in a pessimistic way: "I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it wasn't him."
"I saw him die... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers had only "secured" the police station, because the police station was under attack.
"When people threaten to kill us, we have to defend ourselves," said Ppua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistio in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
The news of the deaths reached Jakarta only the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an exuberant speech in Jayapura, pledging to share the pain of the families of the victims, promising to solve historical abuses in Papua.
"I want this case solved immediately so it doesn't happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an illegal mechanism for historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the violations happened a long time ago.
Some in the '90s and some in the early 2000s.
The point is that we are determined to solve these violations, but we have processes to go through," he said.
Speaking to TIME on June 5th, Wiranto backed down, saying he had no plans to build a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "They'll all be solved by the law."
Wiranto, whom the U.N. accused of over 1,000 crimes against humanity during East Timor's 1999 vote for bloody independence, said 11 human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai incident, have already been solved.
The families of the victims of Paniai welcomed such claims with bitter scepticism.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
He says, "I'm scared."
"I'm afraid of being arrested by soldiers, I'm afraid of getting shot."
His brother Yacobus repeats his opinion that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the matter.
He says he was beaten by a soldier after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the soldier came looking for me."
The attacks haven't stopped yet.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the villagers at the Deiyai regency of Paniai's neighbor.
During the conflict between the villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help take an unconscious man to the hospital, one person was killed and 17 others were injured, including children.
24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned in a nearby lake while fishing, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's construction office.
The police said the villagers threw stones at the officers, and they reacted by firing a warning shot.
But locals say the mobile brigade (indonesian paramilitary police) fired on the crowd and killed someone.
Dominggu Badii TIME, 29, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the raising of wounded, says, "We were so panicked, we feared revenge would be taken."
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament called for the responsibility of the officers involved and for the withdrawal of the mobile police brigade from the region.
Paniai has always been a troubled area for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development fuels the dissatisfaction of the peoples of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in disarray across the green mountain centre of Papua.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), claiming to protect the Papuas' rights by random attacks and by raiding Indonesian soldiers.
Some top OPM leaders, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya, are coming from Paniai.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and have been kept arbitrary in recent years by the military under the guise of "protecting national sovereignty."
Some are never seen again.
Among the peoples of Papua, Paniai is known as a "tragic and forgotten place."
Poverty feeds on dissatisfaction.
A little rice in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.
The bread is unreachable.
People here grow everything they eat: primarily, as well as note, some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is for women who can sustain four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, and they sell the rest for the local market.
Ten notes only amount to 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
In time, economic inequalities among local Papuans and new immigrants have increased since the opening of new air routes to Nabire Airport.
Things that are already scarce usually go to immigrants who are better educated and richer.
The Papuas rarely have the capitals or the necessary qualities to run their own competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there is no work or money here," says John Gobai, head of the Panai tribal council.
Lockdown keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Other than that, the reporting restrictions for the international media stand firm.
Earlier this year, French journalist Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua due to "a lack of co-ordination with interested institutions," despite their rare permission to shoot video.
According to Human Rights Watch Deputy Asian Director Phelim Kine, Jokowi's commitments to reporting and development were not met to increase his election campaign transparency.
In one statement, he said: "There are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Papua and West Papua from the restless eastern provinces of Indonesia: visas have not been rejected and blacklisted."
No press inspection means international pressure on the Indonesian government is often limited to its neighbours near Papua.
In March, six Pacific nations (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands) encouraged the U.M. Council of Human Rights to investigate "different and common violations" in Papua, including the Panaia attacks.
The same countries historically support the OPM.
"The democratic system in Indonesia is still valid and free media, so the evidence in human rights cases is hard to cover up," Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir told reporters in Jakarta.
Locals want more foreign governments to deal with it.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands visited Jayapura on May 4th, headed by the country's human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, the locals broke their silence by begging for "freedom," according to a source who attended the meeting and did not want to be named.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say it's unlikely they'll ever vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai attack," said Gobai, head of the tribal council.
Jokowi wants the people of Paniai to know that he's rolling in poverty with poor education and health care, except to live under the threat of a violent soldier.
Like other Papuans, the people of Paniai see their vote as a "borrow" to pay back Jokowi, Gobai says.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai attack carried out a final symbolic act of resistance: burying a victim's body in the field opposite the police and military outpost.
Knowing that justice may never be done, they'll make sure at least those responsible remember their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus, head down.
"What else can we do?"
The fire engulfed Dubai's 'light' skyscraper for the second time
On Friday in Dubai, a fire scorched the world's highest residential towers and forced hundreds of residents to flee the 79-story structure 337 metres long.
This is the second major fire in two years that has spread rapidly into the high building called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no explanation for the cause of the big fire.
"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm, and people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor." That's what a resident called George spoke to Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said the fire brigade extinguished the fire at local time around 4:00 AM (00 GMT) and were cooling the building.
The government said they were trying to provide shelter for the affected.
This could raise questions about the safety of material used on the outsides of high buildings worldwide.
The investigation of the torch management following the fire in 2015 found that most of the damage was in the exterior panels used for decoration and isolation.
Police in the United Kingdom say they believe that London's isolation and coating panel system on the Grenfell Tower, where 80 people died, may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June.
News of'social aid' for more than 4,000 chronic patients
At the first stage, 4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients will benefit from the welfare programme for poor citizens and their families who are struggling with chronic diseases by the Ministry of Family and Social Policy.
The ministry will also provide regular psychosocial support, which plans to give patients more than two-thirds of the minimum wage.
According to information, details and implementation of the New Social Aid Programme for Family and Social Policy Minister Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, whose work began a while ago under the direction of his Minister of Family and Social Policy Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya.
The social welfare programme, launched to support citizens who are struggling with chronic illness in their cooperation with the Ministry of Health, is, in many ways, the first in the world.
The Ministry, which has completed all preparations for the launch of the programme, will provide not only cash but regular psychosocial support for the families through the welfare programme.
Thus, poor citizens who have chronic illness and who continue their treatments in their homes are targeted not to be left both financially and spiritually alone.
According to studies, at the first stage, poor citizens struggling with Subakut Sklerozan Panensefalit (SSPE), a brain disease caused by tuberculosis and measles, will receive regular psychosocial and cash support as part of the new social aid programme.
In the next phase of the programme, poor citizens fighting other rare and risky diseases will be included in the aid programme.
More than two-thirds of the minimum wage is expected to be paid, as well as additional payments to tuberculosis patients who have been detected by the health department's relevant health department for their lack of medical care, whose life is dependent on the bed, or the need to improve the conditions of living at home.
In order to receive support, the household is required that the minimum monthly income per person should be less than two thirds per month.
In addition, citizens of the SSPE patients need to have a health board report issued according to procedure and fundamentals in "Responsibility Measurement, Classification and Health Board Reports for Retardees."
According to the survey, more than 1 out of 5 US passengers bring banned substances to the plane.
According to the survey conducted by airline passengers, more than 20 per cent deliberately or unawarely smuggled banned substances from the control points of the US Transport Security Agency into the plane, including at least 6 per cent, including an unknowingly banned knife or other sharp objects.
Less than 1% later claimed to have noticed that he was traveling with firearms, ammunition, or explosives by mistake.
Research conducted by a jet charter service called Stratos Jet Charters has also found that more than 1,000 young passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the participants who admit to deliberately trying to fly with something forbidden by the TSA, 19.7 per cent are members of the Y generation, whereas less than 15 are members of the X generation.
The most common items taken from TSA agents are food and fluids.
More than 3% of the women's participants knowingly admitted that they were passing sharp instruments through security, while 2.2 per cent of the attendees and 3.7 of the male participants agreed that they were deliberately carrying banned drugs onto the plane.
The company said how many people from airport security accidentally brought contraband and polled passengers across the country to find out how many of them did it on purpose.
It's no surprise that the most likely people to smuggle contraband through security on purpose or not are the ones who are flying the most.
However, as the firm stated, the TSA rules are a bit complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure of what fluids or how much of them they can carry.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of material confiscated by the TSA came out as forbidden fluids.
For a while, people thought the TSA might be treating books as contraband.
Fluids are allowed on domestic flights, but international ones are not allowed.
China welcomed US statements
At a press conference in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi said "We are not seeking an excuse for Tillerson's change of regime, the collapse of the regime, the rapid reunification of the peninsula and for sending our troops north of the 38th parallel."
Chinese Foreign Minister Vang said that Tillerson reiterated the principles of Washington's administration on the matter of North Korea, hoping that the United States will implement these principles effectively and effectively and in a concrete outcome-oriented policy.
Noting that the security of the Korean peninsula is a priority, Vang stressed that the parties expect them to find a middle way to resolve their concerns through equal dialogue, and that the Beijing administration has been insisting from time to time that the partition can be purged of nuclear, peace and stability, and problems can be resolved by dialogue and negotiations.
EPA President Pruitt stopped delaying Obama Emission Laws
A day after being sued by 15 states, the head of the Environmental Protection Organization, Scott Pruitt, rejected the decision earlier to delay the implementation of Obama-era laws, which dropped air pollutant emissions that caused bad smoke.
Pruitt represented the change as his organization was more sensitive to the needs of state environmental regulators than the past administrations.
He never mentioned the legal objection to his previous position in a federal supreme court.
The issue is that states begin to meet October 1st, the end of 2015 standards for the ground level ozone.
Pruitt announced to his organisation that he would postpone harmonisation one year in June to give his organisation more time to work on the plan and to avoid "interventing local decisions or prevent economic growth."
Prior to being appointed by President Donald Trump, Pruitt, Oklahoma's state's attorney, served as a trusted ally for long periods of stricter environmental arrangement.
Ever since Pruitt arrived in Washington, he has moved repeatedly to prevent or delay regulations against chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change is Pruitt's latest legal defeat for resuscitation.
Last month, a federal supreme court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator's attempt to delay the application demanding that oil and gas companies, a Obama management law, control and reduce methane spills, is beyond the limits of his own authority.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt said his return to ozone standards has only strengthened the EPA's commitment to meet new standards with states on time and to work through complex processes.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA often fails to meet the deadlines of decisions, waits to be sued by activist groups and others, and agrees to settle the dispute to set the timing for the decision," Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job, said.
"We don't believe in organizing through litigation, and we take the dates of the term seriously.
We also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously."
Nevertheless, the EPA's statement said Pruitt could once again use his "returning authority and all legal authority" to ensure that regulations are "supported by sound policies and the best information available."
The Republicans in Congress are pressing for a wider rewrite of the ozone laws.
A parliamentary bill adopted last month strives to delay the implementation of the laws of 2015 for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to the Senate for a vote.
New York chief prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states suing the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue the legal pressure.
"After our cases, the change of decision by the EPA is an important gain for the health and safety of more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by 6.7 million New Yorkers and the dirty smoke flowing into their communities," Schneiderman said.
The case drew entry from New York City, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
When common pollutants are released by automobiles, power plants, oil refinerys, chemical plants and other sources reacting to sunlight in the atmosphere, ozone is created at ground level.
Dirty smoke can cause serious breathing problems in a group of people who are easily affected and contributes to thousands of early deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists applauded Pruitt's surprise decision change.
Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Variety said: "It is disturbing that so much pressure is needed from the person in charge of protecting the air we breathe."
"We must continue to fight against the ideological struggle of the Trump administration to corrupt the environment and to flatter the groups of interests."
Inflation single digits
Turkey, which achieved its biggest increase in exports in July, attracting unemployment by 13 per cent in January to 10.5 per cent in April, and the economic trust index rose to the peak of 3.5 years, and reduced inflation to one household.
According to data released yesterday by the Turkish Statistical Agency (TÜİK), the consumer Price Index (TÜFE) rose by 0.15 per cent in July, while annual inflation has landed in the single house for the first time since January at 9.79 per cent.
As of the main spending groups in July, the highest increase per month-on-month was 1.75 per cent in the restaurant and hotels group, while the group, which dropped the most, became clothes and shoes at 3.51 per cent.
The highest year-on-year increase occurred at 15.24 per cent in the transport group.
"There is a decline in prices of food and clothing in the moderate course in inflation," Business Investment Economist Muammer Coalcuoglu noted in July, in line with expectations.
But the core indicators have a rise compared to the previous moon, unlike the headline.
He said, "We don't expect any relief in the firm stance of the Central Bank."
Despite the decline in headline inflation, the core inflation indicators have risen.
The B index has risen from 9.07 per cent to 9.46 per cent from 9.20 per cent from 9.60 per cent from 9.7 per cent to 9.60 per cent from special TÜFE indicators watched closely by the Central Bank.
"The inflation could fluctuate until December and fall into a single house in December," said Capital FX Research Assistant Director Enver Erkan, who said inflation could be closed from 9.3 per cent of the year.
"The Central Bank may have an opportunity in the early months of 2018," he said.
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek: Inflation will close the end of the year in one household.
The central bank's tightening will continue until inflation drops below 7 per cent.
We'll give reforms its final form at the nearby Food Committee.
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci: We are pleased that inflation has fallen to a single digit, but it has to be permanent.
In the fight against inflation, food prices need to be lowered, as well as the supply needs to be increased.
Development Minister Lütfi Elvan: Because of its base effect in the coming months, there may be some upward trends in annual inflation, but as of the first 2018 months, the decline in inflation will be evident.
We estimate annual inflation will go even lower.
I wish Fenerbahçe the best of luck in his next match.
Sturm Graz Technical Director Franco Foda said their performance in the second half of the match with Fenerbahçe was not enough to skip a round in the UEFA European League 3rd qualifying round.
"We couldn't use the wings in the first half," Foda said at a press conference after the meeting.
In the second half, we balanced the game.
We got lucky with the second goal.
I'm still proud of my team.
They changed the game in the second half.
We could have been a little better.
Little things got decided in the game.
"I wish Fenerbahçe the best of luck in their next match," he said.
As long as they are in Turkey, they feel very well and are happy with the hospitality they see, Foda said.
Fernando is in Istanbul.
Brazilian footballer Fernando Francisco Reges, where the Galatasaray Club began its transfer talks, arrived in Istanbul.
The Brazilian footballer who arrived at Ataturk Airport received the fans enthusiastically.
Fernando left the airport in a special vehicle waiting for him under security, where the yellow-red fans cheered for love.
Fernando, 30, who started his career in Brazil's Vila Nova team, plays for Estrela Amadora, Porto and Manchester City, is a midfielder.
The Brazilian footballer is expected to sign a contract with the yellow-red team after his medical examination.
Galatasaray, who continued his transfer work, reached an agreement with Manchester City for 5,250,000 euros for Fernando, whom he had long tried to recruit.
The U.S. Flash Rakka move: Homeland Security Force...
Colonel Dillon, who was linked to the US Defence Ministry (Pentagon) through the video conference administration from Baghdad, said that the Rakka Homeland Security Force (RIGG) trained by the coalition has begun to settle in areas that have been cleared of DEAS in the city.
"The Rakka Homeland Security Force, mostly Arab and local volunteers against DEAS, continues to maintain order and prevent terrorists from escaping or returning from the city," Dillon said.
Another 230 people have completed their training this week, and have joined the group, Dillon said, adding that "for now the number of forces in question is 850."
Dillon said the coalition taught the group basic weapons training, as well as first aid, armed conflict, scanning and checkpoint operations.
The coalition will continue to scan applicants for education and employment, he said, adding that you are very interested in the Homeland Security Force.
The US-led coalition is co-operating with the Syrian Democratic Forces, where the PYD/PKK has established its main backbone in the taking of Rakka.
The PYD/PKK terrorist group appointed a PKK terrorist named Layla Muhammad as co-chair of the Rakka civil administration council.
The military force in Rakka is also alleged to be members of the PKK/PYD.
Dillon also announced that last week, the US-led coalition cut off its support, collecting heavy weapons from the opposition group Shoheda Karyatin (Shuhuk) at the camp of Al Tanif in southern Syria.
"After meeting with their leaders last week, Shuhuk returned the heavy weapons and equipment the coalition gave them, but some small weapons and light vehicles were allowed to remain with them," Dillon said.
Last week, the U.S. announced its support from Shuhuk on the grounds that it went out of its non-conflict zones with Russia and was on patrol and involved in non-combative activities with the DEAS.
The group wants to fight against the DEAŞ as well as the Bekar Esed regime.
According to the leaky phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico to pay the border wall.
Phone calls between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia were leaked by the Washington Post.
During a telephone call with Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto on January 27th, Trump urged him not to publicly say that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The president of the United States scolded the president of Mexico, who publicly held the wall, and rumoredly said, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump launched the presidential campaign to build a wall along the southern border of the United States, and promised Mexico that he would pay for the project.
Notes of his first meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who revealed a heated dialogue were also published.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that the deal for the United States to take refugees to Australia was "mad" and "stupid" and "stupid" and that the deal under Obama would make him look like a "budala" after offering a ban on putting a refugee in the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the conversation by telling Mr. Turnbull, "That was the most unpleasant conversation I've had all day."
Patients broke the doctor's nose.
Doctors and staff at Turkey's Higher Education Education and Research Hospital left a short-term job yesterday morning in an effort to react to the beatings of a doctor's friends by their relatives.
The crowd gathered in front of the main entrance of the hospital with the "no violence in health" they carried in their hands, reacting to the incident.
Prof. Dr. Feyza Aysenur Paç, the hospital's Head of the Children's Cardiology Clinic, "No to Violence in Health" slogan sounds inadequate to me, even to me."
There's no place for violence in health.
"If this goes on, these people will soon find no health group to serve themselves," he said.
Ankara County Health Director Dr. Kamil Türkmen, Ankara First District Public Hospitals Secretary General Prof. Dr. Öner Odabaş, Turkish High Institute for Education and Research Prof. Dr. Mustafa Paç and the sick relatives in the hospital garden also supported the action.
Citing the incident, Paç said:
Unfortunately, violence is increasing for health workers.
We've had an example of this incident yesterday (before) in the evening, when our cardiac vascular surgeon was beaten by a patient.
In order for these events to end quickly, we demand that our people's sensitivity on this issue increase, even though we take every precaution we can as our state, our ministry, and our governorship.
I condemn yesterday's events on behalf of my hospital and medical staff.
"Unfortunately, what we experienced at this time has become a professional complication," he noted, noting that the public should be conscious of violence in health.
He said, "We'll take our own precautions, but most importantly, our nation is taking care of its own healthcare worker."
"Our laws on violence in health have been effective enough," Turkmen said.
That's what the government's ranks are doing.
The police are working on it right now.
In the past, it's always been empty, but right now, it's a civil suit, and the government's assigning lawyers, following the case.
He used the phrase, "There's some heavy punishment samples involved in this too."
After the announcements, the employees continued their work.
Supposedly, the incident took place around 5:45 p.m. the day before yesterday.
The relatives of the patient who died in ICU attacked Dr. Hamdi Mehmet Uzbek, who worked in the O.R. who reported his death.
When Uzbek was removed from the scene by doctors and assistants, police were called to the hospital.
While Uzbek's nose was broken, the attackers were taken into custody.
One of the witnesses said:
When our friend went to his relatives to inform them of the condition of a patient who had lost his life, the patient attacked our friend and two of our friends, who were responsible for the situation.
Our friend's nose is broken, he's covered in blood.
Then we took our friend into the O.R. and hid him.
For 15 to 20 minutes, security pulled a set between us.
If the patient's relatives had breached that firewall, something much worse would have happened.
A heavy blow to the DEA at Gaziantep: 102 sacks...
According to the information issued by Gaziantep Public Prosecutor's Office, the Gaziantep Security Directorate's Anti-Terror Branch has seized 5,100kg of ammonium nitrate in an operation to build explosives in a warehouse in Kayaönü neighborhood, which has been identified as belonging to the terrorist organisation DEAŞ, under investigation by Gaziantep Public Prosecutor's Office.
In the operation in which six people were taken into custody, 35 magazine clips, 2,370 loaded cartridges, 3 pistols, 7 clips and 382 loaded cartridges belonging to this pistol, 2 shotguns and 1 pala, 39,705 euros and 15,870) USD were seized for a total of £163,000 dollars, and a large number of digital items.
The search also found four books, which were issued by the broadcast organs of the (PDY) terrorist organisation, with a decision to collect them.
Six people detained were transferred to the judicial authorities following their interrogations.
Suspects have been arrested by the Criminal Judgeship of Peace on duty for which they have been dispatched.
Ravage of YPGs in Syria...
The U.S. interfered
According to the AA local sources, the YPG terrorists looted the homes of residents of Tel Semin County in the northern rural part of Rakka, where the US supports its terrorist organisation, on the basis of the fight against DEAS.
The response of civilians whose homes have been looted and confiscated has turned into a conflict with the terrorist organization.
As a result, US forces in the region entered the area in armored vehicles.
The "Cougar MRAP" type of armoured, personnel carriers and Husky-type mine detection tools have been found to be a buffer zone in the area.
The terrorist organisation YPG does not allow civilians fleeing death in Rakka, under fire as part of the anti-DEAS operation, to enter cities under its control.
The local activist network, "Rakka is being murdered quietly," announced yesterday only in July that 121 civilians were killed in the organization's artillery fire.
Let's not move the fights of the old world to tomorrow.
The delayed perception of domestic and world reality can lead to crises, not just people.
One of the reasons for the backward East's delayed perception of the world's realities, as we call it, is that the reflection of these facts into the geography of the East may be blocked by certain focal points or announced in a realistic way.
Don Quixote and Oblomov also became the subject of the literary world, whether to perceive the facts and change by delay or not at all.
Cervantes's "Don Quixote" is a lunatic who still thinks he's a knight in the cycle when the bourgeois began to form.
Or Gonçarov's "Oblomov" is a lazy legacy who thinks that when he ignores the facts, everything can go back to the way it used to be.
China, for example, is a country that is open to the world and dominates the seas until the end of the 15th century, and is closed to the throne by a conservative dynasty.
This has lasted until the execution of captains of boats out of China's black waters.
We Turks, with one foot, eye and ear in the West, the other foot, eye and ear in the East, had constant dilemmas about understanding the facts and changes starting with the Ottomans.
One of our old and new episodes tried to move yesterday to today, to understand today with the concepts that fit the old conditions, to think of yesterday as tomorrow.
One part of us has been able to act as quickly as the focus of thinking in developed countries on understanding both the reality of the home and the world and the change.
It's caused constant conflicts, tensions.
The university with Medrese, the modern army with its innovation, their doubts with faith, led to dramatic dualism.
Progress and even worse, new and advanced postures at one time were not accepted at the end of certain times and will remain behind.
After a period of time, yesterday's advanceers declared the new and advanced one "Dangerous," and those who tried to interpret the conditions of the home and the world in line with the current truth began to declare it "Traitor."
The most important lesson is that in the Ottomans, those who sense the home and the world's realities delayed and dominated the life of thought and state, the empire eventually fell apart, and the people became poor.
The most important lesson our Ottoman past passed to the Republic was the fact that the quick perception of the world's conjunctive and change was an inevitable prerequisite for survival.
Since this lesson was well absorbed, we have been the model country of this geography from World War I to this day, which has managed to preserve its unity, integrity, stability in peace.
A different approach is that in order for us to survive the process of global change, we need to put the memorization behind us and act in harmony with the facts.
In other words, it's no good for anyone to be able to carry meaningless camps and feuds that have caused our democracy to limp in the past.
Moreover, in today's world, the smallest mistakes lead to major and dramatic crises.
The most problematic geography is the Middle East, where we are.
Ancient artifact operation in Mush
In a statement issued by the governorship, it has been said that an operation has been carried out by members of the province's Gendarme Command unit on the smuggling of historical artifacts.
"As a result of studies, two gold coins, one silver coin, 20 bronze coins, one bronze bracelets, two bronze rings, one shattered glass bracelet, four stone objects, eight necklaces, one pink-white stone object, one picture frame, 23 different diameters, 23 different objects in different colors and different colors, four sharp metal objects, the covers and pages that are considered to be from six years old, and the pages that are worn out and some pages are torn out in Arabic, are considered to be a different form of the Quran -- eight books, one pink-white stone objects, one of which are considered to be broken in a different size --and-a --and-a --a --and-a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a --a -

Turkish wind
The global giants who trusted Turkey's future fought against the breaker in the tender for yesterday's wind plant.
The world record of the tender was broken in a model created by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources to reduce dependency on national energy.
With a bid to lower Turkey's energy costs, $1 billion investment and nearly 4,000 employment have also been opened.
Local production wind turbines will be included in the system by the beginning of 2019.
Eight consortiums -- including US, Chinese, German and Danish giants -- participated in the tender for a wind plant license opened by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (YEKA).
The tender opened financial bid envelopes to identify the five bidders who first offered the lowest bid.
After the first bid envelopes, the lowest bid was $4.19/kilovathour.
Open reduction interval is.01 cents.
After the tender began, Enercon decided not to participate in the open reduction of joint venture groups, including Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas.
The open reduction included Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang.
After the withdrawal of the consortium with Nordex, MingYang-First Construction and Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon remained in the final two.
MingYang-First Construction took 11 breaks.
Siemens-Türkers-The Kalion Energy Consortium never used a break.
Energy and resources Minister Berat Colonel: Record day for Turkey.
Open reduction continued 30 laps.
The winner of the intense conflict between the two consortiums was the Siemens-Türkers-Kalyon joint venture group, which bid the lowest with $3.48 cents/ kilowatts.
The consortium bidd $3.49 cent/kilovathours in the tender, while Deputy Undersecretary Alparslan withdrew his bid at 3.48 p.m. at the request of the tender commission headed by Bayraktar.
Turkey has won a world record with the two-hour YEKA tender.
$3.48 per kilowatt hour offered in the tender went down in history as the world's lowest figure in this area.
The previous record was held by Mexico with $3.84 per kilowatt hour.
After the end of the tender, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Colonelrak, who held a press conference, said the victory of the German company Siemens was an important message to the region and the world. "I also think that this results in Turkey and Germany's 200-year historical co-operation will contribute significantly to Turkey-German relations."
We've got big targets.
Today's conclusion revealed how solid and confident the economic and energy market is moving forward in the future.
No matter how many regional crises there are in the world, I am very proud to demonstrate that Turkey is the head of the region and the most reliable investment countries in the world.
"All of Turkey, in this picture, which we will be proud of as 80 million, is our President's biggest contribution, within 15 years of power and leadership, which brings Turkey to this point," he said.
"One of the most important steps was, until yesterday, the cost of buying $10.3/cent per kilowatts per kilowatts, with an historic record of $3.48/cent, at a price of a world record," he said.
I'm proud of this, on behalf of my people, on behalf of my country.
"We will include our domestic production wind turbines in the system by the beginning of 2019," he said, adding that they aim to activate the first domestic production panels in solar energy by the end of 2018.
The turbines will be set up in five designated areas.
The winning company will employ a total of 1,000 megawatts of power in each of these five regions, under the condition of building at least 50 megawatts of wind power.
The total investment of the Siemens-Türkers-Talion group will be over $1 billion.
With domestic wind plants entering the business, the electricity will produce a minimum of 3 billion kilowatts per year, and nearly 1.1 million households will need electricity from the wind.
Averaging 1.5 million tons of CO2/year emissions will also be provided through wind installations.
The winning company will build a factory with over $100 million in investments.
The factory will produce 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines, at least 2.3 megawatts.
Consortium, wing, generator design, material technologies and production techniques, at least three out of software and innovative gearbox areas will do R&amp;amp;amp; R&amp;gt; R&amp;gt; R&amp;gt; for at least five years.
The R&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;I&amp;amp;amp;amp;I&amp;amp;I&amp;amp;I&amp;amp;I&amp;amp;I&amp;I&amp;amp;I&amp;amp;I&amp;I&amp;I&amp;I&amp;I&amp;The budget for R&amp;I&amp;I&amp;I&amp;I&amp;The budget for R&amp;I&amp;I&amp;I&amp;S will be split by $5m;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;i;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;am;m;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;m:
The factory will be established 21 months after the contract is signed.
The project's license is 30 years.
"We plan to provide financing of the equipment from foreign sources and the rest of the equipment from local banks," said Turkishers Construction's Executive Board Chairman Kazim Türker, who won the tender, saying the project would be around 64 per cent of domestic production.
The tender reflects confidence in the Turkish economy, he said.
"There has been a tender that will reduce Turkey's external dependency by a thousand megawatts," said Kalyon Holding Energy Group President Murtaza Ata.
"We're happy with the result," he said.
"We will do our best to reduce the cost of electricity," Slemens Gamesa Turkey's Senior Manager Hakan Yıldırım said, saying they have been operating in Turkey for 160 years.
The locality rate of wind turbines to be produced in the factory will be at least 65 percent.
65% of the 8,000 industrial parts found in the wind turbine will be domestic (at least 5,200 parts).
Each of the five districts will have at least 50 MW facilities, a total of 1,000 MWs.
3.750 jobs, 10 years R&amp;amp; R&amp;amp;$5 million each year for R&amp;amp;amp;D's R&amp;amp;amp;D
The 1,000MW Wind Facility produces 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines of at least 2.3 MWe.
Over $1 billion investment is an investment of over $100 million a year in the production capacity of 400 MW/year wind turbines.
Electric production of about 1.1 million homes is an average 1.5 million tons of CO2/year emissions reduction in the production of minimum 3 billion kWh electrical energy per year.
Moore's Ford massacre: Activists Resuscitate Racist Link for Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury, Monroe, was passed through a group of spectators in rural Georgia, and made its way to Moore's little Ford Bridge.
A car with four black passengers and a white driver stepped forward to block the path of a group of armed white men before reaching the bridge.
The leader of the gang, a middle-aged man in a thin striped suit, took a long breath from his cigar and looked through the windshield carefully.
Inside, the people who sat were startled by fear.
"We want that fucking thing, Roger!" he barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
As a young black man was dragged out of the front passenger seat, the screams pierced the darkness.
Fortunately, this terrifying scene on June 22nd is just a re-enactment.
But when a noose was thrown around Roger's neck, almost everyone in the audience breathed quite realisticly.
Since 2005, human rights advocates have been returning to the Ford Bridge in Moore to revive the lynching of two black couples (Roger and Dorothy Malcom and Mae Murray Dorsey) in 1946 by the Ku Klux Klan.
So far, no one has been charged with the murders.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the reenactment, said: "Even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are, it doesn't make sense that all these years one person hasn't been arrested."
"It's a stain in history, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks was a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and a lifelong civil rights advocate.
For him, it is a re-enactment, a call for dramatic action, and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that no injustice has ever been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want results, we want wounds to heal, we want compromise, but first we have to get justice," he said.
"We can't have wounds wrapped up and compromised until we get justice."
On July 27, 1946, the coroner put a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Ford lint in Moore.
According to the FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding areas were suspected of lynching.
But not one of them was ever investigated.
Although suspects remain fugitives for decades, human rights advocates say that lynchings' twin motivations are always well known throughout the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a supreme court ruling made it possible for black citizens in Georgia to vote in the primary at the end of that summer.
According to the FBI, at about the same time as the election, black partner Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, apparently in a fight with a woman.
Brooks explained that the rumor in town was that Hester slept with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not from her own husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a leading white landowner, paid $600 to get Malcom out of prison.
Dorothy and her cousins, Mae Murray, and George Dorsey, went to prison as escorts.
But as they drove away from the prison, when they came to the Ford Bridge on Moore, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
An FBI report concludes, "It appears Harrison was the one who arranged the murders and ordered the order."
"There was obviously a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement, which not only involved in the murder, but destroyed evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks told me a lot shorter and shorter.
He said, "This was a voting rights massacre."
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'That's what happens to you if you register and vote.'"
For almost ten years, Cassandra Greene has been directing the re-enactment of Ford Bridge lynchings at Moore's every year.
His performance reveals all the details, it's remarkable, and it's based on a deep kind of racism that many believe is no longer in America.
It's hard to watch, and it's even harder to turn your eyes, but Greene says that's the point.
He said, "We don't want to talk about the crane because it's confronting all of us with the ugliness inside of us."
"But if you're not listening to me or listening to what's happening to me, I can't develop a relationship with you."
The rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, about 30 actors (a dozen whites and the rest of them blacks) filled a room, and when Greene willingly entered the well-rehearsed general lines of the game, they listened.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's assistant director.
He played the role of President Klansman over the years, but he says the role never got any easier.
Marbaugh said, "I feel dirty because it's not me."
"But I think it's important to keep this past alive because we don't want to go back to that time."
Actors who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester throughout the room rehearsed their lines by Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona.
The game starts when Malcom yells at Hester, where he's so angry that he's sleeping with his wife Dorothy.
"Z...i, get off my property!"
Rascona's responding.
There's a shot.
And then everyone (at least black actors) is laughing.
Greene laughs the most.
Rascona said, "What?"
He was agitated, surprised.
Was I too hard?
Greene giggled and said, "No."
"I just don't think white people used to say shit back then."
One of the black players said "yes" and threw a joke with a rock.
"You must suppress 'R'."
So the energy in the room is changing and some kind of intimacy is replacing the unrest.
Everyone's dedicated to doing it right, not just for the sake of the game, but for the memory of the four people who were killed.
The stage is starting again.
This time he's saying the word that starts with Rascona N, sharp and emphasizing.
Absolutely no one's laughing.
The reanimation ends violently and quickly.
There's screaming, gunshots, and then there's silence.
A woman dressed in funeral black stands on the bodies of actors and reads Billie Holiday's sad eulogy, "The Weird Meyva."
One of the two words breaks her voice.
About a hundred yards back, an average of four dozen spectators wipe out sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost equally divided, black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, a lot of them up the road.
While Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the Malcoms and Dorseys' graves, they all endured almost eight hours of Georgia's oppressive humidity.
Up until this point, the murders were an anecdote, but standing in the same place where the heat is now means the air seems cursed.
While the final notes of the song fail, Greene invites the crowd to zoom in and examine the bodies.
The children crouch on their hands, gripping false blood and motionless bodies and whispering to each other.
A little boy murmurs, "They're not really dead," as if they remind him.
In a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd, and it's over.
Actors throw the lynching rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh in a suit that plays President Klansman.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his actor friends, and tears come out of their eyes, and the emotional cost of performance comes to him at the very end.
A woman whispers, "It's okay."
"We know this is not what is in your heart.
You did it for a reason."
Then the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At a table, the white couple from Atlanta are having a heated conversation with a black couple about revitalization.
Denise Duplinski has trouble finding words about how performance makes her feel.
He said, "They come out of people like you and they do it because they're like you."
"What this does to me is it makes me think that lynchings are still going on," he added. "They are now only called police armed attacks."
At the end of the room, Tyrone Brooks is the center of attention when he eats at his desk and talks about human rights.
He said he's already planning next year's performance.
" Re-enactment is kind of inspiring because it describes what we're going through, but it's also instructive," he said.
"It's like if you don't learn from it, it might happen again.
Those who do not seek their pasts and those who do not know their pasts are bound to repeat it."
Accident in Mugla: 4 dead; 6 wounded
According to information, the 48 YS 411 car registered under Adam Secret, collided with the 09 B 1510 car in Sinan Kiroğlan's administration, at the Kavlıdere-Yatığan Road Salkım position.
Several medical and rescue teams were dispatched to the scene on a call to the 112 Emergency Call Center.
==Early life==Duraniye Kıröğlan and Derya Kiroğlan, who were found pregnant for eight months, were killed at the scene of the crime, while Mertcan Kökoğlan lost his life at the State Hospital where he was removed.
The injured Sinan, Senem, Furkan Kıroglan, Adam, Yilmaz, and Abdullah Sütlı Muğla Sıtkı Koçman were removed from the Hospital of Education and Research.
It's been learned that the life-threatening threat to the wounded continues.
Due to the accident, the road to the Yaten-Cowland has been closed for some time.
Kavakıdere Mayor Mehmet Demir and Kethan Gendarme Commander Captain Engin January also arrived at the scene and received information about the accident.
From the EC Party to the congressional website
By the AK Party, 6.
The usual congressional process has been set up on a web site called "accongrees.com."
The website included brochures, materials, and visuals that the party's organization will use in the process.
In the website's 'communication strategy', the rules for the congressional process are listed in 14 topics.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose message was included on his website, warned members to comply with the party's institutional identity during the congressional process.
"Now we begin a new era of breakthrough," Erdogan said in his message.
In order to achieve their 2023 targets with a stronger pace, we need to be renewed and renewed.
"We must continue to work hand-in-hand, shoulder-to-shoulder tomorrow as we did yesterday."
Pearson made another 3,000 layoffs to re-enact the operation, cut the profits.
While the British training group Pearson began another restructuring programme to overcome the pressures facing the business, he said he would lay off 3,000 more jobs on Friday and reduce his share of the profits by 72 per cent.
According to chief executive John Fallon, layoffs, mostly at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, will be added to 4,000 positions lost in previous reconstruction.
In May, Pearson announced a plan that would save 300 million pounds (394 million U.S.) by trying to resuscitate the work that quickly slipped into digital learning with a third cost reduction programme.
The company, which agreed to sell its share at Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said there was no change in this year's perspective after reporting its basic sales at £2.05 billion, up 1 per cent in the first half.
Metin 2 took him to his death again!
According to the first coroner's report, Hakan's death was suicide, according to the preliminary autopsy report.
In the detailed examination, no signs of battery or algebra were found in the child's body.
The reason for the suicide is that the elastic bandage around his neck is the result of asphyxiation.
It was also identified as an elastic bandage used in the injuries that her parents described as a bandage.
According to the report of Müslim Sarıyar from Haberturk, the report stating that the incident was suicide will be sent to the Grand Czechmece Public Prosecutor's Office, who conducted the investigation.
While the police investigate the child's suicide with all the details, the investigation of his computer, which was confiscated after the incident, continues.
It has been said that the police will also apply for the testimony of Hakan's friends.
It is also stated that information from Hakan's computer, which his relatives call "cleaned," can be obtained by third parties or a gang.
Police are considering that Hakan may have been driven by a gang of suicides.
The certainty that Hakan committed suicide turned the eyes to violent Metin2.
Responding to addiction and violence among children, Metin2, which was banned by Antalya Governorate last year from under 15 years of age, also came to the attention of 13-year-old Metin Kang.
To play Metin2, designed in Korea in 2005, you have to go to her website and register a member.
The players are trying to bring peace and justice to the world with the dragon god in the game.
Wars happen while he's doing that, and his violence is increasing.
The game includes images of war with lines, swords, machetes, axes, cutting, piercing weapons, as well as images of people being eaten by wild animals.
The player buys characters with money to get stronger.
The family who buried their children the next day continued to claim murder after the incident in the house in Esenyurt İsiklal neighborhood of Koknar Street.
"All his dream was to be a doctor, we don't think he could hurt himself or anyone else because of the play," he said. "They wrapped the elastic bandage around his neck and tied the knot on the side."
That's how he was found, son.
We certainly don't think that our son could hurt himself or anyone else or commit suicide because of an online game.
We knew he was playing a game like this.
It wasn't a game he played.
Let's say he quits when he's a little bored.
Mother Gulizar Ekinci said, "There is no way in or out of the building."
It's said that my child entered the house at a certain hour.
They're all inconsistencies.
When his brother came home, there was only one chair.
"But when his funeral was found, there were two chairs next to the computer."
İlker KARAŞ: He may have been involved with the gang
Families generally don't pay attention to it.
They're like, "You know, just so my kid's home, you know, whatever's going on."
The child communicates with many people through games.
There may have been a loan situation or a swearing situation.
Or he invited someone in the game to come over, and they might have had a problem.
He may have had an impact on his problems with other people he was communicating with, not directly from the game.
The kid may have thought the visualization, the fiction of the game was real.
The trauma leading to suicide could be about blackmail.
If the child is faced with complaining to the family, he is also suffering from depression because he cannot solve the problem.
He couldn't have committed suicide because of the game itself.
There's a chance the kid's involved with the gang.
He could be involved with the gang.
There's nothing a child could have done on her own as an individual.
Information systems adviser Füsun NEBIL: Families need to know the interaction of their children
We can't say the games are harmful.
Studies also say that games are useful for children's development.
What's important here is that parents pay attention to what their children play and how they talk to actors online.
Parents need to know how children are affected by what content, and take precautions.
In Turkey, there are only two children in five years who are said to have died from the game.
Which means that taking a child's life isn't just a game effect.
I wonder what drove this boy to it.
We need to find out first.
You need to look at sociology and psychology around the kid.
The stock market has reached 50 per cent of the eight-month return in Istanbul
The BIST 100 index continued its rise trend in July, which began in December 2016, and moved its rise to the eighth moon at the top.
Thus, the index was the first time since July 2007 to record an increase of 8 months in a row, while at this time it gained 45.3%.
With its performance since the beginning of the year, the BIST 100 index, which left behind the major markets of the world, including Germany, the United States, Britain, Japan, gave up the lead in July.
The Dow Jones index in the United States followed the FTSE 100 index in Britain at 0.81 per cent, with a 2.4 per cent increase in the BIST 100 index, which completed 7.06 per cent in July.
In Almaya, the DEX index and the Nikkei index in Japan completed July with a loss of value.
As of January-July, the BIST 100 index showed a high performance of both the major world markets and the emerging stock markets.
The BIST 100 index, which won 37.6 per cent in 2016 this year, followed the Dow Jones index with an increase of 10.76 per cent, the Dow Jones index with 5.55 per cent, the DAX index with an increase of 4.55 per cent, and the Nikkei index with an increase of 3.21 per cent, and the FTSE 100 index with an increase of 3.21 per cent.
The MSCI EM index, a indicator of the developing country's stock markets, yielded 23%.
Based on the historical process of the BIST 100 index, it has shown similar performances in the past.
The BIST 100 index, which finished eight months in a row between December 2006 and July 2007, had increased by 38.3 per cent during this period.
The BIST 100 index completed 8 months between August 1996 and March 1997 in nine consecutive months between May 1997 and January 1998.
Meksa Investment Research Director Eren Can Ömüt told AA correspondent that the BIST 100 index has continued to rise for eight months, saying it has exceeded 37 per cent of the rise since the beginning of the year.
The CECI markets (EM) index has increased by 23 per cent, saying that even looking at these rates, there is a positive dissolution, he noted.
Fund flow to developing countries has been going on since the beginning of the year.
Funds, particularly in search of high returns, prefer countries that pay higher interest.
In this case, domestic markets are affected in a positive way.
Of course, the appetite for risk on a global scale is very high.
This allows stock indexes in risky asset status to be sought out.
In the United States, the S&P 500 index has been tested for new record levels almost every week, in line with an increase of nearly 11 per cent since New Year's.
Stressing at the beginning of the year that the US Central Care (Fed) 3 interest increase is stressing forecasting markets, but Fed has used his oral guidance policy very well to eliminate uncertainty, the Umüt said, adding that there is an insensitive market for Fed's interest increase.
He said inflation in the United States is not yet at the desired level, and the expectations that the Fed will not be hasty about the interest increase and avoid radical moves are very effective in current pricing.
"The faster-growing US economy, thanks to Trump, has affected stock markets for a period of positive effect, but the lack of commitments strengthens the hands of Fed in terms of faster growth and faster inflation," he said, saying US President Donald Trump's failure to cancel the health reform known as "Obamacare."
Emüt noted that 2016 was a year of many negatives in terms of Turkey's markets, while trying to cover the difference according to similar BIST 100 index, which split negatively and was overselling.
Noting that they did not see a strong recovery through domestic news flow, Umüt said the current appearance could be interpreted as a triggering desire to cover the difference according to similar domestic markets, with an increased risk-taking appetite abroad.
Ümüt said he saw a number of profit sales in the BIST 100 index, which technically tested new records with 108,600 levels:
In particular, 109,500,110,000 areas are a critical threshold in the short term.
After approaching these levels, it's normal for profit sales to take place.
In the short term, we think there should be a local or global new story for over 110,000 pricings.
For now, a subroutine of 107,500 support could trigger profit sales.
In this case, even if we follow the 107,000 intermediaries, I think it's possible to relax to 106,000-105.500 areas.
In particular, the breaking of 105,500 support can lead to a retreat to 104,300 levels, which is 50 percent of Fibo's rise from 100,000 to 108,600 levels.
Both the Fed and the European Central Bank's (ECB) decisions will be at the focal point of the global market, UNÜmüt said the expectations for Fed are already clear, but the possibility of increasing interest in September FOMC may trigger strengthening the US dollar.
"In addition, what is important is what the ECB will say."
After the July monetary policy board meeting, ECB President Mario Draghi voiced that they would discuss the course of monetary policy in the fall, and it allowed the euro/dolar parity to rise above 1,1700 levels.
Hence, statements on whether or not a 60 billion-euro-month asset will be reduced or terminated will also mean that after-Fed liquidity will be reduced by ECB on a global scale.
"There may be negative pricing on behalf of the country's markets, such as Turkey, which has a high current deficit and has a mandatory access to foreign funds," he said.
Delegated Investment Investment Advisory Director Erol Gürcan said there was a very serious rally for global stock markets following Trump's election in the United States in November 2016.
Gürcan said it is possible to say that the main trigger for this rally movement is global growth prospects -- particularly Trump's promises for tax reductions -- has increased expectations of global growth, he said.
The stock market was the head of the major markets at the global rally in Istanbul.
One of the most important reasons for this is that the BIST 100 index has been quite discounted in recent years compared to the developing country markets, but it is also important to say that the steps taken by policymakers to support the economy and financial markets have played a serious role.
In particular, we can say that the Credit Guarantee Fund (KGF), which has been activated as of March, has a serious impact on the rise so far.
For the rest of the year, Georgian said positive developments were reflected in considerable pricing and that the KGF, which had a significant role in this rise, was slowly satisfied, and the BIST 100 index still remains discounted compared to similar country markets, but said that the search for a new story could gradually come to the for the rest of the year.
Such developments, such as the 180-day action plan, which has been expected to be shared in detail for some time, such as the increase of the Credit Guarantee Fund's limit, are likely to contribute positively in this sense, such as the company's profits, a possible tax reduction that has recently been on the agenda, Gürcan said.
The fact that major developed country central banks, such as Gürcan, Fed, ECB and the UK Central Bank (BoE), are likely to gradually tighten their existing enlargement monetary policy stances, stressing that it is among the critical risk factors for developing countries again, adding that "The Fed, which has been continuing to increase metric interest rates for some time, will likely start the process of downsizing the balance sheet after September, and that the ECB is likely to end its development programme in the near period, and that BOE should be among the most important developed country's central banks that should be followed by increasing interest rates."
In the possible corrections in the index in the coming period, Gürcan said that the 104,150-104,600 support area, which corresponds to a 200-hour average of rising trend since the beginning of the year, is critical, and that the corrective movement can continue to the 101,700, 100,000, 99,200 levels, respectively, in case this support area is broken.
If the current trend of ascension is maintained and the current historic peak level of 108,605 resistance is broken, the index can rise to 110,000-112,000 ranges, Gürcan said.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
Officials say that in Kabul, Afghanistan, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy, killed a NATO soldier and injured several.
NATO said five soldiers and one interpreter were injured.
Unconfirmed local sources say three civilians were killed in the incident in the city's Karabakh region.
The bombing took place in Afghanistan this month; more than 30 people died in a mosque explosion in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said Thursday's explosion launched an attack on the joint patrol with the Afghan army's 'personal-guided hand-made explosive'.
The statement said all wounded were in good condition and were being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram air base.
Reporters say the Taliban has increased power and that the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabağ is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, Afghanistan witnessed at least 1662 civilians' deaths in the first half of 2017, with 20% on average in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul's mostly Shiite region.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack.
On May 31st, after U.S.-led forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001, the most deadly militant attack in the country killed more than 150 people in a massive bombing at the center of the city.
The act of violence highlights US President Donald Trump's unstable security situation in Afghanistan as he puts his weight on whether or not to increase the number of US troops helping the country's military and police.
Reporters say suicide bombings in Kabul have led to a crisis in the government, its policies, and especially in the public confidence of President Ashraf Ghani in recent weeks.
EPA stopped delaying the dirty air rule after the trials
The U.S. Environmental Protection Organization returned a day later, when 15 states sued the organisation on this initiative, after a decision to delay the law demanding that states prevent pollution -- a Obama era law -- to prevent emissions that cause bad smoke.
The EPA said it showed the organisation's determination to work with the states late Wednesday, announcing its decision to continue with "2015 Ozon Decisions."
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and being sensitive to them," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA's intention to delay its ozone decisions a year by October 2018, with these decisions measuring current pollution in various parts of the country and deciding where to cut down to meet more difficult air quality standards.
The 15 states, mostly Democrats and the Columbia District, filed a lawsuit Tuesday saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration continues its search to regain the wide range of environmental regulations that were implemented by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda Trump calls for to revive economic growth.
However, these efforts have led to the reaction of Democrats and protective groups who are concerned about the impact of more emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that air breathing containing ozone "can reduce lung functions and increase respiratory symptoms, such as asthma."

All hands on stoper and wing transfer!
Beşiktaş President Fikret Orman has made statements to Bein Sports about the transfer of Dutch footballer Jeremain Lens and stoper.
Fikret Forest said...
There's no surprise at the transfer.
Our goal isn't to transfer too much, it's a point shot.
Now we're going to do a stoper and a wing transfer.
We've got Champions League games, I hope we get a good draw.
We have to transfer wings.
10 million euros is easy, but we don't have that kind of budget.
If it comes to what we call budgets, we'll transfer it, and if we don't, we won't die.
I won't be able to give you any information on the lenses until I'm clear.
We're a public company.
Patience is a means to an end.
The ISID threat is only for August 30th. Isn't there one for the festival?
Reactions continue with Ankara Governor's ban on sit-ins, memorial meetings and all other public activities, including concerts throughout August, on the grounds of "the threat of ISIS."
The government's ban decree states "all collective activities" in Ankara, while 7th.
The International Grand Ankara Festival continues.
CHP Group Deputy Chair and Ankara MP Levent Gök told the SÖZCÜ that "August 30 is not even affected by the bans," and said:
He's got some serious confusion.
Even the governor's office is hesitant as to what decision he's going to make...
The government's job is to create areas where the holidays will be celebrated.
CHP Ankara MP Murat Emir said "All Ankara has a security issue, only Gökçek's organizations have no security problems."
Ankara Independent MP Aylin Nazlıaka moved the ban to parliament.
"Doesn't this ban make clear the AKP's hatred of the republic and Ataturk clear? How do you intend to block millions that will celebrate August 30th in the fields?" Nazlıaka said, demanding the prime minister's response.
"I learned from Edwina myself that I was deceived."
Demet Sener, who continued his divorce with Ibrahim Kutluay, was at the Pointstone with his lawyer Aslı Hatemi the other day.
She filed a lawsuit against Edwina Sponza, who claims to have destroyed her home, and presented the photos of Sponza and Kutluay together as evidence to the court.
The sophisticated beauty Sponza also filed a criminal complaint against Sener, saying, "Demet has seized my private photographs illegally."
'I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EAT.'
After the latest development, Sener met with his lawyer in Nişistite Delicatessen, when he saw the journalists, he left the premises.
Sener, who was very cheerful, laughed when he was reminded of Edwina Sponza's claim about the photos, saying, "God forbid, I must have entered her house."
As a matter of fact, Hatemi also complained about Sponza's complaint, "There is a complaint like this, but its contents are not true."
"We've got everything; we've presented it to the court," he said.
"In recent years, everyone knew about your husband's relationship with Sponza."
"How come you didn't know?"
What?
How?
"I swear I didn't know," said Sener, "would I believe my husband who looked me in the eye or the gossip of the world?"
"Did you not hear anything?" said Sener, first of all, after journalists insisted on asking him, "No." "I didn't hear it, of course I heard it the first time."
But I didn't believe in it at all.
Everything was normal, in its place; I had nothing to suspect.
Ma'am, when I got everything in my hand, I found out all about it, so...
"Was Sponza the one who sent the evidence?" he answered, "Yes" and confused them by claiming that Sponza himself sent him the photos and correspondence he presented to the court.
Sponza had previously claimed that his correspondence with Ibrahim Kutluay was a montage.
Beşiktaş will sign a contract with Negredo tomorrow.
The Besiktas Club will officially include Spanish footballer Alvaro Negredo tomorrow.
The signing ceremony will be held at Vodafone Park for Negredo, where Beşiktaş agreed in principle on Spain's transfer to the Valencia Club.
The signing ceremony, which will be attended by club president Fikret Forest, will be held at 12:00.
By the way, the Spanish football player will also be checked out tomorrow morning.
Qatar: We broke the embargo in hours thanks to Turkey
Qatar Economy and Trade Minister Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani said they would like to express their gratitude to the people of Turkey.
Al Thani: "Thank you so much for your gracious attitude and your support."
I give my brother President Recep Tayyip Erdogan the salutations of the Qatar Emir.
The Qatar economy has proven its resistance.
In many countries, economies are negatively affected, while our economy stands firm.
For Qatar to be independent and strong, we must work with all our might.
We've broken the embargo against us largely in hours, thanks to Turkey.
There's nothing missing from us right now.
Our natural resources support Qatar's economy with natural gas exports.
We were not affected by Turkey's brutal blockade against us and against the law.
Today Qatar continues its worldwide production of gas and LNG.
"We've had a 30 percent increase in gas exports, not a decline in natural gas exports after what happened," he said.
"In the first quarter, a volume of $554m has been created," Al Thani said, adding that work has continued in all areas between Qatar and Turkey.
In this, the recent decisions have played a significant role.
In all sectors, it is very important for us to accelerate the access of goods from Turkey, to invest in many areas, as a result of its proof of itself in the Qatar market.
"I thank you very much for your constructive attitude towards us," he said.
The cost of recent disasters is $300 million.
TSB President Can Akın Çağlar said that after the flood on July 18th, the insurance companies reported 7,000 damage costs of 116m euros, 800 reported damages of $12m in the Gökova earthquake on July 21st, and on July 27th there were 22,000 reports of damage to the insurance, adding that the last three incidents cost the insurance.
"The damage caused by the lad in terms of the kasko insurance is about $3,500 per car, and the glass damage is around a thousand lira."
"In the depression, the average housing damage is 6,000 liras," he said.
"The risk of natural disaster is increasing because of the change in climate," he said, stressing that three out of four people do not have housing insurance, one out of two businesses does not have fire insurance, and two out of three do not have insurance insurance.
Due to the low-insurance rate in our country, the risk of our citizens and institutions facing serious damage costs is growing every day.
All these costs should not be left above the state.
Insurance policies are not as expensive as they think, insurance is not only a sector that pays damage; they also provide risk management advice.
It's very important for our people and our country to increase insurance and insurance.
"In the general conditions of the kasko insurance policy, the insurance people must report their damage within five work days, and that time ended yesterday," he said.
"Is he going to be an insurance victim?" answered the question: "In general, though such a period of time, the statute of limitations on the Trade Law is two years."
He said, "It's also a natural disaster, so the insurance people don't have to panic, no company says they don't pay."
That's how the German media saw the huge contract!
The German Siemens company won Turkey's first tender for Renewable Energy Resources (YEKA) during a period of growing difficulties between Turkey and Germany.
German media announced the development "German Siemens won the huge tender in Turkey."
"The consortium will invest over $1 billion in wind facilities," DWelle said in a report that the Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon consortium won the YEKA tender.
"The tender for the creation of a thousand megawatt wind energy capacities is Turkey's first YEKA tender," the report quoted the number of companies competing in the tender as being dropped from 8 to 2 today, facing Chinese Mingyang and German Siemens consortiums, as the Chinese Mingyang consortium withdrew from the tender at the start of the 30th round.
After the tender, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Colonelrak made a dramatic statement on Turkey-German relations.
The tender resulted in the victory of the German company Siemens, and we can say that this picture is an important message to the region and the world.
In terms of Turkey and Germany's 200 years of historical co-operation, I think this results in a significant contribution to Turkey-German relations.
No matter how many regional crises there are in the world, I'm very proud to demonstrate that Turkey is at the head of the region and the most reliable investment countries in the world.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, interviewing for a possible match.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who will cross paths to present the most satisfying boxing match in the near future for £147, met on Thursday for the first time.
Garcia, the lightweight champion of the invincible World Boxing Council, was in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until she walked down the aisle and greeted the World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion Lomachenko.
On Saturday at Showtime, the vote was unanimous, defeating former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner, and after Garcia, both fighters were among the top five members of the list of non-weights.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN Saturday night at 7:00 p.m.
While the two posed for photographs, Lomochenko's manager Egis Klimar noted that a potential match between fighters would be "excellently large."
Garcia reminded me that I'm an old featherweight.
"I went high for Brianer for £40, but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I'd like to get down to a light grade.
It's got to go to the lightweight, so we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them this."
Lomachenko joined.
"Shit needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay and watch; setting a date with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) for the next summer and fighting Lomachenko in a 135-pound opening match this year is part of his strategy; Garcia is interested in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell for the lightweight heavyweight title at the Forum on September 23rd.
"The fight could be on pay-and-watch because all the fans want it," Garcia said, adding that whatever channel offered the best financial package was open to him.
We're the main names.
No other name can create that kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready..."
Garcia said she appreciated Lomachenko as a "great fighter" and could attend her Saturday's match.
But Lomachenko hesitated to give Garcia a lot of praise from the pouch, and he said he thought that the three heavyweight champions from Riverside looked "too slow," and, "Sorry, Mikey... you wanted the knockout."
Garcia said the focus was to show the force of the fist and then box.
They both said they felt the momentum was being created for their own encounter.
"This is a fight that needs to be fought.
Another fight doesn't create so much interest and gossip.
Garcia said, "I'm so happy to deal with this."
Lomachenko said: "I waited for the best fighters and he waited for Mikey.
It's gonna be a great fight."
Turkish restaurant from Russia to America
The White House does not intend to implement sanctions that affect the construction of Moscow's pipeline, but sanctions towards Russia can increase the cost of these lines.
And that's because the cost of debt is increasing.
He was concerned that Western investment partners would consider withdrawing from projects due to sanctions, and in response, he accelerated the construction of pipelines.
The Swiss company Allseas Group, which built the Turkish Stream line, which was planned to reach Turkey under the Black Sea, accelerated construction at Gazprom's request.
Reuters also wrote that Gazprom began construction of a second pipeline "in a hurry" parallel to Turkish Stream to export more gas to Europe.
The new results of Sweden's asylum age assessment have been announced
The latest results of the evaluation tests of refugees subject to a new method of medical age assessment in Sweden have ruled that more than 80 per cent of respondents are over 18 years old, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these tests.
Sweden's National Forensics and Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalvertet) began testing earlier this year.
The tests were designed to improve the age assessment of some refugees who claim to be underage by the Swedish Immigration Agency (Migrationsverket) after their failure to assess their right age.
So far, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to the test, and the Forensics and Medicine Office has announced the results of a total of 2481 from mid-March to July 31st 2017.
80 per cent were ruled to be 18 or more, and in 25 cases, the coroner's office ruled that the subject was "probably 18 and above."
In 432 cases, the result was that the person was probably under 18.
The tests were conducted only in cases of suspicious age.
According to Johan Goransson of Forensics and Medicine, the results are consistent with past months.
"We don't see much difference in statistics from past months, the figures are quite consistent," he told The Local.
The proportion of cases that have been ruled over 18 years old does not necessarily mean that refugees are lying about their age.
In May, the apartment announced the conclusion of the 581 tests and said there were 442 situations where "the people being examined were shown to be 18 or older."
When Svenska Dagbladet reviewed the results of the 581 cases announced, 243 reportedly turned 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method, which includes X-raying 20-year-old teeth and doing MRI scans of knee joints, and then having dentists and radiologists analyze them, is criticised in some circles.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, who evaluates the biological maturity of people who are working on whether their puberty is earlier or later.
"I have reason to think about it, and I don't think this should be the kind of measurement used.
It's very suspicious to decide this way about biological life.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend to be," he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensics and Medicine Department argued that the tests were correct: "You can usually say that the risk of a child being misjudged as an adult is small.
The biggest risk is that the person is just under 18 years old, in which case the risk is around 10 per cent."
The Star Hamidiye Mosque opens today
The Star Hamidiye Mosque, which was built by Abdulhamit in 1885 by architect Nikolaidis Jelpuylo, will open Friday's prayer following restoration studies.
Regional Manager Mürsel Sarı said the restoration work that started in June 2013 was completed and the mosque was set to open.
Yellow gave this information: "Restoration studies carried out within 2 coverage."
The first part was to repair the mosque, the main building.
The second part was the environmental arrangement.
The first part included about 16 million liras and around 11 million liras for environmental regulation.
First, the bullets of the wooden dome were opened, and after they were renovated, the outer walls, the external elements, were removed from the rust.
There's been a drainage of the resilience.
As you can see when we come into the mosque, there are some very rich decorations.
It's a piece with star motifs, and it's very rich in pencil work.
There's a mixed tone here.
"The sledgehammer marks are also being seen, considering it was done in the Ottomans and 1885s, and baroque style has become a factor in architecture."
The U.S. government has a stake in it.
"The chandelier found in the middle of the mosque is German Emperor 2."
He had partial malfunctions, refurbished and hanged.
It's a very valuable and important piece.
There are wooden cages on both sides of the mosque that are symmetrical, called salutations.
We know these were made by our great Khan Abdulhamit Khan, who built the mosque himself.
So we have information that he did these with his own hands and was installed here.
They're still standing here in the original form.
He said President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to attend the mosque's opening ceremony.
Pantic claims in Göztepe
The Ukrainian press said that a 25-year-old Serbian football player who failed to qualify in Dinoma Kiev could be rented to a yellow-red club.
Pantic, who began football with Serbia's Red Star team, played for Villarreal, Cordoba, Eibar and Alaves in Spain.
Pantic signed Dinamo Kiev at halftime last season.
The governor of West Virginia has announced that he will change his party.
The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening that he would change his party at a rally with President Trump.
"Like it or not, the Democrats have abandoned me," Governor Justice said.
"Today I'm going to tell you with many prayers and thoughts... I'm going to tell you today as the West Virginians, I can no longer help you as a Democratic Governor."
The rally was full of applause.
"So tomorrow I will change my registration to Republican," he added.
"If I was a technical director, I'd say it's time for you to start a different game."
Mr. Trump promised to make an important announcement at the West Virginia rally earlier.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Democratic candidate Justice did not support Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice, the only billionaire in the province, was elected in 2016.
Forbes says he owns coal mines in five states with the coal business he inherited from his father.
Its presence is about $1.59 billion.
Republican National Congress, meanwhile, issued a statement Thursday evening saying "The change of party by Governor Justice is another coup to the Democratic Party, which would rather work to prevent it than make our country great again."
"With only 15 governors and at least a few state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is completely unleaded and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC female spokesman Ronna McDaniel told CBS.
I'll do what's best for Turkey
Three olympics, Turkey's record holder.
He was born in Cuba, but he gave his country to Turkey, where he came for the F. Garden...
In 2013 he became a Turkish citizen and wore the national jersey...
First he became a European champion, then an Olympic third...
Now one of Turkey's most important hopes for a medal in the World Athletics Championship.
Yasmani Capello, who competed in the 400m hurdles, spoke to SABAH before the championship starting today.
When they were young, they didn't want you because they didn't like your grades in Cuba.
You hired a coach to improve yourself.
Then they called me, but this time you didn't go.
Some think you chose Turkey for money.
What are you talking about?
The last thing I remember about Cuba was leaving the national team.
And from that moment on, I've drawn a line to what I've been through, to what I've been through.
Then I came to Turkey at the invitation of the Fenerbahçe club.
And my attempt at the National Team was thanks to Fenerbahce.
They made me an offer for reinforcements.
I've turned over a new leaf with Turkey.
I had a lot of injuries when I was young, but after the opportunities I was offered in Turkey, I made some major successes in Rio and Amsterdam.
I can't wait to do my best in the World Championships of Athletics and win a different title.
You've been crying at a press conference lately.
Can you tell us why?
Every time a question is raised about Turkey's claim to me, I think of my childhood, being kicked out of the Cuban national team at the age of 23.
And, of course, in Turkey, people approach me.
When I won the gold medal at the European Championships in Amsterdam, I felt something similar when I was playing the Istrillal March.
I couldn't hold back my tears.
And I thank Turkey for the opportunity to fulfill my dreams.
I'm so happy to belong to the Turkish national team.
I'll be here until my legs run.
You said earlier that you might have a Turkish lover.
You're with a Turk now, you went to Cuba together.
You want to share what you've been through?
The greatest upside of being with a Turk is calm...
When I compare it to Cuban women, peace...
Turkish girls claim their relationship.
Your girlfriend is also your assistant coach.
You've been together all day, like, does it interfere with your diet?
He eats more sweets than I do.
(Both laughing) I don't actually have a very strict diet, but it interferes with what I eat from time to time.
My trainer Massimo Matrone often gives strict warning with my diet, but I know it's for my own good.
How are you with Turkish food? Is your boyfriend cooking for you?
Turkish women cook very well, but my boyfriend makes it better.
(Laughs) Dry beans-pilav is my first choice.
I only laughed at him.
My coach in Cuba didn't believe me.
He replaced me with other young people.
We met in Cuba after winning medals for Turkey.
He looked at my face and showed me to the young athletes next to him and said, "Look, I raised him."
I just laughed at him.
My eye is my shirt.
The glasses you wear at the races are curious...
I'm just using it for concentration.
As soon as I put on the glasses, I cut off my relationship with the world and build a wall on both sides.
I'm just focusing on the finish line, and I don't see anything else.
What comes to mind when we say Tokyo 2020?
Felix Sanchez...
He won a gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics when he was 35 years old at 400m disabled.
If he can do it, I can do it in Tokyo at 33, why not?

Coe praises the'samimi' apology he wishes for Russia's doping scandal
The boss of global athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised Russia's sincere apology for the doping scandal, but stressed that it is not the right time for the country to be accepted back into the sport.
Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championship that his country's banning from sports was right and he is determined to fight doping.
He said he apologized to all athletes who were forced to win gold and silver medals in the competition.
Despite his assessments, the IAAF Congress voted that the ban would continue after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored drugs in Russia in November 2015.
"I think there is a very sincere response today, a very sincere presentation," IAAF head Coe told reporters.
"The entire council and the entire congress were pleased... that the Russian Federation had accepted him, that he had survived the very turbulent days... and that the federation had done everything possible to ensure the reconstruction of the Federation..."
He said it was also a pleasure for Russia to accept its re-acceptance criteria.
"I think it's a very constructive day and I think it's being moved forward, but Congress supports the mission force's proposal that the rights of Russia are not the right time to be restored," Coe said.
"In the next few months, we must do everything we can to normalize this situation.
Our guiding principle has always been to want to separate clean athletes from the imperfect system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, meeting solid IAAF criteria, will be competing neutrally at the World Athletics Championships, which will start in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF task force, said Monday that Russia has yet to meet many criteria for the extradition of its rights.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council in London, he told reporters that the drug test was still inadequate and that the banned trainers still work freely.
"Tank to YPG" news from the U.S.
The US Embassy in Ankara has announced that no tanks have been given to any of the fighting parties in Syria.
Their claims that the YPG was sent hundreds of trucks loaded with tanks and guns were denied.
In a statement issued by the Embassy, it was said: "A statement about false news in the press about trucks going to Syria."
A series of unconfirmed news reports in the past few days have claimed that the United States has sent hundreds of trucks to Syria loaded with tanks and weapons to support the YPG.
These reports ignore some basic facts about the current situation in Syria.
The United States has not given tanks to any group fighting against Deash in Syria.
Most of the US's military aid, primarily light weapons and ammunition, supports the Syrian Arab Coalition (SCE) within the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG).
The Syrian Arabs, including the SAK, are fighting to clear the Departure from the region and get their homes back.
TYDTA President Ermut: Direct foreign investment above last year
TYDTA President Arda Ermut said that 55 per cent of all last year's investment came after July.
"Maybe there would have been more increase, it would have stopped," he said, adding that there was no decline in investments due to the coup attempt on July 15th.
Maybe if these conditions didn't occur, if there weren't some regional developments, we'd see a greater increase in impact.
That's why we have more hope for next year.
Hopefully, it'll be a brighter year in terms of direct investment.
Anyway, as of the first five months, we're going with an 11 percent increase in last year's first five months.
But we don't think that's enough.
"We hope there will be more," he used his statements.
"It is not that global or regional developments do not cause us any concern," he said, stressing that they are trying to diversify investors.
Ermut normally reminded that 75 per cent of direct investments came from Europe by 2010, he added.
That's down to 66 percent.
Again, Asia's share rose from 2% to 78%.
Russia's share has increased.
While we were trying to do that, the Gulf countries had problems among themselves.
Turkey has good relations with all of them, especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
But the problem between these two countries saddens us and makes it possible for investors to delay their decision a little longer.
We may be having some delays, not just in terms of investments in Turkey.
Arda Ermut reminded me last week that there had been some incidents regarding Germany, but the government, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had had a clear and decisive reaction to the situation.
When they talk to the investors of the most violent political crisis, President Erdogan's reaction was, "Look, problems are between governments, absolutely not among the people."
Secondly, these people came and invested in my country.
They're just like Turkish companies to us.
On the contrary, if they have any problems, they'll come to us, and we'll figure it out.
"We will definitely not allow them to be victims," he said, expressing that they continue to support all investors with the comfort of it.
"We can guarantee that in the coming period," he said.
You'll see that neither the German companies nor the investors from some of the countries where we have a political problem will have any problems.
On the contrary, hopefully, we will do our best to increase investments from these countries.
We think the investments from here will continue to increase.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect perceptions of the investment climate.
"But we will do our best to do our part at this point, and to ensure that our investors are not affected by the perception of the investment environment."
TYDTA President Ermut said Turkey is getting a huge interest in China after a single generation of single-way strategies, but that if problems in the Gulf are resolved, they expect the biggest investment from the Gulf.
"In relations with Germany, Ermut noted that there were companies coming, coming, coming, and following, who said, 'We have suffered because of these relations, we had investments because of this incident, we have no investors."
"Almost 10% of the projects in our portfolio right now are German companies."
So almost 10 percent of all the companies we've been interviewing all over the world are German companies.
Part of them are companies that already have investments in Turkey.
He's either going to expand his investment or he's going to make a point, and we're sitting on it as a project.
"In fact, German companies are still an important part of our daily business flow," he said.
Stressing that all state institutions should be careful during the time of the perception operations to Turkey, Ermut stressed that the issue is sensitive and could be affected by the slightest bit of bad communication.
Ermut explained that what happened in the past two or three weeks was a good lesson:
The agenda of investors and politicians is always different.
We've always seen that economic relations always make political developments kind of take a turn.
Germany will remain an important business partner and an important investor.
Because they already have a lot of investments in Turkey.
The election agenda in Germany, I'm afraid, also increases such rhetoric.
I think they'll be a little bit better once they're gone.
In Saudi Arabia, the two countries are careful not to make a negative statement.
After all, an investor invests in Turkey by targeting all environmental markets.
So not because of Saudi Arabia, but because of the uncertainty in the region, there have been some slowdowns.
But we're still interviewing these investors.
In my personal opinion, investors are holding off a decision that may be faster.
We don't have a Saudi investor who says, "I see uncertainty because of the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, I'm getting out of here."
On the contrary, we still have Saudi investors who continue to live in Turkey, who meet with us while they vacation here, who follow all their processes.
"I think we'll definitely beat him this year," Arda Ermut said, reminding him that international direct investments in Turkey (UNY) are $12.3 billion last year.
"But these regional developments, global uncertainty, will affect how far we will pass," he said.
While hoping that the impact would be greater, perhaps a little more limited, Ermut said, pointing out that an 11 per cent increase as of the first five months had been increased, pointing out that this could be protected, saying, "I believe that if nothing bad happens, then we will definitely close the end of the year better than last year."
Noting that a significant portion of the investments will continue to be real estate, Ermut informed that new investments can be seen in logistics, health, fintech, IT, petro-chemistry, food, energy and manufacturing.
"We may have an investment announcement in the sense of production soon," he stressed, stressing that they will have new investments to make in the coming months.
It's not a billion dollars, but it's a big investment.
"There may also be investments from interesting countries," he said.
Operations in 9 counties to 4 wine companies: 55 detentions
Istanbul Anti-Trafficking Bureau teams have found that the foil coating on top of the products sold by 4 wine companies has been kept long and loose, not glued to the bottle, and the TAPDK bandrolls glued to the coating have been harvested after the sale and are marketed by new wines.
Due to repeated use of the suspects' bandrolls, the state has lost $20,400,000 in taxes.
Police have launched a simultaneous operation at 55 locations between four wine companies, including Istanbul, Edirne, Tekirdağ, Bursa, Balıkesir, Manisa, Aydın, Denizli and Nevşehir.
A total of 55 people were taken into custody during the operation, while a total of 15,000 were available for sale, 52,480 used TAPDK capsol bottles, 12,890 TAPDK bands, 3 pistols and bullets, 100 cases of sexual content pills, 992 illegal cigars, 698 bottles of various types of counterfeit liquor and 100 litres of anises.
55 people taken into custody were brought to the Anti-Trafficking Bureau on Vatan Street.
Suspects are currently in custody at the police station.
The operation of their team to the factories, warehouses, and businesses was reflected on police cameras.
Police teams were seen in search of a warehouse, removing hoods found on bottles of wine ready for sale.
Bags of used bottles, full of TAPDK-banded hoodies, have been recorded by police teams.
How will the fiscal rules of football affect Neymar Τ's departure to Paris?
The rules for preventing unlimited spending of European football clubs will not prevent Neymar Τ from transferring France from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain.
From the prestigious Champions League tournament, the management unit, which controls the European game, to Paris Saint-Germain, has the power to repel teams.
The rules of the Financial Fair Game, issued by UEFA in 2011, mean that Neymar would eventually have to show that Neymar had financed his transfer without experiencing massive losses.
Barcelona is paid 222m euros (262m) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will rule a salary that will find tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar's departure to France:
Given your team's money from the energy-rich Qatar family, PSG can surely pay Neymar to sign it and add it to the galaxy of other stars.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to get players, but they have to balance it with legitimate revenue sources if they're in charge of their football business.
The FFP was designed by Michel Platini after he was elected head of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that large debt-laden clubs were involved in effective fraud, and that if banks or owners pulled their support, he was at risk of bankruptcy.
In 2011, the FFP began monitoring the losses of the clubs rather than focusing on their debts.
The change meant that Roman Abramovic's first model in Chelsea in 2003 (take a potential club, spend a lot of money to improve the team, and create a global brand) would become a more difficult attempt.
During the three-year FFP assessment, which continues until 2018, clubs can suffer 30m euros in losses.
Although Platini was dishonorably removed from the presidency in 2015, his successor in UEFA, Aleksander Ceferin, is still determined to give up excessive spending.
Andrea Traverso, who runs the FFP in UEFA, told the Associated Press last week: "FFFP is definitely not dead, and we will surely strengthen it by moving the rules forward."
Although the PSG will pay collectively for Neymar's purchase clause, for accounting reasons, it may extend the amount to the contract time.
Neymar signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer fee could be cited as a cost of 44.4m euros in the annual accounts of the next five years.
In 2014, the first wave of FFP agencies saw the implementation of the most heavy positions in Manchester City, owned by PSG and Abu Dhabi.
The PSG was sentenced to 60m euros ($82m for the time later reduced to 20m euros) and was ordered to limit the Champions League team to 21 players instead of 25 for the 2014-2015 season.
The UEFA is alert to clubs that can try to deceive financial regulators by inflating its income through companies connected to the owners of the club.
Although a Qatari company can sponsor PSG, UEFA will not allow it to be considered a legitimate income if it is thought that the value of sponsorship exceeds standard market value.
This is what happened in UEFA 2014 when Qatar Tourism Authority ruled that PSG sponsorship was inflated.
Some of Neymar's profits from PSG have been reportedly come through payment from Qatar's 2022 World Cup organization committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 denied Neymar would be the ambassador to the World Cup, and such a move could easily be revealed by UEFA regulators.
The sanctions imposed on PSG in the past mean that UEFA will be more careful when they try to break the rules.
The UEFA is not in a preemptive conversation with the PSG about Neymar's transfer, according to the people on Tuesday.
Since they were not authorized to discuss PSG's situation, they spoke to The Associated Press on condition that they remain confidential.
The latest published accounts show that PSG made more than 10m euros in 2015-16, with 542.4m euros in turnover.
Last fiscal year's accounts have not yet been published.
The PSG expects Neymar's arrival to contribute to sponsorship agreements, souvenirs and jersey sales.
After signing, the club expects the turnover to increase by at least 30 per cent.
The Spanish league, clearly disturbed by the departure of one of the greatest players in football, tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that the PSG violated FFP.
"This is an open'mali doping' with the club and the state," La Liga chief Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's firm ownership of PSG.
Arsene Wenger, director of Arsenal, whose club belongs to an American sports giant, shares his concerns about the financing of La Liga by a state.
On Thursday, Wenger said, "This is the result of having it, and in the last 15 years, it has completely changed the ground of football."
"When a country owns a club once, anything is possible.
It's hard to respect the Financial Fair Play because for a country like this, a great player representing a country can lead to different methods or different interests.
Insurer's 'tvan price' riot
According to TSB data, the insurance sector has been hurting traffic major since 2006.
In 2015, the sector lost $2.35 billion, and in 2016, it made only $19 million.
The Stock Exchange is being processed in Istanbul, Akigotta, Anatolian Insurance and Solar Insurance.
Speaking at a meeting review of TSB's first six-month results in 2017, the Agers said the 11-year damage to traffic insurance reached 7.3 billion euros, predicting that the cost of the sector with a ceiling bonus will increase to 2.3 billion euros this year, estimated damage-primity rate of 125 per cent this year.
"This means that by financing the bad driver, we also increase the price of the citizen's housing policy," he noted, saying the number 2015 will be caught this year.
" 75 percent of the set is foreign, and our partners abroad are sort of financing the bad driver," he said.
The ages went on to say:
We don't expect any profits from traffic, but in the past 11 years, we can't show that we're making a profit for any year.
He said, "We accept that, but in a reasonable environment, we continue to hope that we can carry the damage along with the other policies."
"In 2012, there were around 30 per cent price hikes in traffic insurance, almost doubled in 2015, we wrote the biggest damage in our history," he said, adding that there were dramatic price hikes when the traffic damage took the profit of other products.
He said, "Even in such an environment, in the end of 2016, our profits were only $19 million in traffic."
"We will lower the price of the good driver at the free rate and put a high price on the bad driver."
He said, "But the Treasury is looking at the overall progress, "the Treasury has the final word on when."
Since 2015, the Treasury Undersecretary said the rise in mandatory traffic insurance premiums has affected a large percentage of society, adding that as of April 12th, the maximum premium has been implemented.
According to this, the maximum premiums for mandatory traffic insurance policies have been set in some of the municipal groups, including each group, step and traffic density and accident statistics.
On the other hand, as of July, the practice of "The Pool of Riskli Insurance" for the high step or vehicle groups has been implemented as well.
The premium and damage to traffic insurance policies under the pool will be divided among insurance companies.
These insurance premiums will be identified by the Undersecretary of Treasury.
Ageds said that in the first six months of the year 2017, the price production dropped by 11.5 per cent compared to the same period of the previous year, and the number of policies increased by 4.9 per cent to 8.6m, and the reduction in traffic policies reached about 30 per cent, given inflation.
"This damage cannot be sustained with the price of this ceiling.
How much longer can the industry take this damage?"
"Why is the good driver financing the bad driver, why is my thousands of shareholders financing the bad driver in Turkey?" he said.
"We're trying to explain our problems to the Treasury at this point," he said.
"They haven't reached that point yet."
They expect to invest more in Turkey because the Netherlands has an average of 6 policies per person, while Turkey has 1.3.
"Turkey is literally a place to grow up," he said, and went on to say:
So they haven't given up on this place.
But even though the company earns a reasonable profit every year, it's using it to make the company grow, leaving all the profits in it.
According to TSB data, bonus production was $40.5 billion in the sector in 2016, while in the first half of this year it was $23.1 billion, up 12 per cent last year compared to the same period.
The eras predicted that the sector would not complete the year with 15 per cent growth in total production of bonuses, he said.
News of welfare for thousands of chronic patients
The details and implementation of the New Social Aid Programme for Family and Social Policy Minister Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, whose work began a while ago under instructions from him.
In the first phase, 4,300 TB and SSPE patients will benefit from the start of the welfare programme for poor citizens and their families.
Patients will receive more than two-thirds of the minimum wage as well as regular psychosocial support.
The ministry will also pay additional payments to TB patients who have been detected by the health department's relevant health department for their failure to repair their medical self-care, continue their life as bed addicts or need to improve the conditions of their home life.
The payments will be provided through PTT through Social Aid Cards.
Those who cannot go to withdraw money for reasons such as geographical conditions, sickness, disability will be paid at the door.
In many ways, the program is also the first in the world.
One of the 10 companies to invest is still German.
The political tension between the two countries is not reflected in the business world, said Prime Minister Arda Ermut, head of Turkey's Investment Support and Credit Agency.
"In relations with Germany, there is not one investor who says, 'We have suffered because of this situation, we are running away'," he said.
"About 10 per cent of the projects in our community are German companies."
Some of them have investments in Turkey.
"The Germans are an important part of our daily business flow," he said.
Ermut said that Abraaj Group's partnership with the logistics company Netlog is also a good example.
"We invested $1 billion in Turkey," Abraaj Group Partner Omar Syed said, pointing to economic growth in Turkey.
Özer is on his way to becoming the last Ottoman
The experienced football player, which the administration gave two weeks to find the club, has agreed to sign an official contract with Osmanlıspor in the coming days.
At the beginning of last season, Ozer Palmacı signed a contract with the green-black club four hours before the end of the transfer until 2019, while playing for 29 leagues and 2 Cups, with 5 goals and 4 assists in the team.
The administration, which blocked its way back to Autonomous, signed with Brazilian Sergio Antonio yesterday instead of this player.
The transfer of the century has been made!
Barcelona announced that Neymar was transferred to Paris Saint-Germain for 222m euros.
Recently, the transfer development, which has been eagerly followed by the public, has become official.
The PSG added 222m euros for the Brazilian player to the Catalan team, which cost the player his release.
Neymar was the most expensive transfer in football history at the cost of this service.
Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) of the French 1st Football League (Ligue 1) announced a five-year contract with Brazilian star Neymar.
Neymar, 25, who was awarded 222m euros for the bonservis dissolution and became the world's most expensive football player, signed a contract to the PSG until 30 June 2022, the club's website said.
"Since I started my football life in Europe, PSG has always been one of the most competitive and ambitious teams," Neymar said after the signing ceremony.
The reason I joined my teammates by coming to this club is to get a lot of trophies, just like our fans wanted."
PSG will pay Neymar 45m euros per season.
Thus, the cost of the star player will cost the representative of France more than 400m euros.
Marine workers' strike ended with a raise
A collective agreement between the Turkish Maritime Union (TDS), which is owned by İzmir Metropolitan Municipality's company, INDENIZ A.Ş. and Türk-Busa, was not reached.
After that, union workers of IMINI were on strike on July 12th.
The strike, which lasted nearly a month, ended as of 15 p.m. today after a raise was given to the workers.
According to the signed collective contract of employment, a 12 per cent increase will be made in the salary of land personnel within the IRM.
The increase is 5 per cent for personnel whose salary has increased by 25 per cent, along with the income tax exemption received after the IMDEN, which renewed its fleet, registered in the International Ship's Register.
THE Foca and Urla campaigns will begin on Tuesday, and will begin at the end of next week, the General Directorate has announced that flights in the interior Gulf will continue with normal tariffs.
"The people of İzmir will be relieved," TDS President Hasan Pekdemir said.
As a result of the strike, improvements were made to our workers who worked on land and sea.
We're leaving the table happily.
On average, an average of 28 per cent in the marine pocket and 20 per cent on land.
We had friends who worked at minimum wage.
We also made serious improvements in their salaries.
Nostalgia Niches With "Wet American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
So, for the bright days of characters in the '80s, for the grunge era of the '90s (the time when brains like David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV) and himself, for 2001, stars Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd were nostalgic for all of them before they went on with something bigger.
As a cultural product, it's the enticing of both the tic and the embodiment of our ever-ever-remembered Facebook period.
But as a series, it's like it's expired.
The "First Day of the Camp" was unexpectedly successful, and it was not just because of absurd humor (in which there was a story about the origins of a talking box of plants, which had been voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
By focusing on the real humor (the middle-aged actors playing horny children) he made it impossible to capture the past chapter of the joke.
It's now less emotional based on adult adults playing "Ten Years Later" and more random parody, including a monologue about the movie "The Hand Shakes the Cradle" in the '90s.
At some point, the character confuses an Apple Powerbook, some single file roller skates, and a lot of other things from 1991.
Most of the main stories are the same.
The softhearted Coop (Mr. Showalter) is now a writer, and he still hasn't forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor still hasn't lost his virginity.
And now there's another insane plot involving Ronald Reagan (again again, Mr. Showalter) who was led by George H. W. Bush (a very well-placed imitation by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the series is the middle line.
It's especially nice to see the young Mr. Rudd, who always had Matt Dillon's lipless beard in "The Singles," who is now the most popular boy in the old school, Andy, who looks like an old man.
There may be random moments of insanity that give power to this series (e.g. a kind of repeating "Loven Up!") until it reaches what I think is the logical result: "Wet, Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," which, in the final scene, allows the fellow crew to go to see the premiere of "Wet American Summer."
Meanwhile, "Comrade Detective" in the Amazon addresses a different form of nostalgia: "The Americans"' Cold War reviving, film "The Yellow Bomb" and even "GLOW" in iconography against Western wrestling.
A comedy by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, directed by Rhys Thomas, appears to be found TV: a 1980s Romanian police drama where two Bucharest police officers fought for real, atheism and Marxist-Leninist roads.
The leading roles are played by Gregor and the idealist Iosef, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are produced by the English dublage Channing Tatum (also the chief producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levittt.
That's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much of an idea.
There are some nice visual humors. (Police spend time watching chess on TV while Americans watch football)
The famous vocalist cast, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny, is good material for the "know who's the voice" game.
But "Comrade Detective" is so dedicated to being compared to a clumsy propaganda drama that a killer wearing a Reagan mask often plays exactly like him.
Six long episodes don't pass, and comedy isn't quick enough or often enough.
Gregor and Iosef regularly visit the American embassy, where two fat men always eat a bunch of hamburgers like hungry wolves in the lobby, while "Comrade Detective" is shortened to a narrower length, the propaganda would have done better.
The message to the imaginary communist tracker is that Western culture can transform food into food that will defeat anything in a series.
The Romanian creators of fiction were not wrong: we do this to our own recent past and even theirs.
Its ancestors, the Kadiyani.
From 50 years of experience, the British government has seen that our family is loyal and selfless.
The great authorities of the government have acknowledged that this family has long been loyal to the British government and has served in great service.
The British government has to be smart and careful about this plant they've planted with their own hands, investigate and carefully decide everything.
While trying to understand Å, the start point is to consider the organization of Hashshashi, but a forgotten elitist difference is that it is an organization that emerged during the imperialist era and is acting with colonial saiks.
It's in my opinion that the "frontal movement" should be dealt with in this minor.
At the entrance, the British praised Mirza Gulam Ahmet Kadiyani, who described himself as the "seed planted by the British government."
"On 1 December 1888, Allah ordered him to take a pledge from his followers and form a separate congregation," said Gulam Ahmed, born in Kadiyan, a small town in Punjab, India.
In 1891, when Gulam Ahmed went a little further, according to revelations and inspirations, he said that Jesus, like the prophets, had died with a certain death, and that God had sent him as the work that Christians and Muslims had been waiting for.
According to this, it's the same person that Muslims are waiting for, and that's Mirza Gulam Ahmad Kaadiyani.
(Islamic Encyclopedia, TDV)
Gulam Ahmed, who wrote books defending the persecuted Muslims against Hindus and Christians after the 1857 Sipahi uprising, reminds of Gulam Ahmed, who was thought to have been founded with purely holy saiks, as well as the leadership of the Communist Anti-Communist Association in Erzurum, which later appeared.
Gulam Ahmed's most popular idea of imperialists, like Gulam Ahmed, is that "jihad" is a struggle between Muslims and their own self, and if you can live your religion freely, the imperialism has no dimension to fight.
He even praised the attacks of the Crusaders, who were still wounded in our history, in one last year's 'vaaz, if you remember, by taking a step further, "It is not too dangerous for the pilgrim to invade your country.
Because there are red lines between you and them.
First of all, they don't touch your woman, your daughter.
They won't touch your temple, you untouched Crusaders!
The idea that the Mahdi and the messiah had merged in itself, that their community would be the savior of Islam, that the concept of jihad meant only fighting the soul, aside from the similarity of the thesis with Å, was generally the form of the spread of the womanhood in the field of education and civil society.
The number of cities in the world is 1869, and the number of countries registered officially by the Humanity First is 23.
There are also 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 dispensarys in 55 countries, 8 printers of Kadiyani in Africa alone; 505 educational institutions in 11 countries and some 16,000 mosques in the world.
Given the Nobel Prize-winning "first Muslim scientist," Prof. Abdusselam, President of the United Nations Court of Justice, Sir Zaferlah Khan, "Muslim actor who received the first Oscar" Mahershala Ali, we can see the depth of the approval of global forces to the Qadiyani.
Note that the meeting of the ladies in England last week with 30,000 people has also been polished as a body display.
One of their slogans is a brief look at their history to understand that the Kadiyani, who are like, "Love everyone, don't hate anyone," actually want to say, "Love your workers/ your colonists."
It is possible to drive the origins and motivations of structures such as Hulasa, or Tahir-ul-Kadri, to the Qadians, and all of these organisations are actually supported as matufics to promote societies to serve colonialism.
"Last request" came out of the cargo.
Emily Pomeranz, who spent her last days in a hospital in Washington due to pancreatic cancer, voiced the longing for coffee and chocolate shakes from a restaurant in her hometown.
A friend of hers contacted the owner of a restaurant called Tommy's.
Tommy Fello, who's run the same restaurant for 47 years, put his drink on dry ice and shipped it to a hospital 600km away with "fast delivery" by paying the cost of 123 dollars ($435).
Two new projects from Ahmet Kul
Ahmet Kul Construction has launched important projects such as Lavinya Park, Autoport, Vetro City, Ginza Lavinya Park, and Dia Mare in Istanbul, and Solse 7 in Bodrum Yalikavak.
The geometry of the Dia Mare project, developed by its architecture, was developed to get maximum benefit from the sea.
The Dia Mare, located on an area of 11,000 square metres, includes a total of 188 dwellings and 17 commercial units.
The project will begin to be delivered to its new owners on March 2018, when its rude nature is complete.
Dia Mare has several types of circles from 2+1 to 5+1.
In 2018, the company, which will launch two more construction sites in the Architecturaloba and Bitez, is preparing to sign two major projects in Topkapi.
He's transferred 753 million to the subsidiaries.
At the TRT, where 6,760 personnel are working, many programs have been made out and the extremities have been paid.
Republican Party (CHP) MP has again put people's taxes on AKP companies in "TRT 2016."
"This is a robbery," he said...
TRT's source to supporting production companies was provided with data obtained from official documents.
Republican People's Party (CHP) İstanbul MP Barış Ycık's official response to the application under the Information Act has shown how TRT's resources have been spent.
On the TRT, where 6,760 people worked as a staff, all kinds of technical facilities were transferred to subsidiary companies in 2016 for 753m,500,000, through programs under the name of external production.
CHP MP used the expression "The meaning of this is a score."
"The production companies of AKP journalists and businessmen are looting TRT."
"There are millions being paid for productions that are unwatched or undetected."
"The institution, which has 7,000 personnel, has returned to AKP's barley," he reminded companies that money was collected from people's taxes.
"What programs did these companies sign that 7,000 people couldn't do, so they took that money?" he reacted.
Explaining that TRT's advertising revenue in 2016 was $224,456,182 euros, he said the ad revenues remained at large when staff salaries and other expenses were taken into account.
"The TRT, which has become the voice of the AKP, can't get advertising because it's untraceable."
Feeding journalists are getting money from TRT, screaming for the AKP.
And he said, "The people are pulling the load."
"TRT pays the staff $660m a year, but gives all the work to foreign productions," CHP's Yfriend said.
753.5 trillion followers from TRT, the public's pocket.
It's a complete disgrace.
He gave up suicide. He kneeled down in front of his wife and apologized.
The incident took place at noon today in a parking lot on Millmen Street in Eyüpoğlu neighborhood.
According to information, local residents reported the situation to firefighters and paramedics who saw a citizen hanging from the fourth floor of the parking lot.
The firefighters who arrived at the scene opened a tarp in the area where the person was found, while the paramedics were standing by.
Yunus G., a 34-year-old father of three who had given up suicide after nearly an hour of convincing efforts by psychologists and police units who were called to the scene, bowed down before his wife, N.G., who watched him in tears.
On the other hand, about 100 people on the street where Yunus G. committed suicide were sitting on the sidewalks, while some citizens recorded on their cell phones.
Friday's messages will be a reminder to friends and relatives!
What time is Friday prayer?
Friday's messages continue to be investigated by citizens who will benefit from today's success and will be sent to close friends.
On this day, when citizens who will attend their meetings ask their questions at Friday prayer, the mosques will be filled with hands open to the wound.
Here are the Friday messages that have been investigated on this special day, which is very important in our religion, and the details of what time Friday prayer is.
Do not hesitate to ask forgiveness. No sin is greater than the mercy of God.
Good Friday.
Muhammad, the good Fridays of Muhammad, for God's sake and for the good.
You don't let anyone who hopes despair.
You don't turn down someone who asks you.
O Deva, be a spiritual healing for your servants, whose wealth and obedience is Zikri, whose capital is hope and weapon is prayer.
Do not turn away our hearts from you.
On us shall be the intercession of the messenger of Allah, a shining light, who greeteth his people with the light of Allah.
The prayer is love, the prayer is peace, the prayer is hope.
Have a blessed, peaceful, loveful Friday...
May you love as much as a peyg-mber!
O my Lord! make thee one of those who call on thee this day of those who give thanks and love, and make thee one of those who walk in the Garden.
Let your beauty shine upon you, and let not the smile of your face and your heart fade away.
"And that my Lord may make you (all) His chosen slaves, and us (also)."
Have a good Friday.
Make us friends with your friends, enemies with your enemies, patient and grateful.

So may my Lord say, "Indeed, I am pleased with you."
Pray so that your sin may weep from the height of your repentance.
Take refuge with the devil who created you, not with the chief, and let him burn with you.
My Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from knowledge that availeth not, nor from a heart that feareth not, nor from a soul that cannot be heard, nor from a soul that is not fed; an evil companion is he, from indecency, from being niggardly, from being driven away, from being niggardly, from being made to suffer evil, from the trial of the Devil, from the punishment of the grave, from the trial of life and death.

Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 percent
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will not change soon after it reduces speculation that slow economic growth and moving inflation will be an increase.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will continue "slow" as they maintain their interest rates, along with the narrowing of family revenues.
Decisionmakers in the bank's Financial Policy Committee (MPC) voted 2 to 6 to 2 to 2 to keep the interest rate at 0.25 per cent, so this month, less members asked for increased support for the increase in slow economic growth.
In the three-month inflation report, the bank drew growth projections to 1.7% in 2017, 1.6% in 2018, and warned that household revenues would continue to shrink as inflation is still expected to increase by 3% in the spring.
However, he signaled that interest increases are necessary to curb the inflation Brexit fueled over the next few years, and said debt costs could be more likely to increase in financial markets than expected.
The members also voted after Brexit to withdraw part of the huge economic healing package, which was launched a year ago.
Starting next February, the bank said it would end the Periodal Funding Plan, which offers cheap financing to banks, but expected it to offer £15 billion more in total under the plan.
"The centre of the MPC is slow in the short term, as the consumption of domestic real income continues to be a burden in the domestic product (GDP)," the bank said minutes after the interest decision was made.
In terms of interest, he stressed that "some reduction in money policy" may be necessary to mitigate inflation, and that the market would be "a bit higher" than expected.
Markets are still predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in the year 2020.
However, the bank emphasizes that any increase would be "step by step" and "restricted."
According to May estimates, this year's and next year's reduced growth estimates are compared to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank maintains an estimate of 1.8% in 2018.
Sterlin lost value in exchange for dollars and euros after the news.
The pound dropped 0.5% and dropped 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
According to 0.3% of GDP in the second quarter, the decision not to change came after the recent growth numbers, which have been disappointingly increasing by 0.2% in the previous three months, eased expectations of increasing growth.
Growth will likely remain 0.3% in the third quarter, but according to the bank, it will slightly increase by the end of the year.
The bank says the recession will only get worse before it improves, leaving little to rejoice over the latest inflation report, increased inflation and poor wage hikes.
The bank said its monetary policy can't "stop" revenues from being hit" over the next few years, but expects the salaries to be "importantly improved" towards the end of their three-year projections.
The increase in demand for British goods as a result of poor pounds will balance some of the reduced consumer spending and support the economy.
The decision comes a year after last August, when interest rates were reduced to 0.25 per cent after the shock EU referendum vote, which led the pound upside down.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years for this to affect prices and the economy altogether.
Prior to the bank's latest interest decision, there was a demand for increased inflation pressure on difficult households and an increase in interest by calling for three policy makers to increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation dropped from 2.9% in July to 2.6% last month, but the bank said it was expected and will increase again in the coming months.
According to their 2% target, the vaccine is all about the weak pound, the bank said.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "The mortgage market will become more competitive once again, given the recent declines in Takas rates, while lenders demand jobs and a positive closure of the year.
The market looks especially good for those approaching the end of their existing contracts in remortgment, becoming more popular than ever, along with a lot of free options and low interest," he said.
NHS will prescribe controversial HIV medicine for 10,000 people
In the Supreme Court, after a struggle to finance the drug in the NHS, the patients will be able to reach the 'transducer' HIV prevention treatment starting in September.
The NHS announced that the pre-exposure profile, a pre-exposure drug used to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk people by around 86 per cent, will be provided to about 10,000 people by health care via a three-year preliminary test.
He agreed to finance the experiment after the Supreme Court's approval of the Supreme Court last year. The resolution said the NHS had the power to pay for PREP, despite claims by local authorities to finance it.
The move, announced Thursday, was welcomed by the head of the UK, Simon Stevens, as a "new and serious intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a "turn point."
The sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first clinics to record people, and will be fully implemented throughout Britain by April 2018, with more clinics in October.
Pre-accessive profiling (PREP) is a series of HIV drugs that reduce the risk of getting HIV before sex.
Tests showed that PREP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at risk of infection.
Taking PREP before sex means there's enough drugs in a person's body to prevent an HIV infection.
These kinds of drugs can be taken every day or almost two hours before sex.
The only ones suitable for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transsexual people, and HIV-positive partners who can't be treated successfully.
Clinics will determine suitable participants from men, women, transgender individuals and people whose HIV status is controlled by anti-retroviral treatment.
Those who live in England and are registered to a GP can also register for potential participation in participating local sexual health clinics.
The programme will cost £10 million, and the NHS signed an agreement this week to provide drugs with an international bid for Britain.
The test was designed to assess PrEP's full potential by collecting clinical evidence on how the PREP was targeted, run, and performed on a large scale.
Mr. Stevens said: "This new and serious intervention will contribute to widespread and increasing success in preventing HIV.
This is another milestone in 30 years of development in dealing with one of mankind's major health problems. '
Deborah Gold, head of NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a turning point in fighting HIV.
If it is targeted correctly in those in need and in those at risk, the PREP offers the possibility of transforming the HIV epidemic in Britain.
Starting in September, people with high risk of HIV will reach a new and powerful vehicle that is actually controlled and not open to negotiating with a spouse through this experiment, funded by the NHS in Britain, which will lead to the recovery of many lives.
We welcome this announcement with a warm welcome.'
Ian Green, president of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now is to ensure that the experiment is presented quickly across the country and that no one with HIV risks is left behind.
Now that the PREP experimental drug has been provided, we are on the right track to protect more than 10,000 people with HIV risks.'
Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: "We welcome the start of the PREP experiment and are late with months of delays and then the government's resilience.
Evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our view of the prevention of HIV and the end of this life-changing infection.
The experiment will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PREP.
It is now important that this experiment is presented nationwide as quickly as possible to protect people exposed to HIV and bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.

Two secrets: death.
Former Minister of Industry and Trade Ayhan Cirlingiroğlu's daughter, Umit Makbule Çilingiroğlu (51) died from the 19th floor of a business centre, also used as a hotel in Levent, Istanbul.
24-year-old Melis Salihoglu, a student at Koç University, was also found dead in his home.
Salihoglu was alleged to have hanged himself.
Two secret deaths have been conducted in a row, considered suicide by the police.
'DEPRIF HAIRDI'
The daughter of Turkey's first Industrial and Trade Minister Ayhan Cilingiroglu, born in Washington in 1966, Umit Makbule Cilingiroğlu entered the Le Meridien Hotel in Ethir on 1 August at 5 p.m.
An ambulance and police team were called to the scene after a Kuwaiti tourist informed the hotel management of a dead body of Chilingiroglu, who had settled in the room on the 19th floor and had not been heard from for a while.
Paramedics have determined that Cirlingiroglu, who fell from the 19th floor to the hard floor, has lost his life.
"He's been depressed lately," said the mother, Mediha Chilingiroglu, who testified to the police.
He arrived in Istanbul from Ankara on 31 July.
I have a grandson who has leukemia from my other daughter.
He said, "This was taking care of my granddaughter, and she was negatively affected by my grandson's illness."
Cickingiroğlu, whose funeral has been removed to Forensic Medicine Association, is expected to be buried in Ankara.
It's being investigated whether or not a locksmith was thrown out by someone or committed suicide.
'CANINA CLEAR'
The other suspected death in Istanbul took place in Sarıyer Zechariahköy.
Melis Salihoğlu (24) who studied at Koç University was found dead in his home.
Allegedly, the young girl's father went to her daughter's house near the school, where she had no news and could not reach her cell phone.
Father met his daughter's lifeless body at home.
It was said that Melis, whose family, close relatives, and friends loved him very much, hanged himself in his home and ended his life.
Melis Salihoglu's death has drowned his family and relatives.
A friend of Melis's followed by a friend on social media saying, "We were getting hit in the face by a bright sun."
We had green grass under our feet, Jack and your best friend, and your sister, Eysan, chasing that little plastic ball, and we were in a good mood.
He shared the message, "What was the need to die now?"
Living in luxury: the hang-up and the smart design numbers have turned this little Earls Courts apartment into a spacious home.
In 2014, former banker Joanne Leigh, a passion for real estate renovations, moved from a large house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court to shrink.
It's on the first floor of a fancy Queen Anne-style gazebo, and it's proof of the new design that Joanne convinced her to pack her bags.
"Before that, I lived in a much bigger area in Knightsbridge with my ex-boyfriend," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something equal to my price.
I was shown the apartment at Earl Court, and they had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with him and made an offer that day."
After first sight, the 1,000 ft squared circle was renovated from top to bottom.
In the beginning, it was a one-bedroom and complexly planned property, and you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom, and Joanne wanted to add a storage space and a vine floor to maximum benefit from the generous ceiling.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, and lots of light.
That was my condition."
For this purpose, he hired the Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed's Erfan Azadi to take advantage of the 12.5 ft ceiling and create not only a structure but also a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling wasn't high enough to add two spaces in a row, so the architectural challenge was creating a vine floor in which you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the matter.
"The steel skeleton is very complicated," he explains.
"We had to adjust the gaps so they could pile up on each other without needing to lean down on each other.
It wasn't just building a simple platform, but at the same time the steel would bend so low that they would be at the right height, depending on the function above or below."
This arrangement also brought many additional dramas to allow Erfan to get two full - height rooms above each other.
The old copper light window from Retrouvius for the vine floor is looking at the magnificent habitat below.
The mirrored gold furniture, silver accents, and the old Serge Mouille lighting all determine the style of the bill.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding space, space and light.
The mirrors placed on both ends of the short corridor make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored ranger panel feels like a window into another room.
Mirrored units in the foyer provide a storage area for Joanne's entire set of cutlery and her zucquets.
The beauty of the living room, creating a greater sense of space, is to close the kitchen when it's not in use.
The kitchens aren't new.
What's original about this is that there's a garage-style upliftable door.
The MDF, reinforced with steel, explains the door, "We used some engineering on this one."
"He's got the weight of a balance, so when you push the door up, he really slips. "
With the clever use of the field and the storage area, Joanne has won an additional 16 square meters, an extra bedroom and a improved session plan.
"At the end of the day, what you sell is what you sell, or the value of your property has been determined," Erfan says.
"As a matter of fact, a real estate agent will go in and do a computation in the field."
They've been able to use quality material here that gives the area a luxury look as they increase the ground area.
"Malzemes are objects that you touch and thus help you build emotional attachments at home," he says.
"At home, you don't fall in love with the power lines on the wall.
These are important, but they don't shake the strings of your heart."
This is proof that through good design and increased square meters, an apartment can become something quite spectacular from something standard.
Actually, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.
In Beşiktaş with Jeremain Lens service
At the end of the one-and-a-half months of talks, he was transferred to Beşiktaş with a initially thought-for-hire lens service.
After a week of condensed talks, Lens agreed with the black-and-white team in exchange for a 5m-euro service fee.
A five-year deal has been announced that the Dutch player will receive 2.2m euros a year.
Beşiktaş is expected to make a formal statement regarding the transfer of Jeremain Lens.
Photos of famous couples' weddings
For nearly four years, the model who had an ups and downsized relationship entered the world house in Sortie, with Shikel and the actor and singer Emre Altug.
The couple immortalized the wedding ceremony, which they called "the most special moment of our lives."
Seven years later, the couple decided to leave.
The brothers are fighting over a $500 million property empire.
The two brothers are at war for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, 40 years after the dynasty of Italian families.
Former Carlton Football Club director and contractor Colin De Lutis lives three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who gave himself to the Supreme Court about how to share property and business assets in a mansion in Toorak.
Paul had been trying to get out of the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court of Disintegration debates continued.
Their mother, Anna, and her brothers, own 38 properties that are worth more than half a billion dollars since they bought a store in Collingwood, Smith Street, 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and raised it into a chain with 160 retail centers.
Sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was deposited on property, and De Lutis' portfolio currently includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento construction sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments and shopping centers in the suburbs.
As part of an agreement with their deceased fathers, Colin has two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul has one-third of the company's assets (which Paul described as "a significant driving force and a dominant personality" in the De Lutis family).
A court file says that Colin owns $316 million and Paul owns property worth 176 million.
Splitting property and cash for Paul is a controversial issue.
In his first sworn statement to the court in 2015, he wrote: "The splits proposed by Colin left him with the properties I always considered to be the best of them."
Last Friday was the first Supreme Court hearing after many failed mediations.
The brothers are also fighting over who will control the current work; Paul claims Colin left him out of it.
Colin argues that it's not true, but he accuses Paul of running some property ineptly.
Colin, in a sworn statement at first, says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots dictate to me that family is the most important priority."
With hundreds of pages of affidavits, e-mails, and the best lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and senior legal advisors held by both sides, the firms, including the Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, the case is increasing.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were a family of Italian immigrants who ran grocery stores and delis from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They pawned their property to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says that in my last year in high school, Paul founded Westco there when he was a little boy (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hope to leave their own goods friendly to their son.
He wrote, "Luigi often told me that he never wanted brothers in court."
The other two brothers Mark and Luke are no longer part of the De Lutis group; Colin said that when he quit, Mark was paid $10 million and Luke was paid $26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "displeased with the circumstances of their financial separation."
According to Eddi McGuire, the TV star's best friend in 2015, Colin tried to keep a low profile even though he was a former member of the AFL club.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and his lawyers on Friday.
Just because Colin was in court with a text message, he said, "I can't say much."
"It's very sad that my brother Paul chose to sue me and drag our family's name into court."
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote in a court application that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't want Paul and I to get into the current disagreement," he said, adding that he was still hopeful about my solution.
Looks like that hope was lost on Friday.
"Our problem will be solved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to restrict the president's media diet.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly could really do it.
That would be the first time.
Politico reports that the new White House chief will restrict the flow of information to President Trump (including news media reports) in hopes of keeping the boss more stable.
Here's a little piece of information from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the White House's new chief of staff, met with senior staff on his first day on the job, he sums up a fundamental problem President Donald Trump plans to solve on the White House: that bad information is in the hands of the president.
Kelly told the staff that information should flow through her on paper or briefings, because the president would make better decisions when good information was given.
Kelly's diagnosis makes a lot of sense, but the others tried to tame Trump by controlling the media diet and failed.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and now he's in the White House, watching TV is still in good shape.
"If Aday Trump was upset that it wasn't fair in the media, it was productive to show him that he had found a fair place in convincing media outlets," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time: "The key to controlling Trump's Twitter habit, according to six campaign officials, was to ensure that personal media consumption contained a stable flow of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit is under control at any given time is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaigners know something that the rest of us don't know, like Trump's tweets would be much more provocative without their own interference.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets Trump didn't send.
If his people were able to get him out of harm's way even a few times, then his efforts were valuable.
But no one was able to stop Trump from making a constant argument.
Part of the problem was that the White House was made up of factions competing with each other, people who, in every case, tried to advance their own agendas with material they offered Trump (which could be trusted or unreliable) and brought forward their own world view.
In May, Politico reported that during this whole story, consultants had a strategic tendency to deliver suspicious information to the president.
An example by reporter Shane Goldmacher described in detail was:
"The current and former Trump officials say that Trump has been driven to find out where they come from, which responds violently from the press to negative clippings, especially to leaks that have a bad effect.
That's what happened at the end of February when someone gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson's website, accusing Katie Walsh of being the source behind a series of leaks in the White House.
It didn't matter that Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or offered no concrete evidence or had filed false charges in the past and had returned from them.
Trump read the article and started asking staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the chief of staff at the time, Rence Priebus and White House chief of staff, Rob Porter, were "trying to establish a system that manages and documents the documents Trump received."
How did that work out for you?
Kelly's trying to do the same thing in three months.
Maybe he'll turn out to be a more effective executive than Priebus, but Trump is still in his own drive, and his aides are still competing for influence.
These constant factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Kripto exposed the "creatures" with a special template
İzmir Chief Public Prosecutor Berkant Karakaya has completed his investigation into irregularities in the "military espionage investigation" and the investigation into the leaking of certain information as part of an investigation into the secret witness code "Sarmashik" saying that Major Admiral Jihad Sagitcı was a member of the Navy Command.
Despite the fact that Major Admiral Sagittarius is not a member of the organisation, the study stressed that he helped the investigative office to decipher the members of the crypto organisation at Naval Command and played an active role in the fight against Å.
The decision signalled that Sagittarius was tried to be disabled by the Navy Command under a so-called martial law order in the coup attempt on July 15th, underlined that he had fought an effective fight against Å since the first day of the Sagittarius coup attempt.
According to Karakaya's decision of non-observation, the statement was used: "It has been understood that Yaycı was working on the identification of Krypto Corps personnel through the special template for the identification of members of the crypto-secure class and the special system created through the 64 basic criteria and the 209 lower criteria."
It has been decided that it is impossible to appreciate an assessment based on our chief prosecutor's opinion of Sagittarius, who has been known to be anti-active terrorist organization as a result of a preeminent, special and stubborn effort in forensic investigations, as well as the covert witness's lack of evidence, except for an affaki and a statement not based on a basis.
Admiral Sagittarius has been charged with defamation before.
It also turned out that there were others behind it and that the alleged crime was staged.
Former Air Pilot Commander Colonel Hakan Dinç, who complained that Sagittarius had insulted him, turned the complaint into a document in the form of an information note.
Tanker Base Commander Brigadier General Bekir Ercan Van, former Chief of Staff Co-Chair Colonel Muharrem Köse, former Chief of Staff Chief of Staff, former Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Mustafa Ozsoy, former Judge Commander Erkan Ağın, former Deniz Lieutenant Necmettin Aksoy, former Judge Akif Us and former Judge Uğin İğir İğiçi were discharged from TSK because of their ties to the prosecution.
Some members of the organisation, including Tuncay Opchin, who was the escapee, were found to have targeted Sagittarius before and after the coup attempt on July 15th.
Travelers crossed the ditch, went back to the 'rich neighborhood'
Some of the richest hosts in the West Midlands are fighting again with determined travelers who have been dug by the council to reclaim the space outside their mansion.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans outside a area that is known as Solihull's "rich neighborhood" with a well-placed street.
They returned in May after they had just been fired, bringing horses, babies, and a load of carts from the ditch, which the council had dug to cut off their raids.
The clever group found a loophole in the defense, smuggled their vehicles in through a section that was left unblocked.
Angry residents criticised the Solihull Council, saying it was "useless in solving the problem."
An anonymous resident said: "They arrived there Monday evening after being sent from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passersby.
The Council should be ashamed of their actions because they are useless in solving the problem.
Travelers were there in May, sent away, and now they're back again.
More came last night, probably more will come today."
He added: 'The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with long restraining orders to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Street, and I'm not happy to continue paying my taxes when the council can't even stop it.'
A local resident who didn't want to give his name said: "Like a joke, we saw the last group of travellers have just left, and we were immediately devastated by a new group.
They had increased numbers this time, and a horse was even seen grazing in the parking lot.'
A woman from the Solihull Council said: 'We are aware that there is an unauthorized camp on Streetsbrook Street, and we are starting legal procedures to get them out of there as soon as possible.
To support our gathering of evidence, it is vital that as many local residents call 101 and report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police.
This will help bring the picture of the case to the court's attention when we present our case to the court.'
Galatasaray reported Ndiaye to the stock market.

Galatasaray will also pay a total of 11m euros guaranteed to Ndiaye, where he signed a 4-year contract, with 2,750,000 euros per year.
In addition, Ndiaye will receive a 5,000-euro bonus for each score of the yellow-red team at TFF Super League and UEFA.
The player has the right to a unilateral dissolution of the contract for 18m euros starting on June 15, 2019, the statement announced.
Last-day rush!
They flocked to fire stations.
Thousands of vehicles were damaged, along with last Thursday's storm and hail.
Many of the drivers who received reports from the fire department to cover the damage by insurance companies, while drivers who so far have not received reports have also queued for the report.
Today, drivers with helmets and no notices came to the fire stations asking for a report due to the deadline.
Today's the last day
Drivers first had the fire department take pictures of their vehicles to identify their vehicles.
The drivers who were identified for the damage of their vehicles later reported to the officers.
Hasan Erol, who came to the fire station for the report, said, "I've made a recording. I'm going to take a photo."
There was a lot of intensity when I got here.
He said, "There was damage to the windshield."
Driver Erbil Kılıç, "We've come for a run."
We're in line.
We had the picture taken.
"Now we wait for the report," he said.
The skyscrapers with the sea and the shore wall are breathless
"The expert report on the case clearly says that these structures will not withstand an earthquake of six magnitudes," CHP Alderman Nadir Ataman warned.
The stakes, which are 25 to 30 metres below the solid rock, are said to be not so deep.
İstanbul Ataköy has left the town breathless at the high-level hotel and residences building a wall between the sea and the land.
MP Nadir Ataman of the CHP has reacted to the giant AVM, hotel and residence projects, one after the other in the district.
"80 years ago, those planning according to the wind had created the Ataturk Forest for Floria.
80 years later, however a sense of urbanism was reached, they planted giant skyscrapers in the wind corridors and changed the climate.
He said, "You can't breathe in the hospital."
"The temperature is felt 10 degrees higher because of the skyscrapers," Ataman said, expressing that buildings rising like walls on the coast of Ataköy have changed the balance of the climate.
These buildings need to be built according to the direction of the winds.
But our skyscrapers are rising above the wind corridors of Istanbul.
Wind can't get inside the county.
These structures are disrupting the balance of natural life.
Ataman said that these skyscrapers, which have damaged the environment and human health, have also cut the ties of the people of Bakırköy to the sea, saying they will appeal to the Council of Monuments on the matter and go to the judiciary.
There's no surgical treatment for hair spinning.
In cases with phenol, success has reached 83 per cent.
In this method, the diseased tissue is effectively cleansed and the tissue cavity is filled with an agent who kills hair roots.
One of the treatment techniques without surgery is the laser method.
With various lasers, the hair stems and the surrounding tissue are burned by circular dispersing rays, which allow tissue to be glued shut down during the burn.
Because of these two non-surgery methods of hair loss, patients are able to return to their social and work life in less time.
Dr. Mert Atak, stating that excessive weight, immovable life, long-term work, intense hair and body hair, and the lack of hygiene rules have caused hair to turn, indicating that among the symptoms of the disease is pain, infection, abscess, and swelling.
Italy hardens NGO's approach to immigrant rescue boats
The NGOs running an immigrant rescue boat in the Mediterranean warned that if they do not comply with the new rules affecting their operations, they will not be allowed to continue.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new charter, it will be difficult to see that they continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti told Torino in an interview with La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat run by the German charity Jugend Rettet, suspected that his crew were actively co-operating with human traffickers to facilitate illegal migration.
The charity, which has only been active for a year, has refused to comment on the content of the detailed accusations made against them by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is our most important priority, and it will be, so we are very sorry that we can't work in the search and rescue zone right now," the agency said in a statement on social media.
"We can only evaluate the charges that are being carried out after gathering all the information and being able to assess the situation."
Italian authorities have been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat Iuventa since October.
The crew is suspected to have taken in rubber boots full of immigrants delivered directly to them by human traffickers and allowed smugglers to escape on boats to be used again.
According to the prosecutor's files published by the Italian media, at least one such meeting was allegedly 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya.
The crew is under suspicion of disregarding the authority of the Italian coast guard, who oversees rescue operations in the region for more than human effort than any other purpose.
According to the charter, there was supposed to be an Italian police officer on the deck of boats like Iuventa who was clearly monitoring their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to abide by the charter so far: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and the Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The last one said on Tuesday that he considered new rules unnecessary but acceptable because he would not cause any "serious changes or obstacles" in his rescue operations.
Among those refusing to sign are the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
By the way, Minniti said the sharp decline in the number of immigrants coming to Italy following the rescues in the past weeks is a sign that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast security and co-operation with local governors have paid off.
"We have started to see the light at the end of the tunnel in the last few days," he said.
This month, Libyan governors announced their plans for further talks on economic development initiatives and measures to reduce the number of immigrants who have left these countries with Chad, Niger and Mali in hopes of reaching Europe.
Last-minute punch!
In Moscow, Russia's capital, a watermelon was eaten and drank vodka, as every year during the celebration of "the Day of Parasite troops."
A Russian who attended the event and drank too much and attacked Russian NTV television correspondent Nikita Razvozjayev, who was live in Gorki Park.
"Please shut up," he warned the reporter, who reported the day's developments on live television, who suddenly appeared and cursed, "We're going to contain Ukraine."
The drunk man identified as a former parachutist punched him hard on the reporter's warning.
The reporter, stunned by his fist punch, tried to get away from him.
Millions of people watched the moment of shock live.
Economic Co-ordination Board convened
The Economic Co-ordination Board (ECK) met as Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek, in charge of the economy.
Following the government cabinet change, the first ECK meeting, led by lightning, began at 6:30 p.m. at the Çankaya Mansion.
Turkey's macroeconomic outlook will be discussed at the meeting.
Minister of Finance Naci Ağbal, Science, Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü, Labour and Social Security Minister Jüliide Sarıeroğlu, Customs and Trade Minister Bkent Tüfenkci, Development Minister Lütfi Elvan, Treasury Undersecretary Osman Çelik, Central Bank President Murat Cetinkaya and relevant bureaucrats attended the meeting.
It's possible to get rid of the hernia in 45 minutes.
Noting that only 5% of patients should be operated on in the treatment of the hernia, the Assoc. Dr. Oğuz Karaemins say, "The first step, according to the patient's examination and imaging results, is rest and medication."
Oğuz Karaemin's sons have warned that in the group where the pain continues, entrepreneurial methods should be tested (epidural injections, radiofrequency techniques, inside disc initiatives), "If all these methods fail to achieve success, then surgery becomes mandatory."
The sons of Karaemin also say that the 'full closed hernia surgery' today minimises the ability to reduce the inhibitions of patients who are inattentive to perform surgery, saying that it is possible to get rid of hernia in 45 minutes:
Although microscopic surgery and open surgery have pretty good results, after the operation, there may be some complications such as long recovery period, staunchness to the spinal cord, repetitive hernia and future lumbar slips and infections.
Microscopic surgery is often described as closed surgery, but microscopic surgery is applied in the same way as open surgery.
And in a closed hernia surgery, the risks are gone because the surrounding tissues are preserved.
Full closed hernia surgery only takes 45 minutes.
Special Commission at work
The commission will include CHP MPs Mehmet Gökdağ, Cemal Okan Yüksel, Barış Ycık and High Disciplinary Board member Turan Aydoğan.
The Commission is Berberoğlu's 14th of October.
He will also follow his trial at the High Criminal Court and the appeals made to the Constitutional Court and the District Court of Appeals.
"The independence and neutrality of the judiciary, the failure to take orders from anywhere except the law, is an indispensable condition of justice," CHP Secretary-General Kamil Okyay Sindır and Vice-President Bulent Tezcan wrote in the post.
"Our public defender, Mr Enis Berberoglu, did not request any special status when he served as a member of parliament, he did not take refuge in the immunity armor known to his parliament, he wanted to maintain his faith in the independence and neutrality of the judiciary," it was said.
The judicial process has been suggested that the court would rather follow political orders than make a trial.
Despite the Constitutional Court's misjudgment of lawmakers' arrests, the court's decision to arrest has been made under the influence of the court, the article argued.
Michelle Carter was punished for messages encouraging Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide via text messages and phone calls.
At the age of 20, Michelle Carter will be serving 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years of legal release.
Carter was convicted in June of the murder of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
At the hearing Thursday, Mr. Roy's father said: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to go free, with a clear path to the confiscation.
Although he faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, his legal team argued that he and Mr. Roy were suffering from mental illness.
Carter, wearing red pants and a cream-colored blouse, was punished with old eyes, with tight hands and eyes staring down at the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
He ended her life to heal his.
He did not accept responsibility."
"He showed no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said, "It was a terrible situation that he was completely regretting."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not see that "his age, maturity, or even mental illness had any significant impact on his actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Mr. Roy's mother, Lynn Roy: "There is no day where I will not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I've handled everything, and I'm trying to be there for his sisters with all the pain we're going to carry forever."
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that he could never attend his brother's wedding or that the reality that he could never have been to his children was "in his mind."
"The fact that the person you've been with every day since I was born is no longer a pain that will always be with me for the rest of my life," he said.
Since there's no Massachusetts law that considers it a crime to tell a person to commit suicide, it looks like it's going to create a case.
Mr. Roy was 17 years old when he was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a car in 2014.
When the case revealed that Carter's text messages encouraged him to end his own life, it drew national attention.
While he was on vacation with his family, she sent a lot of messages two weeks before his death, saying, "Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are a lot of ways."
In the moments before his suicide, he wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad," and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz has instructed the press not to allow him to benefit from this case through his request to draw attention through the death of Mr Roy.
The case divided legal views.
Among the minorities who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007, two years before she was exonerated.
"Micelle Carter deserves understanding and assistance, not imprisonment."
A dramatic growth forecast by Mehmet Simsek
In his statement, lightning said inflation should be reduced to low single-digit figures in Turkey and that food inflation is "a risque area."
The Deputy Prime Minister predicts inflation will drop below 7 per cent in 2018.
In his speech, lightning said:
The lack of uncertainty is critical for the next 12 months.
The biggest incentive is to reduce uncertainty.
There's a strong government.
No political ambiguity.
I hope the uncertainty of our nearby geography is less.
With some reform, I believe that by increasing our resistance to shocks, we'll put Turkey in a trend of growth over 5 per cent.
I said it months ago.
Because the worst is behind us.
Little by little, we no longer have to focus our energy on those areas, but on reforms that will allow our energy to grow, to increase employment.
So the next 12 months are critical.
On the one hand, there's reform, there's uncertainty, there's no political uncertainty.
Hopefully, we'll get lucky, and we'll have less problems in our nearby geography.
Many of our classic markets have collapsed, whether we like it or not.
Libya, Iraq.
We're not just losing Sunday, we're dealing with over 3.5 million migratory waves.
As we look at the last 15 years, Turkey has grown 5.7% despite all these shocks.
Turkey, we have our foundations, we have our solid problems.
Now, with some reforms, we can increase our resistance to shocks, a little bit more than the question marks on investors' heads, and re-establish Turkey's growth policy.
I'll be honest with you. We have this generous retirement system from here.
I think it would be reasonable if I told you that our retirement companies didn't try hard enough.
Once in a while, the performance will be strong.
Why?
Because we took precautions.
The firms don't have to go and make an effort and make an effort.
In view of these concerns, we worked out how to allocate global assets to what investment areas, considering the poorness of performance.
You know, there's a lot of money in there.
For once, there will be a performance there in addition to the 25 percent the state has clearly given.
The rest is for treasure paper, where the risk is usually low.
When we look at the big picture, I think you'll get more attention in the coming period.
Because they'll see the performance.
There's not a failure in the other field, there's success.
We reconstructed BES in 2013.
There are 6.8 million participants, 70 billion dollars in savings.
I'll give you that. The system's a success.
There are 2.6 million participants in auto-accession, $775 million in savings.
We want a little more effort from the firms.
Get some publicity, tell them about this system.
We're working on a resuscitation period.
Maybe if we stretch him a little bit...
We'll see, we're working.
Maybe the citizens will see the yield, see the savings, and stay in the system.
We've got 38 percent coming out of the system.
Almost half of the break-ups are voluntary pensioners.
You don't want two individual pension accounts.
What are you doing?
You're coming out of auto-accession.
We were actually expecting a recluse around 10%.
Which means we were very optimistic.
First of all, the system works.
We brought a ceiling to the prime.
Insurance companies are sometimes one-sided.
They've increased their premiums too fast.
When we asked what was going on, they said the judicial decisions didn't take into account the current arrangements.
We've made new clear arrangements.
We said, "Do what you have to do."
They said no, we wait for judgment.
And we said, "That's not how it works."
We have a difference of opinion here.
Of course, when this ceiling went into bonus practice, some firms took over.
We've made a new arrangement.
We built a pool of risky insurance.
I'll tell you this, I'll say it again.
I prefer this system to work through competition.
I mean, I don't think these ceiling price apps are right, they made us do it.
I'd like to see it in three dimensions.
Let the system we've built be considered.
Two, let the system function normally, a price on that path.
In addition, their loads are heavy, nearly $30-31 of every $100 bonus paid goes to tax SGK cuts.
I'm working right now, so we're gonna talk to our finance minister.
Thirdly, technology is rapidly developing.
Now, in time, car accidents will be severely reduced, structurally.
But it's mandatory traffic insurance.
THE headline of SABAH saved your leg
Since puberty, Burger's disease was a disease that used to occur in men, but now it's becoming common in women as well.
One of these women is Mehtap Dursun, 36.
The pain that started two years ago became chronic on the soles of his feet.
The young woman who was having trouble walking was at risk of losing her leg, so the hospital went to the hospital.
A friend recommended Prof. Dr. Yusuf Kalko.
The headline at SABAH showed that "Azerbaijan saved the life of the Minister of Emergency."
So it turns out Dursun, on his way to Kalko, was struggling with Burger's disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko has taken the young woman into emergency surgery.
Soon after he recovered from his pain, Dursun is now being treated for oxygen.
Audi will modify 850,000 Diesels while Automakers Against Reverse Reaction
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The head of the BMW board said he believes that the company has "more intelligent options than the driving restrictions," including the BMW's centre (including Munich, which includes ban or restrictive vehicles).
Daimler said on Tuesday that he would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the firms described these moves as recall.
European car manufacturers strongly encouraged diesel tools to help meet carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States.
But the nitrogen oxides released by diesel engines are considered cancer-producing and can cause asthma.
The cost of equipment that automotive companies need to wear to neutralize the dirty smoke produced by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making the price of automobiles difficult to keep competitive.
While German car manufacturers face reviews, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has been accused of spoiling powerful automobile companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.
The firms try to hide the device known as a decoy device and adjust the emissions to fit the regulations when a car is tested and avoid repeating Volkswagen's mistakes, which loosened it in normal driving conditions.
Many Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month in the Audi engine development department, the former president of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
The former director, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian and therefore is not protected from extradition and may be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was dragged into a German criminal investigation, including the Volkswagen, and after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to avoid emissions in Europe, they expanded the United States-based investigation.
Audi's involvement in the investigation may be hard on the Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer has an excessive share in Volkswagen's profits.
Don't jump into everything you see
Prof. Dr. Yusuf Şükrü Çağlar, president of the Turkish Neurosurgery Association, warned not to jump from 2m to shallow ground, not to be sure of its depth.
Each year, thousands face the risk of paralysis due to a broken neck and spinal injury due to diving into shallow waters.
Neck fractures develop most frequently in the fifth or sixth vertebrae.
The condition of the fractures is that it affects the nerves that feed the muscles of the arms and legs at this level as well as the respiratory muscles.
"In such accidents, our most valuable organ, the cervical spinal region, is cut off by the broken spine or is compressed out of function," said Prof. Dr. Agelar.
"The wrong first aid in spinal injuries is not only increasing damage to survivors, but it can also lead to death," he said.
Diving into the water ranks fourth in spinal injuries.
The average age of the injured is 20-29, and the majority is male.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar said, "Do not jump into invisible water."
He said, "No matter how well he dives, there could be a severe injury."
Prof. Dr. Çağlar also reminded me:
There are different levels of paralysis in the arms and legs, depending on the level of spinal cord where the injury is caused by diving.
You may know how to swim, but water can be deceiving.
The place that looks deep to you might be shallow.
Warning plates placed on the coasts of the United States and Australia have reduced by 70 percent in cases of shallow water diving.
"Despite the fact that 28 provinces are on the coast of the sea in Turkey, there is no sign of warning anywhere outside Istanbul, unfortunately."
"In regards to such life-suffering accidents, " he said, "every county needs to be kept in a remarkable manner under the health department, schools and social awareness project, "in the beaches and pools, "or the information boards.
Prof. Dr. Kadir Kotil, president of the Turkish Neurosurgery Association Spinal and Periferic Neurosurgery Group, suggested that if injured, the following be done:
The first thing to do is call 112 at the time of the incident.
The neck must be held as steady as possible, not moved, with a hard collar.
The airway must be provided, and the patient must be inverted for drainage of the water that runs into the lung.
It shouldn't be grabbed by the legs and lowered to drain the water.
The disorientation of the patient's neck should not be attempted.
His cervical vertebrae could be broken.
However, if the spinal cord has not yet been damaged, first aid and an inappropriate position to be placed on the neck during the patient's transport could cause broken bone fragments to compress and sever the spinal cord.
Provence lavender threatened by climate change
It had become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is suffering from drought-like conditions and disease - bearing insects, causing scientists and farmers to suffer a great deal of pain trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "The lavender in Provence is in danger because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, much less in the spring and often in autumn.
This affects the lavender's life.
There's also a small cicada with a leaf pest that transmits microbacteria, and there's a lot of them in very dry air."
And a lot of things are at stake.
As much perfume and cosmetics as he attracts vacationers, he's going after lavender oil.
Eric Chaisse said: "With a few large flowers, we should have very long plant ears, but we have smaller, less developed, or less vulnerable ears.
So we've got less emasculated pieces of oil."
The revised solutions include better distribution of water and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but spraying plants with a protective mixture of slime and water and developing more resistant species to dry conditions.
Reporter's murder underlines growing threat in Mexico
The weekly newspaper Riodace's staff usually meets on Wednesdays to review the latest disturbance in the province of Sinaloa, the latest in organised crime, the plans for corrupt officers and endless drug wars to take part in the newspaper.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to discuss their safety.
They were told it was important to change their routine.
Two senior journalists are discussing what makes them feel safer: bringing their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: hostiles, neutrals, allies.
They want reporters to offer names for each column; they don't need any evidence, they need perceptions and internal voices.
Journalists suspected of drug traffickers, politicians, business people, government or cartels on their payroll are the bad guy who made it dangerous to write the chaos of a list of Mexicans in the paper.
There are no stops in violence, there are more journalists across the country: According to the Committee for Protection of Journalists, there are at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took over in December 2012; 589 are under federal protection after the attacks and threats, and seven more have died in seven states so far.
Among the last to die are editors and inspirational sources, his co-founder, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," says Valdez, in one of his many books on narcotics violence.
His absence is deeply felt, but his presence is hanging on the front of Riodace's building with a large picture of Valdez's middle finger everywhere; two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts that show his smile, his glasses, and the sign of his Panama hat.
The study takes place less than two months before his death; reporters talk about shared traumas, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecution was formed in 2010 to handle journalist cases, according to the Committee for Protection of Journalists, only two were prosecuted.
As with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, journalists' killers are rarely brought before the law.
In Riodace, though their hearts are broken, they insist on referring to the violence in Sinaloa, even though the ground is now more deceptive.
Without knowledge of the killers, without justice, the security is of little use, says Ibarra.
"It's stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodace office in Culiacan, the state capital.
His red Toyota Corolla was only able to drive a few blocks before being stopped by two men; he was forced out of his vehicle and shot 12 times, probably for the name of his newspaper, which was translated into the Twelveth River.
The gunman got into his car and drove off and hit the vehicle nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He's got a wife and two grown-up kids left.
Rumors in Culiacan tend to roam freely.
But there's almost nothing about Valdez but silence.
Last year, after Guzman was arrested and returned to the United States in January, rival groups fought to fill the void, Sinaloa became one of the most bloody battlefields in the country.
Never mind that every day in Sinaloa, one or many people will be shot to death or the cemetery's drug lords will be filled with fancy, double-story mausoleum mausoleums that are bigger than many homes to live in.
For a minute, forget the "resistence" situation where only one cartel controls its precious ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, while he was fully aware of the dangers of Valdez's work, Riodace's co-founder and manager, Ismail Bojorquez (60), was devastated by guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was an interview with Damaso Lopez, leader of one of the rival cartel groups in the war with Guzman's sons.
This summer may have angered the sons; likely gang members bought every copy of the raid as soon as it was distributed to the newsstands.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the same story was confiscated.
Valdez was a legend abroad and abroad, and his murder was seen as a turning point in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.
He was an experienced reporter in Noroeste in 2013 when he joined five of his colleagues in selling $50 shares in the discovery of Riodace.
"It was impossible to be a journalist in Sinaloa without mentioning the matter of neurocotics," said Bojorquez.
In time, the newspaper became famous for its bold and honest news, and sales and ads increased.
Journalists loved to publish vital research without fear of censorship, and readers were caught up in a publication where they could read stories that no one had the courage to report.
Eight years after his establishment, Riodace won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for journalism in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award for the Committee for Protection of Journalists, no matter where the end of the Mexican drug story is.
She admitted she was obviously scared.
During the CPJ awards, he said, "I want to keep living."
In an interview with Rompeviento TV, drug trafficking in Sinaloa said "is a way of life."
"You must accept your duty as a journalist, either this or you play the fool.
I don't want to be asked, "What were you doing in the face of so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
Riodace personnel miss Valdez, the joker who swears like a porter, his friends who are generous in his embrace and counsel, his teachers who know how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He used to go to a bar across the street from the office called El Guayabo and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask: Has his love for his routines collapsed?
His death forced them to question their own assumptions as to how they would best do their jobs and survive.
"They don't like it if you deal with their women, their children, their clean jobs, the secret airstrips they use to transport drugs."
"These things were crossing the line," Bojorquez said.
The result, even at the best of times, was a high degree of self-preservation and self-preservation.
Trusting your own instincts.
If it smells bad, stay away.
"The smell is a deceiving sensation... and what happened to Javier has happened," Riodace editor Andres Villarreal said.
He and others say the old rules in Sinaloa don't apply, just like they don't apply in the other states that hosted Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other corrupt government officials, which are a toxic mixture.
The floor keeps changing.
In the room where Riodace personnel meet for security training, all of a sudden no cell phones are allowed; days ago, spyware sold only to governments turned out to be used to spy on journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers wanted to get rid of 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius) in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodace's office in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood in Culiacan.
Half-seriously, some of the reporters were wondering if these officers were one of the 50 percent of the police that the governor himself said was untrustworthy.
It has been months since reporters went to the rural countryside where drug gangs actually controlled it.
In this week's issue, Riodox examines three main stories.
Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was murdered in Sinaloa.
In addition, the governor had been exposed to government spending focused on his hometown.
And a block from the D.A.'s office, there was a group abduction at Culiacan's most expensive restaurant.
There was no official explanation for who had been kidnapped or how, so when it came time to write down what everyone in the city knew, caution took place: the restaurant was the favorite of both drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from official records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), who dominated almost every level of politics in the past century.
Recently, many PRI governors have been accused of corruption in sensational events.
Villareal asked the reporter to write about earlier events, including one of the sons of "El Chapo" Guzman in a military raid.
They only read it months ago, looking at the corner of Valdez for the best source of information on the abduction.
"We already knew what was going on before," said Villareal (46), nicknamed "El Flaco" because of its fine nature.
"At this moment, all communication channels with our resources have been cut off."
As the staff transforms into activists on behalf of the press, on behalf of what they least expect, Valdez' office is being reused as a warehouse for banners and stickers protesting journalist murders.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez picked up some banners and went to the show the next morning for another journalist in the local prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western province of Michoacan.
A burned body was found, and according to the DNA tests, the authorities say it was him.
Journalists across the country expressed their thoughts louder by writing "help the press" on sidewalks and buildings during organised protests.
Today, Director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to provide international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and of murdering them for telling the truth.
After that day, he wanted to be assigned to a task other than to do government news, thinking that his anger had damaged his neutrality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "circled" by organised crime, co-conspirators, officials and a reckless society.
In his latest book "Narko- newspapering," he wrote that journalists were being killed not only by drug gangs, but by orders of politicians and security forces in co-operation with organised crime.
Media observer group Articulo 19 has linked more than half of the attacks on journalists last year to police and officials.
Ramirez said, "You'll die in Mexico because they want to silence you."
The murders were clearly caused by a cold shower.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a note signed by the Zetas cartel, "I'm here because of my news."
A computer keyboard and headphones are ricocheted next to his severed head.
After the murder of reporter Miroslava Breach in the northern border state of Chihuahua in March, some publications, such as El Norte, chose to shut down.
As El Manana from Nuevo Laredo did after his managers were killed in 2004, others continue.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels with the title on the front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled their own states, even the country.
It's a twisted decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still combing the streets, waiting for danger.
Sometimes, three months after fleeing Veracruz, four women and the photographer, Ruben Espinoza, who were murdered in an apartment building in Mexico City, were captured in 2015.
It's a daily dance with high-risk decisions for those who stay behind and continue to work.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, says that reporting on the drug trade scares him.
He said, "Mexican's going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter."
In the middle of a recent Saturday night, when the final issue was being completed, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, and started ringing phones at the same time.
A series of armed conflicts involving rival gangs and security forces near Mazatlan, a beach resort, resulted in 19 confirmed deaths.
As promised in a series of nearby cartel messages, the war continued to escalate.
They put it on Riodace's website through cell phones on the sidewalk.
The front page would have to be changed the next day.
The sirens started beeping nearby, there's another gunfight in the vicinity.
Bojorquez quickly glanced at the police officers standing guard to see if they were on guard.
If they were scared, they wouldn't show it.
Under the enormous portrait of their newspaper founders, his middle finger was displayed for all Sinaloa to see, and Riodace's staff followed his footprints.
"How do you think you can shut it down," said Bojorquez, "the day Javier was killed, when the intern asked me to send him out on the street to cover for me?"
He used camouflage to avoid dinosaur enemies.
It looks like a statue at first glance, but a terrible one.
Researchers have now explained that the early findings of an incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner are well preserved, and experts describe it as the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
It was so well preserved that they could tell that the scaly skin was redish brown and they could tell that it had a troubled history.
The report in Current Biology described it as the best-preserved armoured dinosaur found and one of the best dinosaurs in the world.
Fossil is a newly discovered nodozor species that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago from the middle of the Cretaceous Period.
He was amazed by the extraordinary well-preserved situation, the researchers who described him as truly wonderful.
The plant-eating armor, according to reports in National Geographic, is the best preserved fossil found in its own species.
Shawn was found by Funk on March 21, 2011, digging the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that looked strange compared to the rock around him and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil recovered was sent to the Royal Tyrell Paleontology Museum.
They spent the next six years uncovering wild animals from within a mass of £2500 (1100 kg) of earth.
After so much hard work, the completed result is now ready to come out.
Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrell Museum, where the creature is exhibited, said, "If you squint a little, you might even believe he's almost asleep."
'As one of the most beautiful species of dinosaurs in science history and the best preserved species, it will be the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
By examining his skin, researchers found that even though it was coated in armor and resembled a walking tank, this plant eater was likely facing a serious threat from the meat-eating dinosaurs.
The dinosaur, which is heavily armoured, used its red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique that many of today's animals, also known as contrasting.
Experts claim that it was hunted by larger dinosaurs, allowing it to blend in better and overcome its enemies.
The 110 million-year-old nodozor family was first published in May, and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrell Paleontology Museum.
The researchers now finished their work and named the wild animal Borealiopelta markmitchelli, a museum technician, Mark Mitchell, one of the team that spent more than 7,000 hours trying to uncover it.
The extraordinary preservation of the species made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and his team of international scientists to document the shape and shape of stamps and armor on the body.
In the animal kingdom, they've discovered a common form of defense, and they've discovered the contrast shading, which means that the upper part of the creature is darker than the lower part.
Contra shading is common, but the findings are surprising, because the size of Borealiopelta is far beyond the size of today's living controversial animals.
This means that the dinosaur has been pressured and hunted enough by meat-eating dinosaurs, rather than confronting evolution as a means of survival.
But the most modern animals (for example deer, zebras or armadillos) that use counter-shadow shading are much smaller and explain much more to be a prey, which means that the nodozor faced a serious challenge to survive.
"Strength hunting against a giant heavily armored animal shows how dangerous dinosaur predators can be in the Cretaceous," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds on his stamps also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was redish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for clues to its life, including preserved bowel contents, to find out what it ate in its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur dies, it falls into a river and drifts to sea, where it sinks to the surface of the ocean on its back.
At that time, Alberta was as hot as South Florida is today, and the rivers and oceans were probably further inland than they are now.
"The Nodozor is truly remarkable, completely covered in scaly skin and preserved, while the original shape of the animal is also preserved in 3D," Brown said.
'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today, just as it does in the early Cretaceous.
You don't need much imagination to rebuild it; if you squint a little, you might even believe it's almost asleep.'
The Cretaceous was when giant teropods, flesh-eating dinosaurs on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although he was the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years after Borealiopelta, an armored dinosaur that could have been hunted by some formidable ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a monster of 38 ft (11.5m) long, six tons.
Scientists in Current Biology magazine believe Borealiopelta was dragged into the sea after his death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, digging the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, this is the best-protected armoured dinosaur, including leather and armor, and it's perfect from nose to thigh.
The creature is approximately 18 ft. (5 m) and weighs up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
It has two 20-inch horns coming out of its shoulders.
Researchers believe that this armoured herb feeder is now hobbled in the western Canadian area until it is dragged into the open sea by a flowing river.
But the dinosaur's grave under the sea preserved its armor in perfect detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular species are so well preserved that the skin fragments still cover the bumpy layer of armor along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a protection is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at her, the more incredible she is.
Fossilized pieces of skin still cover the bumpy layer of armor in the dinosaur's skull.
His right front leg is lying next to him, and he's leaning five fingers up.
I can count the stamps on the soles of your feet."
Don't get your teeth whitened.
White teeth and an aesthetic smile are every man's dreams.
While people resort to various ways to bleach their teeth, the head of the Oral Laser Applications Association, Nukhet Berk, warns that food sold at the market or on the Internet should be avoided.
"The whitening of teeth can be provided with fine porcelain surfaces, like chemicals used by dentists or fingernails attached to the surface of teeth," Nukhet Berk said.
The protection of dental health prevents many diseases, and aesthetic practices are important for mental health as well as for good dental and dental health and a good laugh, Berk notes:
Young people's teeth are usually white as long as there are no defects or genetic factors in their dental structures.
The teeth are darker over the years because of aging, drawing tooth vervains, and frequent consumption of cigarettes, corrosive or dark beverages.
The bleaching of the teeth can be provided with chemicals applied by dentists or fine porcelain surfaces that are applied on the surface of the teeth without minimal or corrosion, like denture nails.
The teeth must never be bleached with products sold at the market or on the Internet.
Because these substances draw the vervain surface, and the teeth are colored so that they will never be recycled.
From the City of Goatören, 2011, the municipality is giving elderly, disabled and bedridden citizens "The Dental and Mouth Health Service at home."
"My wife has been informed of this service by the Goatören municipality, which has been living in bed for 24 years in the Awakening neighborhood of Goatören."
We called the city, they came right away.
"I'm already paralyzed from the neck down, so at least I don't neglect my dental care."
"My mother has been addicted to bed for 7.5 years because of old age," Kezban Gökçe, a 72-year-old daughter of 95-year-old Gulizar Taşscioglu, who lives in Pınarbaş neighborhood.
When I came to City Hall, I saw the posters of this service, and I called right away.
We've been getting this service regularly for four years.
I have trouble with my teeth, too, and when the doctors come, they look at me.
He used the phrase, "We're very pleased."
There is no health insurance requirement for the service, which is completely free of charge.
Turkish military incident "employee"
My dear readers, most interesting decisions have been made, especially for the Navy, during the meeting of High Military Shura (YAS) the other day.
This is the commander of the Force, not the admiral, but the admiral.
It's almost unprecedented in our army.
And how did that happen?
Commander of the Force, Admiral Bulent Bostanoglu, had already completed his term, had already retired...
And it happened.
Now it was his turn to command the only Admiral Veysel Kösele.
Veysel Pasha, who was a victim of conspiracy in the past and was imprisoned for some time, was supposed to be in command of the order of normal seniority.
But the government didn't want him.
I'm trying to make this very clear, starting at the top of the Marine Corps, the commanders 1, 3, 4 and 5. They haven't been promoted.
In that case, the Admiral is the only one left in the Navy.
He was supposed to be brought into the ejaculatement office: Navy Commander Oram Admiral Veysel Kösele in number two.
And then what happened?
Vice Admiral Adnan Ozbal, ranked sixth, was appointed by the government.
Now look at this painting!
Admiral Veysel Kösele is standing there, but instead he is appointed a lower-ranking commander!
A senior officer is being put under the orders of a senior officer.
I wonder what happens next.
A high-ranking admiral does not serve or perform the duties of an underprivileged general.
He doesn't take orders from her, he doesn't take them.
In that case, Veysel Kösele will not suffer this hurtful situation, and if he hasn't been transferred, he will resign today or tomorrow.
That's the hurtful message given to him by the government: "Goodbye, Veysel Pasha!"
Yesterday afternoon, when I wrote this article, word had spread that he had resigned, but the situation hadn't been officially announced.
Now let's look at this again!
The government has opposed Veysel Kösele for one reason or another, reluctantly, forced him to resign, and has replaced him with a 6th-place commando and undermined our army's traditional concept of seniority.
There must be politics involved, but we don't know behind the scenes.
Maybe if someone tells us soon, we'll all find out!
Dear readers, I've tried to make it very brief upstairs, especially in the Turkish army, the seniority is very important.
Not just in rank.
For example, the officer who finished the Academy of Harps in the 10th place is more senior than the one who finished in the 11th row.
He's more senior to the general than to the first ranking, second-place promotion.
We've had concrete examples of this seniority incident in the Instigative War.
Commander Ismet Pasha of the Garp Front...
He's got two armies at his disposal.
Army and 2nd Army.
It's 1922, and our armies will launch a massive attack and drive out the Greek army.
At this stage, there are valuable names that are expected to be assigned to military command.
One is Refet Pasha.
He's being offered command of the army, but he says, "I'm no senior, I can't take his orders."
Another name is Jacob Sevki (Subaş) Pasha.
Ataturk's instructor at the Harp Academy...
He's a high-value, high-ranking commander who he loves, who he values, who he calls "The Teacher," who's been involved in various wars.
In 1919, he was captured with military and civilian Turkish intellectuals and driven to Malta by the British.
On his return to the dorm, he is reluctant and says the same thing about military command: "The commander of the Western Front is senior, I can't take orders from him."
Ataturk, however, is grateful for his request, and Jacob Sevki Pasha accepts the command of one of our two armies.
The third is a very colorful name...
Ali Ihsan (Sabis) Pasha.
A soldier who talks a lot, criticizes all the time.
A commander who fought in Iraq, Caucasus, Iran and various fronts.
He is also exiled by the British to Malta, where he escapes and comes to Ankara via Kuşada.
When offered command of the army, Ali İhsan Pasha says the same thing: "I cannot fight under the command of Ismet, who is not senior to me."
But he's being persuaded...
However, after he's begun his mission, he's constantly arguing, making a scene with Ismet Pasha, the commander of the Garp Front, and making the army uneasy...
And shortly before the big attack, he's being relieved of duty and sent to retirement, replaced by the bearded Nurettin Pasha.
After that, Ali Ihsan Pasha never gets along with Ataturk.
The problem of seniority in the Turkish army is not only at war, but also at peace.
Of course he has to.
Veysel Kösele is the last example of this.
How did an activist have to find out the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shaken.
The day after he came to New York City for a trip, he sat in the bed of Airbnb, rented by a local resident of St. Louis, and started on Facebook on his phone.
It came from someone in high school who shared it.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he's still lying on the street."
He was surprised that no one else shared that information in the content flow, so he turned off Facebook and turned on Twitter.
A user named @TheeParoah was constantly tweeted in its content flow.
The rapper from St. Louis County was tweeting Michael Brown's death live, killed Ferguson in Missouri by an 18-year-old, unarmed black, white police officer.
He shared a picture of Brown's dead body on the street that was going to be there for four hours.
Ferrell thought to himself, "This is brutal."
But death was nothing new to him or his people.
He left his phone later that same evening at Canfield Drive to return to tweets about people's gathering.
There were police tapes, people yelling, and photos of a man who claimed to be Brown's father with a banner saying, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched a live feed of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another cop said, he pulled the trigger on his rifle and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembered saying, "This is unusual."
"'This isn't the kind of murder we used to call typical.'
That's when I felt the chills.
I was angry and crying."
He booked a return ticket and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to go with her to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is coming to the movies on August 11th, the subject of a new documentary called "Who Are The Streets?"
It's a story from the point of view of survival and protest, love and loss, power and resistance, the people who live in that society and fill the streets with the answers they're looking for.
Ferrell was driving his car to Ferguson with his daughter in a flowered dress and wearing a proper crown for him, and they went back to talking about the experiences of blacks and blacks that they had done so many times that morning.
"Remember when I taught you that black people should fight for what they believe?"
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that wasn't true.
I couldn't not take it," Ferrell said later.
"What happened here today... is the result of what happened in the past.
He needs to know, see, and grow into it.
He must not only grow in the field of activism and organization but also know the layers of his black experience and his black condition and what we must do to free ourselves.
If I'm lucky enough to give him an experience where he won't experience rude racism personally, he'll be no different than any other black woman-child.
I feel like I'm doing her a bad thing by protecting her from them."
When they arrived in Ferguson, their first stop was on South Florissant Road, where they expected to talk to Officer Darren Wilson about what led to his absence of criminal activity.
There Ferrell and his daughter contacted local business owners who prepared packed food.
They packed bags and helped deliver them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new form of activism was slowly taking shape.
When he was a student at Missouri State University, he found that he was president of the Association of Minority Students Nurses and focused on food justice and injustice in the black community, and said, "My conduct turned completely after 9 August."
"I had no experience in organising.
It came on its own."
Weeks later, Ferrell met with Sabaah Folayan, a co-director of the film at an evening screening.
Folen said he and his own cinematographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "tell" what was going on.
Ferrell had a question: "Do you want to document it or are you trying to find a story you can use?"
That scepticism was reported by countless people, usually whites, to come to a society and take advantage of its pain and resistance.
As Folan explained in a recent interview: "We heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson cannot be concentrated, and we decided to do it differently."
Folen had already made contact with the co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist known as the activist of death row inmates.
His participation warmed Ferrell to the project, followed by the six other locals, as well as the following years of "Whose Streets?" Brown's shooting.
David said, "This documentary is not someone talking to us or talking to us; it's us talking."
"That's the main thing for me, how to represent these people, because that's how I'm going to be represented."
"The goal is not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, but to show that the move is "not about a Messiah leader, but about the gathering of society," Folan said, while he proved to be the most obvious of movie participants.
As a result, "Who's The Streets?" is surprisingly documenting the personal aspects of Ferrell's life, as he fell in love and married his wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell, laughing at his first view of the finished product.
"But when I was doing this and humanizing black people, I knew there might be some sensitivity."
Ferrell's story also solidifies and restores the role of black gay women in the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who developed the slogan #Black LivesMatter after the murder of black young Trayvon Martin in 2012, describe themselves as homosexuals.
"The black gay women in the leadership generally kept the movement going," Ferrell said, "and that's because we're constantly at war on many fronts.
Black gay women have to carry all the weight of this."
He added: "The movement is really being kept alive by black women and many gay black women."
Ferrell, however, insists that "this is nothing in the form of the action that is killing," and that he was not chosen because of his identity.
He says, "He was the one who activated this energy."
"But it's not a coincidence that she's on the front lines, because as a black gay woman, there's a lot to lose by living a life in these intersections.
You can feel his energy on the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson are long gone, but the alarming racial connections between society and the police continue.
Ferrell is on probation for another two and a half years for shutting down the highway during a demonstration.
The socio-political atmosphere in what he calls home is what he calls "complicated."
Still, he's got the song he carved into his memory three years ago when he was on the streets of Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our job to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Kyrie Irving: The world is not round, it's flat!
To NBC Sports, Irving said, "The world is not round."
The world is flat.
They make people get used to these things by giving them fear.
Oh, man, don't ask too much.
Because the more you figure out, the more information comes out.
This is crazy.
Is the world flat?
Or is it going round and round?
I think you should look into it.
I'm telling you, they're lying to our faces.
They're lying to us!
Irving said, "I've believed in what I wanted to believe for years."
I thought the world was round and round.
Do you really think we're back in the solar system?
Nothing they send back is coming back.
He's not coming back!
The information they gave us is inconsistencies.
Here's the truth.
You just have to look for the truth.
"Do you understand what I'm saying?" he said.
Kyrie Irving, who claims the world is flat, is fighting 24.4 points and 5.9 assist averages for the Cleveland cavaliers this season.
The artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits.
In the middle of the room at the New York Fridman Gallery, there are many faces hanging from wires on the ceiling, white, black and brown, each of which is almost vaguely similar.
These 30 portraits were created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg, who was sent to her by Chelsea Manning, with ear sticks and cut hair.
As it is known, after leaking classified diplomatic messages through WikiLeaks website, a 35-year-old intelligence analyst, Manning, sent his hair cut from Fort Leavenworth prison.
The new exhibition opened on August 2nd is called a proper likeness.
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines his discipline with his expertise in technology, computer science and art, and a trans-woman pardoned by Barack Obama, and Manning, a leading opponent.
Dewey-Hagborg, who created 30 portraits by analyzing the DNA from Manning and using what a person with this gene data might look like, not only did DNA data have many ways to process it, but also revealed its identity with a firm, maybe a bit of a cerebral interpretation.
In 2013, Manning was convicted of 20 counts of computer fraud and theft from the Espionage Act, six of whom were born Bradley Edward but clearly identified as a woman at puberty.
His image was pressured by the prison, so that there was only one photograph: a sandy black and white selfie with a platinum-yellow wig in which Manning was apparently nervous, sitting in the driver's seat.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was successful in his 2012 project, with a huge splash of Stranger Intuitions.
To draw a picture of what these people might look like, the artist produced portraits by filtering DNA from the scraps of forensic pieces, such as cigarette butts and chewing gum.
That's when he got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were doing an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained in a press preview of the new exhibition.
Meanwhile, there was no visit, no photo taken, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she was interested in making a DNA portrait.
The artist and his imprisoned inspiration became unexpected pen pals by exchange of letters over two years.
They've even uncovered a comic book, an illustration by Shoili Lawgo, where the president pardons Chelsea's punishment and she sees the exhibition personally, a comic book of repressed images.
The fact that Obama really wanted Manning released a few days after the book came out was a happy coincidence, after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas.
While Donald Trump is finding new, tweetable ways to further fuel the sharp divisions that have been asked to wage war against government leakers and transgender soldiers, there is something profound and powerful about this exhibition that is now being opened.
When asked about the strange timing of all this, Dewey-Hagborg said, "The events take place for a reason."
An artist's statement written on the wall of the gallery, including Manning's huge-sized signature (the point of the "i" in his last name was set with a heart), calling for an end to "auto-discrimination based on gender, race, sex and culture."
There's his mitochondrial DNA sequence across the wall: lots of C's, G's and A's written in pencils.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's sophistication dictionary), Dewey Hagborg meant that we all, at least biologically, resemble each other.
"What I hope people will get out of this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how much the genetic data is open to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, who was doing video work in 2007.
"DNA data can tell many different stories, and that's 30 of them."
The last piece in the exhibition held in one room is a page from the short comic book mentioned earlier.
Here's Manning, King Kong style, coming out of the United States Disciplinary Barracks with a hand speaker.
It says, "When they shut you up, they win."
"Don't ever shut up in circles."
"This came directly from a letter he wrote me," said the artist from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibit in person yet (as the comic book is so predictablely imagined), but when he sees it, he will be greeted by masks of his own genetic imitations gathered in the middle of the room like a group of protesters.
Like everything else in the exhibition, the genetic haplogrups were specifically made up to Manning's height (5"2, Manning's height), written in pencil.
"I used to put them on the wall in the past, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said about portraits.
"I wanted it to be perceived as a collective movement shaped by Chelsea, as well as the movement behind her liberation."
Northwestern education officer and Oxford University employee Wanted for Murder
Police say a nationwide manhunt has been launched for a Northwestern University educator and Oxford University employee, wanted as a suspect, after a man was found stabbed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
Cook administration records show arrest warrants for first-degree murder Monday without bail for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for alleged involvement in the murder of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
Documents say Cornell-Duranleau (26) died after being stabbed several times.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said a body was found on July 27th.
Officers received a call, reached Grand Plaza Apartments, and found the victim with several deep cuts on his body.
Official sources say Cornell-Duranleau was reported dead at the scene, and police are investigating the stabbing as a murder while actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been a professor at Northwestern University in microbiology and immunology since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of university relations, said in an e-mail that Lathem was on administrative leave and was forbidden from entering the campuses of Northwestern University.
"This is a criminal case under investigation by the necessary authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior finance assistant at Oxford University.
"We are in contact with the United Kingdom police and are ready to help them in any way they need US investigative authorities," a spokesman from the University and Somerville University said in an e-mail.
The statement also said Warren's colleagues were in shock and wanted him to surrender.
Chief of Communications Anthony Guglielmi of the Chicago Police Department said he strongly encouraged the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, but our efforts to identify him are concentrated," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities helped find suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a mysterious tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the crime scene as terrifying.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether it was July 27th.
He said the security cameras confirmed Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe the victim was having an affair with the student member Latham," Guglielmi said.
The management staff at Grand Plaza issued a statement to residents saying: "Police are still working on the victim's timeline and background and are investigating a series of opinions, possibly a domestic incident."
Italy has seized the German ship
Italian police announced yesterday that the ship Iuventa, which was involved in the search-and-rescue activities of asylum seekers in the Middle Mediterranean, was seized on Lampedusa Island.
He also shared records of phone calls he claimed belonged to two members of the organisation and announced that the operation was carried out as part of an investigation launched by the Trapani Prosecutor's Office in October 2016.
Jugend Rettet members, who have been suggested to have also been operating in favour of illegal immigration on the Libyan-Italy line, have brought refugees directly from human traffickers' boats to Italy, at least three times.
Jugend Rettet, who has been questioned by the prosecutor's office, is also alleged to have committed the crime along with some members of the Libyan Coast Guard.
The organisation then indicated that its priorities would continue to save human life, and they were considering the charges against it.
The Italian Coast Guard and the European Union (EU) mission also serve as ships, as well as about nine international NGOs in the Mediterranean for the search-and-rescue rescue of asylum seekers.
The Italian government has drawn up a 13-point document for the compliance of these organisations and has conditioned it to be signed.
Breaking news: Banlı's five buffets have been sealed
After the attack on Eskişehir Metropolitan Mayor Yilmaz Bükerşen, five buffets rented by retired police officer Mahfuz Banlı from TCDD have been sealed by Tepeböbaşı Municipality.
According to Haberturk's report, a large number of police and riot squads accompanied the municipal teams.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "In the short term, we will complete the WADA road map"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) criteria for the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to be operational again.
"A specific phase has been completed in meeting the road map criteria, Russia has earned the right to plan and test in co-operation with the UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping).
The WADA road map was updated in this context," Mutko said Thursday.
The prime minister was considering the second part of the WADA Rules Compliance Road Map, which has recently been published on the institution's website, describing the criteria for the refunctioning of RUSADA.
According to Mutko, it doesn't contain anything to worry Russia.
"Everything has been announced, it will all be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and the WADA in the near future," he added.
However, a criterion on the list states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the state-sponsored doping investigation conducted by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, approved by WADA.
"Our anti-doping system accepts a failure, and we are conducting the investigation, " Mutko said, referring to the issue.
All measures have been carried out.
But there's no government program, and we're not going to accept anything that doesn't exist."
Mutko's words repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to the Russian broadcaster RSport earlier today, Smirnov acknowledged past problems with Russian anti-doping organs, but added: "We said that the report contains positions and regulations that create opposition.
No one is considering accepting the report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was suspended by WADA in November 2005 for drug control within Russia following the doping scandal.
However, under international experts and under the supervision of the United Kingdom's Anti-Doping (ICAD), this June test was allowed to plan and coordinate.
In July, after a visit to the institution's headquarters in Moscow, WADA Director Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA "was moving in the right direction" in order to become operational again.
100 million people have seen it!
The video, "Come to Beşiktaş," which Beşiktaş announced about the Negredo transfer, quickly reached 100 million people from 18 countries.
The video, decorated by the dialogues of Quaresma, Pepe and Negredo, was also posted on the websites of important newspapers such as Marca, L'Equipe, La Gazatta dello Sport.
The President of Galatasaray does not return empty-handed.
The former head of Galatasaray, Faruk Süren, strongly criticised Dursun Uzbek, who went to Bucharest and the capital for the transfer of Ndiaye to Ankara to convince Mircea Lucescu.
Here are the legendary president's special statements for the SABAH readers:
Lucescu-Ezbek interview: "We were done when we left."
The President of Galatasaray won't go for nothing, and he won't come back empty-handed.
Ndiaye transfer: The president of Galatasaray does not go to football.
The football player comes to the president's feet.
Of course they do, whether she kisses her hand or hugs her...
But no matter who the player is, the president doesn't go to his feet.
You're giving 9 million euros to the player that Osmanlıspor got for 300,000 euros...
It's not going to be 7.5 million, it's going to be 9 million with bonuses!
You've already invested a lot, of course you will, and it's going to be 7.5, 9...
Uzbek's actions: I don't want to be critical.
But it's obvious.
G.Saray readings are eroding.
It's not just football, it's all wrong.
It is the Council and the General Assembly that will change that.
But I understand the members are satisfied!
Start-ups to help your company not become the next Uber.
Amy Errett wanted to measure her employee happiness at e-commerce start-up, but the polls weren't working.
The answers were often vague, unhelpful, or worse, deceptive.
Even though he was committed to anonymity, some employees didn't trust the process.
Errett, who manages Madison Reed, an e-trade company of 75 on hair care in San Francisco, says, "He's never had a record or an objective."
So he called in some outside help.
A new kind of human resources start-up to help companies understand how their employees feel.
These allow companies to produce software, which is the specific purpose of measuring employees' busyness, to license it, to conduct quick-op polls, to target specific teams and demographic groups, to provide anonymous and complaint aid lines to employees, and in some cases by bypassing top executives and by going directly to the board of directors, to allow employees to be allowed to declare a disparity.
"There are vehicles now monitoring your health, such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is your company's Fitbit?" said Redwood City's starting-up partner and president, Jim Barnett, measuring the busyness of employees by companies.
Errett says he understands better what his employees think and feel three years later using Glint.
In addition to providing quick polls and options polls to specific teams, he offers a heat map with a review of which parts of the company receive the most complaints and which manager has low ratings, so that their reasons can be tampered with.
In order not to become the next Uber, companies are beginning to understand that they need to know about the culture of their workplace; Uber has been in a scandal since he described a harassment environment where those who openly say what they think of a blog published by an ex-employee.
For starting-ups like Glint, this request for supervision means a very lucrative business opportunity.
According to the financial technology insights website Let's Talk Payments, the global management, regulation and compatibility industry could be worth $118.7 billion by 2020.
The interest and activity of Denver's Colorado-based start-up Connercent, which helped companies identify and prevent bad behavior, has increased among the debates of Uber's discreditation earlier this year.
Convercent has over 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to conduct personalized "plague" polls, collect real-time secret responses, and map the temperature of troubled areas.
It also offers an anonymous helpline where employees report bad behavior.
If the president is charged, the complaints go directly to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Covercent, said, "The public court has taken over the regulators."
Quinlan said: "If a company does not treat its employees badly or ethically, even if the regulators do not step in, consumer boycotts may face costly consequences due to working casualties or lawsuits.
The restaurant chain, which has over 25,000 employees in 500 positions, has been using the Convercent for more than a year to help its employees know the principles and procedures and provide an easy way to access the company's headquarters.
When a former employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find a phone number or an e-mail from the company headquarters, make an official complaint and hope to be taken seriously.
James Vittorio, chief counsel for Ruby Tuesday, said these are often intimidating and disturbing experiences, and there is no good way to follow up on employee complaints.
But with the company's use of Connercent, problems that have previously been hidden from executives living at office, city or state distances (such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage application) can be identified and solved faster.
Vitrano, who directed Ruby Tuesday's risk management group, said: "I can get even closer to this employment experience from a holistic, 360-degree perspective."
"We also protect our shareholders against business cases."
After the failure of accounting firm Arthur Andersen due to the violation of ethical values due to the Enron scandal in 2002, companies discussed more seriously the issues of ethics, values and relations with the employee in 2002, said Quinlan.
But after "social media regained consciousness," companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from being viral.
"Before technology was used to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and receive repeated fees for the use of their products.
This is a business model and opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors supporting both start-up.
Convercent received $10 million funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February and raised its total capital to $47 million.
Glint paid Bessemer Venture Partners $10 million in November and raised his total funding to $60 million.
These investments are no surprise, given the interconnected natures, cultures, and risk capitals of companies.
The increasing amount of research shows that today's employees expect more from businesses than they used to.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only minimum necessity.
The employees want to feel accepted, valued, and given their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be in a company, they feel their voices are heard and their work is satisfied, they are more sincere to make it a success," said Nina McQueen, vice president of the global benefits and employee experience of LinkedIn, who uses Convercent and Glint.
Investors make a profit when their own portfolios do a good job; companies do a good job if their employees are sincere and feel like they belong to the company.
If the third party analysis tools promise to increase employees' sincerity and feelings of belonging, it's no wonder they have support.
It's important for workplace culture experts to have data on employee loyalty.
But the data is useless if the people in charge of the company don't act.
In fact, if a company wants feedback from its employees, it can create a expectation that change is coming.
And if the expectation doesn't come fast enough, or doesn't come at all, it can cause disappointment and make the employees feel like they've been cut off.
"If you want 4,000 proposals, you need to be ready to talk," said Russell Raath, a consultant at the business management firm Kotter International, who saw that companies had made the mistake of trusting too much data collection.
"Because if you don't follow, the staff will think, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who conducted monthly polls, was able to act on the same day when a problem was reported in Glint.
And after collecting feedback from employees who were tired of the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he managed to reorganise various teams within the company and added communication training to solve problems.
In Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights about its employees, and in the long run, it hopes that it will become able to hire more workers in this kind of industry, which is known to be a high number of employees' entrances.
Vitrona said, "If you are not dependent on creating a culture of transparency, you will lose people."
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you lose companies."
It's a long day for Bruins when the NCAA lifts two practice sessions every day.
It's almost 11 o'clock at night, and a group of UCLA football players hang out to chat on the side of the new training ground in the campus.
Some peel off their jerseys and expose their backs, slippery by sweat from the first day of training camp.
For an important part of the team, these free minutes are a mid-day break.
After three hours of training, registered summer classes will return to their dorms and study for final exams before returning to Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 the next morning.
Just before the Bruins coach Jim Mora returned to Tuesday, he said: "The next three days are a torment for these men."
The NCAA, organised to lift the burden of players, has actually extended its days until at least Friday's finals are over.
That's why UCLA's first three training sessions were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m., which was already adaptable to the players' tight schedule.
In return for no two practices per day, more than once a day, Bruins advanced the start of the camp nearly a week from last season, and for the first time during the summer school year, Mora is training at summer school during the six seasons in Westwood.
They plan to practice 18 years until August 20th, before they begin their official game preparations for their opening against the Texas A&M in September.
Mora said the NCAA supports the change in rules, even though he added new pencils to the players' busy schedule.
Mora said: "We're putting a huge burden on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging."
"And they passed through it recently; they're working, great kids.
I think we'll have more time when we get to Saturday, and it'll be really great."
UCLA will stop their training when the camp is over; it's not easy when you think the luxury hotel Luskin Center is lying in the line of sight of the fields, which is showered by the parking lot next to it and the football next door, and closed behind the fort with a protective net.
The Bruins players are scheduled to move into the hotel from the beginning of this week, but Mora admits there may be a problem with these rooms being empty during the season.
"We'll have security," Mora said.
"It's a real concern, and it's not so crazy to think that someone's gonna rent a room and sit there and videotape a training session.
If there's a video of a practice, that's a pretty good thing.
But we'll have security there, and we'll have security upstairs in the parking lot at 8:00.
We'll do our best with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan."
Facebook enhances story verification power to fight false news
Facebook's third party will send more potential fake articles to the storytellers, and it will show their findings under the original share; the world's largest online social network has explained on Thursday that it is trying to combat what is called false news.
The firm said in a statement on its website that they would use updated machine learning to identify possible frauds and send them to story verifyers, and potentially show the story confirmation results under the original article.
Facebook is criticised for being one of the main distribution points of news reports that many think has affected the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem also became a major political headline in Europe if French voters supported the plan to fine the French voters in May if they were to flood false news before the presidential election and failed to quickly remove hate-filled posts to the social media networks before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate German statement that a test of the new story-confirmation feature is being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing what stories have been discussed by the third party storytellers, people want more resources about what they read and shared to make decisions based on knowledge," Facebook news stream product manager Sara Su said in a blog.
Facebook will continue to test its "interested article" feature and will work on other changes in the news stream to reduce false news.
Comic novel creation: The story of a castle in England
In his recent past, the tiny Scotney Castle was part of a Squeeze music video and became a refuge for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But right now, Scotney, who inspired a comic book written by a Yorkshire man Jamie Rhodes, who had broom hair and a passion for historical documents, witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent.
"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says in a sad way.
"How personal it is to hold this letter in my hand."
A castle in England from the Edward era to the Middle Ages documentes families living in Scotney to be painted by a different artist named Isaac Lenkiewicz (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg).
This is not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: He also wrote "The Teeth of Dead Men and Other Stories" in 2014, a project inspired by stories in the British Library, which he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I even had tears in my eyes for a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the fans of King James," he says.
"That was his thumb print!
And the letters always smell of work because back then you lit a fire for the light.
For someone 300 years in the future, that smell feels like he's there.
Oh, I love archives!"
As a lover of old papers, it seems too good to get support from the National Trust and the British Art Council and stay in a castle for nearly four months ("I'm a little over the top of my welcome, if I'm being honest.")
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, scanning archives, and working on many treasures and antiques, such as hyena heads and bottles that had spent centuries on the walls of the mansion.
Talked to rangers, gardeners, and sometimes artists working on the illustrations of his book, he traveled through the old castle's lands and ruins.
And then at night, he'd go, "He'd drink whiskey and write."
Since the National Trust was only able to reach full access when Elizabeth Hussey, the last heir, died in 2006, Scotney's detailed history is relatively unknown.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff had only begun to look at the archive, which he described as "100 years of aristocrats saying, 'Oh, throw him in the attic'."
The journals, letters from the days of the British empire, maps that determine the limits of who has what: "You think that the disputes in the land will be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a quiche tree over which the two families fought.
Forget it, guys!"
Some stories in the collection, including The Labourer, who left the newly built fort to join the peasant rebellion in 1381, use the castle as a stepping stone to make a wider entrance to British history.
"This book, Knight Families of Kent and Sussex, has a record of riots in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The Village Rebellion began around here, and I thought a rebellion might be a good place to start.
Maybe these two are connected?"
Other stories are closely linked to the history of the castle, such as The Priest, the story of the Darrell family that hid a Jesuit priest for seven years during British Islam.
Or The Smuggler (an exposé of years after his coffin was removed from the ground), including Arthut Darrell, an 18th-century smuggler who was thought to have filled a coffin with stones and staged his own funeral.
The Darrells were Rhodes' favorite Scotney family: "These gentlemen seemed to be quite devious, always in debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men solved debt crises by marrying rich older women; I imagine them as a group of handsome men capable of courting female heirs."
Rhodes, who finished his post at the castle, is searching for other singular writing experiences.
In the Finnish wildlife, he completed a two-week work for a comic book about Elämänmäki, who had been repossessed by nature since the early 20th century.
But Scotney keeps a separate place in his heart.
He says, "I was sorry to leave."
"It's like, 'Oh, now I have to go and face his fucking real life.'"
'Maho' reaction to Coral Akşener
Ismet Bünataman, Secretary-General of the National Movement Party, has made a written statement on the recent claims of resignations in social media and media about the MHP.
Using social media and "some of the old muskets from the corner of Marxists" as saying that the MHP was "but flowing," he said, "the move was applied to games and countertops to prevent its existence under the MHP roof after 12 September."
The great man said:
"The history of the Turkish nation can't digest the existence of the Turkish nation, the Turk can't attract his homeland, so his record is broken, his criminal file is thick, his opinion is blurry, his mind is confused, he rubs his hands if he has any."
"Now that they have left, 410 members of the MHP Kopeli Lakeluk District Service and members have resigned in Yenişehir district of MHP Bursa."
250 resignations, 300 resignations, and the public is misled by unsubstantiated news.
In the columns of newspapers, lies have become huge, deception has deepened.
As we have not received a resignation in this issue, the number of trustees in the places mentioned is not passed by the fingers of one hand.
He described the resignations as "so-called," saying the polls he called "so-called" again tried to mislead public opinion and manage perception.
"Their propaganda and campaigns towards creating perceptions against the MPP will backfire," he said.
MHP is an important and indispensable actor in Turkish politics, MHP Secretary General Grandataman said as far as resignations go.
The ancient Marxists can't afford to destroy the Turkish nation's conscience.
A dirty account lies behind the methods of perceptual management of all comments.
Because politics and media have set their sights on the MHP base.
It doesn't make any sense for us to have those who don't do any good work and work for our party to resign now that they're among us.
What happened to those who couldn't take advantage of our party on their own account?
In their lives, they have not done any good to the MHP, they have not shared our memories, they have not understood our intentions, they have not participated in our struggle, they have always stood on the sidelines, their mental state charred, their heart stoned, the mob must find other occupations.
The efforts of those who are unable to attract the unity and integrity of the National Movement Party are futile in their search for dissension, debate, and rallying.
And he'll definitely turn around and shoot the owner.
The Nationalist Movement is the Turkish nation's last standing bastion despite heavy destruction.
"The nationalist movement is not unclaimed," he said in his statement, saying, "political counterfeiters," "political snatchers" for those he claims to be targeting the MPHP.
"The root that feeds from beyond the ocean, the outer altars inside, no matter what the cost, will not reach their goal," he said.
Using the expression "damaged traitors will go mad and burn in a conflict fire," the MHP's Grandataman said in his statement, placing opposition parties and terrorist organizations together: "From CHP to HDP; from there to the Perinçekgils to the PKK, from PKK to AKP, no one will be able to operate on the Turkish nation's right to have its own destiny."
Yesterday, we resisted the new tactics and games of the planners of Turkey without Turkesh," without the DP, and we fought to the end with the bastards who wanted the government without the MHP, the Parliament without the MHP.
Now we're gonna mess up the games, we're gonna mess up the players.
"The patent of membership is in the MHP," he said, referring to Coral Akşener. "It is obvious that, as in an old Yeşem film called Banker Bilo, I will take the Maho villagers to Germany, as he drove them for days in a truck vault, as he left them on a mountain slope of Istanbul, that he would leave you by the edge of the cliff, saying, "I'm taking you to power," he said.
It's their business, but all we ask of these trustees is that they be the new ones where they're going.
Kjaer signed Seville
Kjaer, who transferred from the yellow-lacivert team to Seville at 12.5 million euros, signed the official contract, the most expensive transfer of the Spanish team to defense.
The Danish star will wear the number four jersey in Seville.
A greater ease than THY for families with babies
The national airline continues to develop ideas for an excellent travel experience, according to the THY Press Advisory, which lays the comfort and satisfaction of its passengers ahead of schedule.
In this direction, the baby travel kit, which was prepared to study the needs of babies and families between the ages of 0 and 2, has been presented to baby passengers traveling across continents since August.
The kit, prepared with a specially designed bag, includes a diaper cover, disposable food apron, rash cream, baby lotion and shampoo, newborn wet cotton wipes and breast pads.
Paraben, products that don't contain alcohol, dye and harmful chemicals, were produced based on the sensitivity of baby skin.
Washington, Green Card Changes Rules
According to media reports, President Donald Trump said there will be a new US immigration plan that changes Green Card rules.
It envisions reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules for temporary work permits and restrictions on visas for the family.
The new rules were proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president.
The draft law will be discussed on both sides of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the United States gives Green Card to other citizens of the country.
The law will reduce the chain migration and replace the current regime.
This new application process will benefit the English-speaking candidates, those with sufficient financial resources and skills to help our economy," the American media quoted Trump as saying.
Authors comment on Fenerbahçe-Sturm Graz
For the past two seasons, there had been joy and glory that I hadn't found, that I hadn't seen, that Kadiköy...
A "mangal-hearted" team that Aykut Big pulled out in the absence was in the field to make the "stand behind us" deal with his fan.
We can bring criticism to your play, positions or performances, but I haven't seen a game that works and calls like this in a long time.
He made it clear in the first game, but yesterday he put his own epaulettes on his shoulder; now Valbuena, the commander of Fenerbahce's field.
The age of the transfer had been a problem, but Big's words had the phrase "unrelenting character."
30 years ago, we gave the name of the atomic ant to Reza Çalmambay.
It would be the most appropriate comment for the French player if he could handle it.
He'd be all over the field, and he'd join all the rust organizations, and he'd take responsibility, and he'd score a goal, and he'd put on a big, short show.
Alper's lead in the second forward position left the Sturm Graz team "resistant" in the field for a long time.
As Fenerbahçe closed the circuit without a corner, the winner kept searching for formulas to break through such a harsh wall.
They control the ball, but they can't produce effective rust in the field of rival punishment.
This image may bring a "I need a centrofoam" comment, but we're dealing with a game that hesitates to pass to Ahmethan, unable to put his only centrphore into position.
Either the team didn't trust the young player or their performance needs to improve.
After the score was 1-1, they didn't get two clear opportunities.
It was important for them to pass the tour, but it would make the night even better to have this fan standing up and clapping for the players' struggle.
There'll probably be a couple more transfers by Monday.
But the truth is Fenerbahce's biggest need is number 12...
We're on the verge of a very bright and enjoyable season with this game that carries the hearts of those who try to play in the front of the bleachers.
Aykut Big's machine is drying up, and he needs more time.
They're in good physical condition.
The quality of the game will also improve.
And you can see very clearly that all the football players in the field have increased their self-esteem.
They really need last night's applause for a new page.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we need to worry.
Just when you think 2017 can't get any weirder, there's a new report on technological developments in the sex robot industry.
Yeah.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Executive Robotics Association (FRR) has published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and founder of the FRR, we should take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eye, the shape of his nipple and the type of fingernail.
Regarding the publication of the new report, Mr. Sharkey said: "People laugh at them, but companies actually move them a lot, and we'll see more of them."
Modern sex dolls evolved into robots that had silicon skin, which was warm to touch with their inflatable counterparts, particularly human responses by artificial intelligence.
Users can also personalize their robots by choosing anything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipple and the type of nail or color of the fingernail to match their own blood.
But with a lot of robots with "persons" enough to make a Stepford Woman look innovative, it's even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls evolved into silicon-skin robots.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to personalize their own robots based on character traits that they find attractive (e.g. shyness).
Then there are Roxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Company, with pre-programming personalities, with the appearance of "Frigid Farrah" and "Wild Wendy."
True Company's website is booming: "Roxxy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as much as possible."
I mean, he loves whatever you love, whatever you don't love, etcetera.
And like real people, they have moods during the day.
He can be sleepy, he can be willing to talk, or he can be in full mode.
There are many disturbing aspects of the rise of sex robots -- not just the replace of real human relationships, but the highly obedient female personality traits, the most suggestive of sexual associations as they approach Frijit Farah.
On the Web site, True Company compares Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If she can have a vibrator, why can't she have a Roxxxy?"
However, these sex robots are not just fetishes or sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to the desire of sex, an optional attachment.
Many men will naturally not have sex robots, and while the FRR points out their growing popularity, they are now in the outer layers of consumer culture.
But leaks can be highly instructive about the course of our time.
A lot of people aren't weird or aggressive until the free market gives them the right to be.
It's not a coincidence that there's a president in the White House who boasts of sexual assault on women, and that these sophisticated sex robots show up at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide.
The creepy thing about The Handmaid's Tale TV series is that not all the details, not all the pictures, not the carved bodies or the carved eyes, but how realistic the image feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a sudden change, but at the moment, it does not feel like such a big change.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create as many physical similarities as possible to real women (of course, in the proportions of porn stars) as possible.
Their creators want them to feel human when they touch them and imitate the movements of a real body.
But when it comes to their "personality," robots clearly don't represent real women.
They can't leave their wives or leave them.
There's no activity, no history, no independence, nothing to break the fantasy of total slavery.
In other words, they're pleasure slaves.
Or as they say in 2017: concubines.
Attacking the American military convoy: dead and wounded...
Foreign military forces operating in the country were targeted during a suicide attack in Karabağ district of Kabul, Afghanistan.
Five of the wounded were the American soldiers in the convoy and one of them were the interpreters working with NATO forces.
NATO support forces in Afghanistan (Resolute Support) officially said NATO forces detonated the homemade explosive during a joint patrol with the Afghan National Army.
The injured personnel have been declared under treatment at Bagram Airport American Military Hospital.
There is no life-threatening threat to the wounded.
Local media say the suicide bomber is a member of the Taliban.
Trump's great skill?
Making Mitt Romney look like a man of common sense
The reality of the Trump era was that the political division that polarized the U.S. voters divided families on a microscale.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the United States were filled with how to deal with the nightmare of relatives who voted for Trump.
We're all supposed to be trying to blow up our own filtering bubbles.
Less talk about it is Trump's power to bring families together.
I'm referring to this because my cousin, who lives in Chicago and is a left-handed poet who has a bad relationship with the Republicans in our family, is visiting us in New York this week.
He reminded me that a merger against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone he's known, including his Republican brother, who's been arguing about politics for decades, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
Well, that's a good thing, of course, at the dinner table, but it seems to me that in a broad context, it's a significant risk.
The left has been revived by Trump, but the bending effect of his presidency has created the force to push to the right for all of me.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we're talking about the terrible possibility that one day his strange behavior might no longer shock.
In fact, there's a more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who defy their standards, and all of a sudden they seem to represent logic.
I find myself experiencing nostalgia for the bizarre version of Mitt Romney's madness: the dog on the roof of the car, a 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like), which are both very light crimes, according to Trump.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate just needs to be in his right mind to be assessed for his insurmountable progress.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the merry-go-round in Central Park, the biggest carousel run by the New York Parks Department, and the best three bucks you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
Horses are hugely large, fiberglass designs in the central cylinder (all the clowns and animals who make strange faces turn to look with fear behind their shoulders) and the music that rattles is incredibly exciting.
In other words, many stereotypes of a city can be disappointing: the views of high buildings become boring, the horizon becomes too familiar to create too much excitement, and the reality of the city doesn't reach the dream.
It's been 35 years, and I still haven't been able to get over the day when I discovered that Swiss Cottage wasn't really a Swiss country house, but a large roundabout in North London.
However, the merry-go-round in Central Park is still an oddly magical experience, so two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and two women in their 40s can go here and have a great time.
If I could grade him on the merry-go-round, I'd give him a full grade, but thank God no one asked.
On the other hand, I've been asked to evaluate the transaction "test" between 1 and 5 stars this week before I pass my credit card in a market.
It's the same thing at the coffee shop on the corner of my street, and the option to match the note to a 15% tip for what was purchased on the counter...
The effect of this is not only that it slows down what needs to be an objective transaction, but it also forces the server to create a persona on a case that has no need at all.
I gave him five stars of my experience of handing him credit cards while the poor woman in the store stood there grinning like she was apologizing.
They wore bathing suits after the temperature was 41 degrees.
In Tucson, one of the hottest days of the season, the people flocked to the beaches of Munzur.
As the heat cooled down at noon, the young, old, old, women and men who entered the beaches near Munzur Tea tried to keep cool in the icy waters to protect themselves from the heat.
The beaches at the edge of Munzur Tea were flooded, especially because citizens of Tunisia who live in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France and England spent their vacations in their homeland instead of in the Aegean or the Mediterranean.
"I didn't want to spend my vacation in the west, to cool off in Munzur as a family, to stay on our own land," Suna Tosun, one of the coolers at Munzur Beach, said, adding that she was taking advantage of the western provinces instead of the western provinces for the holiday.
"The ice-cold water of Munzur is nowhere in the world, at these temperatures Munzur cools us down."
Hasan Ulul, who came from Germany, said they preferred the coast of Munzur Tea in Tunceli instead of the fountains or the basement beaches, and they did not regret it.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital with chest pains.
This is the second time Pistorius has left prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital to treat the cuts on his wrists, which he said occurred after the prison officials fell in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors to the previous accidental manslaughter verdict.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day of 2013, Steenkamp was killed in his home in Pretoria by firing repeatedly at the door of a toilet stall.
Pistorius claimed to have mistaken his girlfriend for someone who was hiding in the cabin for an intruder at night.
Prosecutors said they intend to appeal again against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which they thought was too light this time.
The National Prosecution Mercii said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be evaluated this year.
Pistorius, if the prosecutors succeed, he will face a sentence of 15 years.
There's no death penalty in South Africa.
The first pilgrimage caravan was sent off.
With the organisation of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the pilgrims to go to Saudi Arabia were sent off with prayers and tears at the Ataturk Airport International Terminali.
About 200 pilgrim candidates, as well as relatives and citizens, attended the ceremony at the Outline Terminal ahead of the first pilgrimage caravan's movement.
Turkish Airlines (THY), on the other hand, handed out wild roses to pilgrim candidates on a chartered plane to holy ground.
The Hajj caravan in Ankara was sent off from Esanboğa.
This year's first event included martyrs and veterans who took advantage of the practice of "the hajj for veterans and martyrs."
Two Bulgarians Arrested in Greece for Illegal Camping
According to the State Department's statement and BTV, two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece on the grounds of illegal camping.
A group of illegal campers, including the two Bulgarians, were arrested by police in Sithania on the morning of August 1st.
They were released on the same day as the investigation was already under way.
The foreign ministry told BTV that Bulgarians were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened their control over free camping and are still giving serious punishments to those caught resting in places that have not been set aside for that purpose.
Controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could issue a fine.
We're not going back to Holland until we find him.
JOEY Hoffman (22) went to Turkey to travel with two friends in early July.
Joey Hoffman, on his way to Adana and Mersin in a rental car, disappeared on July 8th in Silifke.
The friends he came with couldn't reach Hoffman despite all the calls, so he notified his family in Holland.
While the police were on the move to find the missing tourist, their brother Robin Hoffman and his friends, Angelo Durei, went to Jaimy Gewald Adana.
THE INVESTIGATION WAS RETURNED
Robin Hoffman, who applied to the police here, published missing persons reports to find his brother and distributed them in Adana and Mersin.
The last time they heard from Robin Hoffman was on July 8th, saying, "We first called the police in Holland."
Later, my two friends and I came to Turkey and applied to the police here.
So far we haven't heard anything, and we haven't found a clue.
"We'll stay in Turkey until we find my brother," he said.
Congratulations from the world's second minister, Ayse Ceren.
At the 2017 Palette Swimming Youth World Championship in Russia, the national athlete Ayşe Ceren Greenbaş won second place in the world over 400 metres of water.
Minister of Youth and Sports Osman Love has congratulated Ayşe Ceren Greenhead, who won the silver medal for his message.
On the first day of the 2017 Pallet Swimming Youth World Championship in Russia, Ceren Greenhead came second in the world over 400 metres of water.
Ceren missed the gold medal with only 27 salises, while taking his place on the second-place bench with a spectacular performance on the track where he competed with eight finalists.
Elena Lopatina of Russia won the gold medal at 400 meters at 03.18.73 minutes, while Ceren won the silver medal at 03.19.00 degrees.
Turkey is represented by eight men and eight women athletes in the championship.
His last words were, "I think I'm dying, goodbye, Mom."
"I don't want to die, Mother, it's not fair."
"Thank you for everything you've done for me, goodbye" by Italian Gloria Trevisan and her lover.
Among the dozens who had not been heard from since the fire were Gloria Trevisan, 26, and her Italian lover Marco Gottardi, who lived on the 23rd floor of the 24-story building.
Maria Cristina Sandri, a lawyer for the Trevisan family in northern Italy, announced that both youths were certain to have lost their lives, according to information from British adults.
Voicing that young people's families are in great pain, the lawyer also asked journalists not to insist on getting an explanation.
I think I'm dying. Bye, Mom.
Lawyer Sandri said Gloria called her mother Emanuela Trevisan on her cell phone shortly after the fire broke out and cried herself when she listened to these last conversations she recorded.
According to this, Gloria Trevisan spoke to her mother several times during the two hours after the fire started around 1:00 local time.
"Mom, something bad is going on here, there's a fire."
We're stuck, we can't get out.
There's some smoke, but don't worry, we're waiting to be rescued.
"We tried to get out by opening the door, but there was too much smoke and the elevator wasn't working."
As the fire grew, Gloria Trevisan's last words were:
Mom, I've seen my whole life flash before my eyes.
I think I'm dying.
I had a life ahead of me, and that's not fair.
I don't want to die, and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I'll never be able to hug you again.
Thank you for everything you've done for me. Bye, Mom.
I'm going to heaven now, and I'm going to help you from there.
It's the Italian government's fault.
Gloria Trevisan and her boyfriend Marco Gottardi, who both studied architecture, had difficulty finding work after graduating last year, moved from the northern Veneto region to London in March.
Gloria Trevisan, who was only able to find a 300-euro job in her country, soon started working in London with £1800 (about 2060 euros) a month.
"Gloria went to London to help her family," attorney Sandri said, saying Gloria Trevisan's family was having a difficult time financially."
Unfortunately, our young people have to leave the country to save their future and find a job.
"The government must find a solution to this problem immediately," he said.
It's the drama of Italy that can't provide work for its young.
Gloria's father, Loris Trevisan, expressed his anger as saying, "This is the fault of our government, which forced our young people to flee abroad to find work."
In Italy, unemployment has reached 12 per cent, while the youth rate has exceeded 40 per cent.
Over the past few years, many Italian youths, especially Britain, have started to emigrate to many European countries.
Just last year, the number of young people who had to leave Italy because of unemployment was over 110,000.
Commenting on the finalisation of the news of Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi's death, Italian media said it was the drama of a country that could not provide work for its young.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can ease the IBH
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare to your digestive system.
However, a new study suggests the opposite: a rich diet of meat-based proteins and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms of people suffering from inflammation of bowel disease.
In the United States, this untreatable health condition affects 1.3 million people and 300,000 people in the United Kingdom is causing stomach cramps and swelling, repeated or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Although patients are often advised to skip meat and dairy products to ease their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that protein's main amino acidic triptofa helps develop immune cells that develop a resistant bowel.
The chief researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells patrol the intestines so that the microbes hiding in the food don't sneak into the body.
The cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that are able to sustain sensitive tissue without harm.
If the balance slips too far towards inflammation, the inflammation can result from intestinal disease.
Experiments have found that a type of immune cell has emerged that promotes endurance in rats carrying a specific bacteria in their intestines.
And the bacteria needs a triptofana, one of the building blocks of protein, to trigger the release of cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We've linked the bacterial Lactobacillus reuteria, which is part of the bowel microbioma, to the development of the cell population, which promotes endurance."
Rats with more triptofan in their diet had more of these immune cells.'
If the same happens to humans, L. said that a rich diet of reuteria and triptofans could develop a more resistant, less inflammatory bowel environment.
Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, a post-doc researcher, was working on some kind of immune cell that developed endurance, and discovered that a group of test rats had these kinds of cells, but another group of people of the same species didn't have this.
He suspected that the difference was related to the rats' bowel microbiomas, in other words, to bacteria, viruses, and fungi communities that normally live in the gastrointestinal canal.
The rats' intestines were sequenced for DNA, and the rats with immune cells had six species of bacteria, but none of which were found to be missing from the rats.
Rats that lack a bowel microbioma and do not develop this kind of immune cell have been given an L. Reuter and immune cells have appeared.
To understand how bacteria affected the immune system, researchers raised the L. Reuteri in liquids, and then passed on a small amount of this bacteria-free liquid to the immature immune cells taken from mice.
Immune cells have become cells that promote endurance.
The active component turned out to be a by-product of the triptophan metabolism known as indol-3-latic acid when it was removed from the liquid.
When researchers doubled the amount of triptofan in rats' food, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when their triptofan levels cut in half, the number of cells fell in half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that humans have cells that encourage the same endurance as mice, and that most of us have L. reuteria in the stomach-to-mouth canal.
The triptophan byproducts from L. Reuteri are not known to develop as well as in mice, but the disorders in the genes associated with triptofane have been found in people with an infected bowel disease.
" It's something we probably want to encourage the development of these cells, " he said, "because these cells control the entrails of the entrails.
Potentially, the high level of triptophan in cases of L. reuteria is causing this population to spread."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United has signed a story with Nemanja Matic.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic after the midfielder played his first match against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million-pound transfer from Chelsea began on Tuesday, ahead of the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid in United's pre-season match, with a 2-1 win in Dublin, and Paul Pogba and Andreas Perseira were in a position to push forward, depending on their taste.
However, Matic, who was left out on the pre-season Asian tour of the Blues, was severely lacking in game conditioning and was only able to take off for 45 minutes; Mourinho admitted that it had to be healed before the Premier season began.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence, his thinking genius... he thinks about football," said Mourinho.
"We'll help him get ready earlier."
Mourinho began to shape the first 11 for the beginning of the season, while new transfers like Matic played at Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku at Aviva Stadium.
The Independent found out this week that Mourinho still wants three more transfers, but the club has already insisted that three of its four priority transfers are "an extraordinary job."
"Thank the club for taking three out of four."
"I'd be happier if they took four out of four, but they made a big effort for me."
Last year, 197 people were sent to the hospital.
According to ISVEC Social Welfare Agency data, the diagnosis of gender dissatisfaction of 1 person per 100,000 in 2005 increased to 8 in 2015.
Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital received a transfer of a majority of children and young 197 who were unhappy with the sex they were born in the past year.
"Openness in the psycho-sexual area, including questions about sexual identity, can be perceived as a general development in society," said Louise Frisen, a child psychiatrist in the same hospital.
Gender dissatisfaction is known to have no connection with sexual orientation.
Drug operation in Izmir
Police Department of Trafficking and Anti-Organistic Crimes teams have launched an operation into the home of 36-year-old F.T. on September 3rd Street.
In the search of the house, 33 ecstasy pills seized a delicate scale.
F.T., who jumped off the balcony and tried to escape, was arrested and taken into custody.
It has been noted that F.T. will be transferred to the courthouse following police procedures.
Transfer at Evkur New Malatyaspor
Evkur New Malatyaspor, a new team member of the Super League, tied the wing player, Turgut Doğan Şahin, who wore the Kasympaşa jersey last season to his colors.
According to a statement from the yellow-black club, the transfer effort signed a two-year contract with 29-year-old wingman.
"The two-year deal was reached with Turgut Doğan Şahin, a wingman in Kassimpaşa.
Good luck with our new Malatyaspor."
The British inventor used a hand gesture to implant a microchip into his home and car.
A British inventor was the first person in the country to wear a microchip so that he could open his front door, access his office, and even run his car with just one hand gesture.
Steven Northam (33) had his tiny chip transplanted between his thumb and his finger, and he now offers it to businesses and people who want to facilitate their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
In order to ensure that the implant procedure can be implemented in medical standards, Winchester collaborated with Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hants.
Technology is similar to the microchip transferred to cats and dogs, and it only lasts 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company will also change the locks on the houses and vehicles, including £300 per lock to match the chip.
The man who's married and fathered a child, both his house and BMW Z4, are stuck with this technology, and his hands are on the wheel, and the vehicle works.
The White House Show cost taxpayers thousands
According to military records released to TIME, the White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the south lawn for an organisation that cited American production last month cost taxpayers a figure of up to $24,000.
When the president got on board, the green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One, was the focus of the organization that introduced American construction programs at the White House on July 17th.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officers have seen products produced in all 50 states.
A helicopter in Connecticut, a yacht in Main, a fire truck in Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
According to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House Military Agency requested the presence of the helicopter only 36 hours before it landed on the southern lawn of the "unexpected" organization (as it is being tried in FRAGO).
The commander of HMX-1 sent an e-mail to his superior Marine Aviation Commander the day before his organization said, "I just wanted to make sure you were aware because this is an unusually high-visibility organization."
The message indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the south lawn around 7 a.m. on the morning of July 17th at 3 p.m. and would remain there until the grass was cleaned between 6 and 9 p.m.
The note added that if exiting the White House was delayed, a second flight would be required for the return flight due to the deadlines.
The original flight crew was in the helicopter during the organization while the unit's security personnel were on the ground, while the aircraft was on the ground.
From the records provided to the TIME, there's no telling if a second flight crew is ultimately necessary.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records show HMX-1 is investigating whether the organization violated that condition.
"A question we asked was whether he violated Hatch's Law and we were told he didn't."
"It looks like you're locked in," said the Deputy Commander.
The "Made in America" organization has been established by the White House as an official organization and is not part of the Hatch Act.
But even formal organizations have political implications.
The head of the organisation then referred to the ongoing efforts of health care reform in the Senate and praised efforts to restrain government regulations.
Using aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new event.
Presidents have to use them to travel.
But it's unusual to be formally asked to use these only for the opportunity to be photographed.
Trump drew attention when the presidential plane moved backstage to Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was full of messages about the use of his predecessor's presidential plane.
"The White House is excited by the 'Made in America' exhibition of products made by American workers of all 50 states," said Lindsay Walters, deputy White House press secretary.
The HMX-1 crew often take training flights in the Washington area and exercise to drop the President of the United States on the south lawn at a point shot at the White House.
When Trump was in Germany for the G-20 summit in July, HMX-1 conducted 58 drill landings at the White House.
One official said the flight for Made in America was considered the air crew's need for training within that month.
Unit helicopters flew 11 hours that day for "support missions that had nothing to do with the presidency."
The White House said taxpayers didn't charge for any other number involved in the organisation.
A spokesman from Sikorksky said their firm did not participate in setting the display of the helicopter on the southern lawn.
HMX-1 doesn't keep budget records for presidential flights, and it's hard to determine the exact costs that have been delivered by the organisation.
However, according to the Ministry of Defence's per-hour rates for the fiscal year of 2017, the Ministry of Defence's rate of meeting VH-3D is $24.340 per flight time.
Unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico central base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real operating costs of the helicopter are far below that.
"To tax taxpayers, it is very misleading to make a profit based on estimate of the cost-appropriate rate," Walters said.
"These estimates include the sunken costs involved in personnel, maintenance and annual expenses."
According to a RAND study in 2015, the Defence Ministry's expense rates do not include personnel costs, but it includes fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer advocated the use of the helicopter for this organization.
"The idea is to show what was done here in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security, and I think that even without thousands, hundreds of people's jobs depend on it.
And like most Americans, I think we're all proud of helicopters and other military equipment that many Americans work tirelessly to do.
So it is proper to bring it forward."
It's not clear if Trump interacted with the helicopter while traveling the south lawn for the organization, but he stepped into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump joked with the media about the products of his own fleet and addressed Sikorsky representatives.
The president said, "I know Sikorsky very well." "I have three of them."
President Erdogan's joy of goal

Narcon Season 3 trailer: With Pablo Escobar gone in Netflix' hit series, the Cali Cartel takes the lead
Although Pablo Escobar's killer appeared in season two, Netflix's show doesn't seem to be over.
The third and fourth season has already been confirmed by the online broadcast service, while the first one takes its first trailer and gives it ideas about the bad characters of the next semester.
With season three, the DEA turns its attention to the richest drug trafficker in the world: the Cali Cartel
They're run by four powerful mobsters, and they're run by "like a Fortune 500 company," but with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar), head of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis), directs Mexican connections to Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann), and is based in Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) in New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a character who supports American and Colombian law enforcement in the war against drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
Narcos' third season will be released for the first time on September 1st.
According to the U.N., Afghan democracy depends on women's political role
On Wednesday, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan, he said the elections could represent the role of all parts of society, including women.
Nicholas Haysom, deputy president of the U.N. Assistance Mission, says hundreds of women compete in the province council elections, three women compete for vice president, and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women.
"The roles of women cannot be exaggerated," he said in his statement Wednesday.
Elections can be truly representational and reliable if only women participate fully and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
The Afghan province council and presidential elections will take place on April 5th.
The Taliban threatened the election process, which coincided with the time when international military operations became consulting.
This year's elections point to the peaceful transition of power from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said the strong role of women would contribute to Afghanistan's democratic success.
Afghan Independent Election Commission reports 1.2 million registered women from 3.6 million registered voters.

The GMB concern for McVitie's investment in the Glasgow factory
A union wants assurances from the executives of the biscuit maker McVitie's that long-term commitment to production at his factory in Glasgow.
The company remains silent about the future of investment in the Tollcross region, the GMB said.
In addition to other products, more than 500 people work at the factory, where Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits are produced.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, said they've invested more than £5m in the region over the past few years.
If anything changes in their operations, the employees and union representatives will "be informed first," he added.
In a letter to the company's plant manager, GMB Scotland demanded that McVitie's "resolve the concerns that there is no funding for the modernisation of production tapes."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said: "Our members are deeply concerned that we do not see any clarity in their business needs from the director general and the investment plan for Tollcross' future.
For generations, families work here and are gathered in the local community and in the area of high unemployment and social deprivation, in the critical basis of adequate employment, Glasgow and the suburbs.
In view of work, salary and well-being perspective, Brexit urgently needs a four-headed production at McVitie's east end, against rising conditions, rising living costs and chronic production reduction."
" The plant manager in Tollcross received a letter yesterday from GMB Scotland, and the company will respond directly because we value our commitment to workers and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting in Tollcross two months ago with employees and representatives of the GMB, where a few problems were clearly discussed.
So we explained to our employees that, like all companies that operate in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment, we have been constantly reviewing our operations for all of our jobs and facilities.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross facility, especially in production tapes and operational development.
We are fully aware of Tollcross's legacy as a production facility, and if any changes happen to our operations at the facility, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
Necip and Utku are in Beşiktaş for another four years.
The Beşiktaş Club extended Necip Uysal and Utku Yuvkuran's contract for four years.
Beşiktaş extended a contract with the two players until May 31st, 2021, the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) reported on the website.
Necip, who grew up in the infrastructure of the black-and-white team and made his first professional contract on 19 June 2008, began to play for the A team in the 2009-2010 season.
The 1991-year-old player, who rose to team captainship, played in a total of 254 official matches with Beşiktaş jerseys.
The TFF website also included information that Beşiktaş's contract was signed until May 31, 2021, when Utku Yuvkuran, the goalkeeper he hired last season, was hired.
Utku's information was released from temporary transfer status as of August 1, 2017, and his license was renewed on August 2nd on the website.
Utku Kövoran served at Beşiktaş, where he played for rent last season, mainly in the Under 21st League.
The young goalkeeper served in only two Turkish Cup matches with a black-and-white jersey.
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's departure three years ago?
The La Liga side may have regretted their interest in Marco Verratti.
Did Paris Saint-Germain warn Barcelona of destroying the world record three years ago when he offered Neymar a proposal that triggered the 189 million-pound release clause?
With the Ligue 1 team ready to break the world transfer record for more than twice as much last season as Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in exchange for £89 million, the sensational offer set the summer transfer period.
With PSG offering a salary of £500,000 a week after taxes, the transfer shows that Neymar will be the world's most expensive player and also the most profitable professional athlete.
Although a source close to the Catalans' administration insisted that the club had always done its best to keep an eye on him since his arrival from Santos in 2013, Barcelona was known to be angry about the way it was proposed and the way Neymar tried to leave.
So, was the football world warned by the PSG president about this landscape three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi gave a strong warning to all the clubs who wanted to sign one of PSG's top players.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be against them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, they will suffer the consequences."
The Spanish club Barcelona seems to have crossed that line earlier this summer, expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
The PSG has made it clear that they will not allow the Italian national to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona feels strongly losing its reflections of its greatest values by losing Neymar.
The penalty for stopping reading the raft has been broken
The alleged defendants, Kenan Gülşen and Nait Yilmaz, who had tried to march against İmam Mustafa Baki in Küçükçekmece Gültepe Mosque reading Sela, were alleged to have tried to stop Kenan Gülşen and Nait Yilmaz for "do not knowingly and willingly help the organization" and "resist not to do the duty" and "deceived" crimes in İstanbul 22.
He was tried by the High Criminal Court.
Taking into account the victim's complaint on charges of "insulting the public officer's office" and the way the crime was committed, the court committee, which decided to fine him with 7,000 lira, sentenced the defendant Yilmaz to one year in prison, considering the importance of his mission, which was prevented from doing the victim's work as well as the future of the crime date and time of Turkey, considering the importance of public opinion and the "resist not to impose duty."
The delegation ruled that Yilmaz's prison sentence be reduced to 6,000 lira fines.
After two defendants were sentenced to criminal fines, the defendants' lawyers filed a plea.
İstanbul District Courthouse 23 for review of the case.
He came to the Department of Corrections.
The agency, which completed its investigations, found that the sentence against the defendant Kenan Gülşen was justified in the legal context, that the action had been described as correct and that it had followed the crime type prescribed by the law.
By the High Criminal Court, when the defendant Nait Yilmaz met the imam Mustafa Baki, who came out of the mosque, he said, "You are not putting the people out on the street.
The president has been taken.
"This is over," he said, adding that his attempt to march on him, to strike him, "is determined to "resist in order that the victim imam may not be able to read the persecution and the sala at certain intervals," "to not have the duty done."
Although the grounds have been laid out by the local court, the agency said the action took place when the victim completed the vic's Sela and Ez reading mission and informed the public in front of the mosque, noting that in the concrete event, the victim had not had a job to perform or continue, without a debate as to whether he had committed the attempt to wound the victim due to his public duty, and how the defendant had been judged for insufficient grounds that the victim would be able to control the tasks he would later perform.
The defendant's absence of a criminal record has not been discussed as to whether the victim's physical damage due to the crimes imposed on the accused, while the moral damage does not constitute an obstacle to resuscitation of the verdict and will not be implemented due to the victim's refusal to file a complaint, the agency said.
The agency, which saw the indictments of the defendant's lawyer on these grounds, decided that the verdict on the defendant would be annulled and that the case would be extradited to the first-degree court.
6 Europeans on Interpol's list of live bombs
The German newspaper Die Welt reported that Interpol (International Police Service) sent a list of 173 people with the potential to stage suicide attacks on behalf of the terrorist organisation DEAS to European law enforcement agencies last May.
132 people on the list were reportedly from Iraq, North Africa, Gulf countries, Tajikistan and Bangladesh.
Six people on the list have been identified as European citizens.
They are reportedly from Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Bosnia.
Germany's DEAC contact was reportedly a 27-year-old German citizen from Solingen, North Rhine Vestphalia.
The person reportedly went to Egypt before the fall of 2012, then to Turkey, and finally to Syria.
According to the DEAS social media accounts in mid-July, this person was reported dead in Rakka.
It has been noted that the German Police Department has not answered the newspaper's questions on the matter.
The names on Interpol's list were said to have been seized in operations against the DEA in Mosul.
According to Die Welt, U.S. intelligence sent this list to Interpol.
Interpol also reportedly forwarded the list to police in Europe in May.
According to a report based on German security circles, ISIS could attempt to send part of the names on this list to Europe to organise suicide attacks, Die Welt reported.
Five-year-old Starsu could lose his eye.
In Job, blood flowed in the sendoff of the young ones.
A large group gathered in the park in Karadolap Neighborhood to see their fellow soldiers off the night before.
Allegedly, M.K. and D.A. fired shotguns into the air from time to time.
After the soldier's farewell, the group began to fall apart.
When M.K. passed the playground full of kids, he took a shot at the ground with a shotgun.
One of them sitting on the park bench, five people were injured because of the ricochets.
Those moments were also reflected on the park's security cameras.
The wounded were taken to nearby hospitals in Ferhat Turan, Ercan Turan, Destiny Balkır, Starsu Unus, Pearl Rock ambulances.
Five-year-old Starsu Unus, who has been treated in the hospital, is at risk of losing his left eye.
Starsu's grandmother, Mary Kaya, told HAN about those moments.
"The military celebration began at 8:00 p.m."
It took two hours.
The military entertainment is completely over.
The boys are starting to fall apart.
It would be the same for us to get up when it's over.
That's when the gun went off, right in front of me.
My grandson is not well.
There's an 80-90 percent chance of losing your eye.
We talked to the doctor, that's what he said.
They pulled out one of the craps, and the other one's in his eye.
He said, "He's had an operation, maybe 10 surgeries."
The suspect M.K. and E.A. were arrested and taken into custody by Eyup District Security Directorate Bureau Chiefs.
Two people who were referred to the courthouse after questioning the police were arrested by the court.
