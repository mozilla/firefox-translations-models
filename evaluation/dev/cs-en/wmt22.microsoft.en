The great return of the Czech loser is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The thirty-one-year-old Pilsen native will be on the bench and could soon get into the goal.
The former goaltender of Litvinov, Pilsen and Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
Exactly in the middle of the game with Vegas, he substituted and since then he has not played on NHL rinks.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one stick to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be out for about three to four weeks with a lower-body injury," the Denver-based team announced in early October.
His return to the NHL goal was eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning US time, he was called up from the farm, where he played four games and showed his old form.
He made 94.5% of saves in the AHL.
The Pilsen hockey player wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
He had hip problems last year and missed a single game in the shortened pandemic season.
In the NHL, "Francík" played 36 games, his success rate is 92.3%.
Charles wears a face mask to Camille on her Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas card.
Prince Charles also made his wish public, using a photo of him helping his wife Camille wear a face mask at the races.
The British news station BBC reported on its website.
They send greeting cards to friends, co-workers and foundations they work with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long khaki summer dress and Princess Charlotte also has a dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, like Princes George and Louis, is wearing shorts and a collared T-shirt.
William and Kate have not named who took the photo, nor is it clear exactly when it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed on a straw bale in front of a pile of wood at their Norfolk country estate for a photo intended as a Christmas card.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also released by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at the Ascot races in June.
Charles, who wears a top hat and a face mask, helps Camille put on her mask, colour-matched with her light-coloured dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – Criminalists in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Roman Berbr, was supposed to have been promised one million crowns by Slavia Prague for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The news server efotbal.cz reported that he had obtained part of the police files.
Jaroslav Tvrdík, chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice club, said that the red-and-whites had not committed any corrupt conduct.
The server has published a transcript of police wiretaps in which Slavia mainly includes its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended up at the championship club last summer.
According to the file, the former influential official of the red and white was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the then second-league Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Criminalists allegedly worked with the information that Slavia promised Berbra a financial reward if he won the title.
2019, SK Slavia Praha won the title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) should have a million-dollar bribe from the officials of SK Slavia Prague for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to detectives, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of Slavia Tvrdík.
According to the server, it is not clear from the file whether the police are still looking into this information.
Tvrdík denied any corrupt conduct.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an opponent alternative to its development.
We have never committed any illegal conduct, we have not tried to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this context," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretaps, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former dark-skinned Slavia players and also defames his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing through referees was unleashed in mid-October last year by police intervention in several places, including the Prague headquarters of the FACR.
The highest-ranking person in the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football positions.
In mid-January, like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, Rogoz, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and IFVs are Cold War larping.
The guns will be new, but basically of a worse type (artillerymen must carry shells manually from the armored cabin and without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, moreover, we have already managed to get rid of the Praga V3S even with specialized units.
Aircraft: combat - decent, but at the end of the charter, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we do not have at all (but we produce and export abroad)
Air defense: medium - Cold War, obsolete; short-range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
I have a hunting ground right next to the city.
Nutria were climbing out of the river and doing damage to crops, so I was sitting there.
When I came, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down calmly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I hoped he would leave before he got out, but of course after a while the fox went.
I let her come to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was for a fox.
By the time I got down from the sitting position, it was gone.
I.e. even a meadow can be a mess.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a coincidence of a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen in thermal vision, which almost everyone has today.
So in a visible place, expensive things put at your feet in a sleeping bag and you should be cool.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Interior got respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
Server iRozhlas compared purchases of individual ministries and found that during a single day the amounts for the respirator differed by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why have prices moved so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy more expensive?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks with iRozhlas editor Dominika Kubištová.
I respect soldiers and the army (I am probably not affected by the memories of the ČSLA that older generations went through), but the Czech Republic is not able to benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large warehouses of equipment that trained people could take, we don't actually have modern equipment even for existing professionals, plus modern technology is still more complex, so the skills of reservists will be rapidly lost in time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where they can be deployed, will happen very quickly, there will be no time to train someone again.
Finally, reservists/territorial defense is of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where mass guerrillas can be waged and it is an explicit necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will be waged only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not even have a suitable geography for this.
Mainly, we do not have individual skills.
That's not even the worst of it.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they have it.
Then there is such a situation that you look like a dude who 2 minutes ago did not hit an empty gate, drives into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and you say to yourself "tvl and what do you think will happen now?".
Well, of course, they treat him like the average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill of "catching a defender" is so terrible that I found myself genuinely surprised to see that our attacker was able to outplay one player of the opposing team.
First swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect a major turnaround in the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, the onslaught in hospitals will last for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or post-infectious immunity acquired by previous illness helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side has also entered the Covid equation this week: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug has arrived in the Czech Republic, the antiviral drug molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And it should soon be supplemented by Pfizer's drug paxlovide, which reports an 85 percent success rate from the results so far.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how prepared the administration is for incoming drugs.
As has been said, Merck's molnupiravir will reach domestic patients first.
The company was the first to end up on tape because the drug began to be developed long before the outbreak of the current pandemic with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for viral diseases of horses on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
Eastern Europeans, and especially we Czechs, are used to talking "how our beak grew".
See you do a survey where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most will unceremoniously tell you no.
In the West, they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, to say this in public is to lose their job and be lynched in the media.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they really find out what people are thinking.
Only in France, Le Pen and Zemmour, both have over 20%, according to the survey.
We even know that there are three objects in the Czech Republic and they are completely identical.
Identical because of the rotation of units, so that the soldiers do not have to relearn where everything is, so all objects are the same.
One of them is Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for security reasons or for the speed of deployment of warheads because of its more western location.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple) only warheads were stored, not whole missiles, as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit came to pick up the warhead and mount it on a carrier device.
In addition to the museum maple, the remaining ones are in a desolate state.
At the second grade of elementary school we had a classmate Cigán, we were with him for 4 years.
He was pretty cool, he made good jokes, he often showed himself too much, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone talked to him, he often went and wanted to explain something, he missed little, he went regularly, he did sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he walked cleanly dressed.
He also went to schools in nature, did various monkey shops, but he was fine, perhaps never a mess.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies entered the same year, a different class.
Shortly afterwards, they beat up the teacher, the police often dealt with something, they threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for an advertisement (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had money, they did not try to stretch me on the price, communication calmly.
I even sold a car this way, a guy called a month later that he had already rewritten it on himself ..
I say about myself that I am not a racist, I do not care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or otherwise, as long as he behaves as he should in a decent society (works, works, does not beat women, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes, stretches out his hand, vacates apartments and houses, has only a mess around him, makes trouble ... So it doesn't matter what color it is, but it will bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants, as long as they get involved here, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will be theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash in the Prachatice region
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokeswoman for South Bohemian paramedics, told Pravo.
The crash was probably caused by the driver who was carrying the girl.
The eighteen-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and for reasons that have not yet been determined, he went into the opposite direction in a curve.
After a collision with a Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on the roof off the road, South Bohemian police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová described the accident.
The young driver of the Peugot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
These were multiple injuries and he remained wedged in the car.
After his rescue, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and was airlifted to the hospital in České Budějovice in a stable condition, said paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from non-EU countries, and customers often do not provide information about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys trading cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free," explains the collector.
Since October, ordering small consignments has become slightly more expensive, and he now has to add VAT and hand over customs clearance data to the post office.
He receives an e-mail informing him that customs officers are expecting the package to arrive.
Then just fill in the shipment details, and if the merchant did not include VAT at the time of sale, the customs office will assess it on the total amount for the shipment and for shipping.
If the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the carrier's remuneration must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
However, not all shipments can be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of received shipments from abroad at the international post office in Prague dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech Post, it is also a problem that people do not respond to requests for the data needed to complete customs clearance.
Currently, there are 30,000 shipments at the international post office that we have to process.
If people filled in all the data that is needed and filled them in on time, we would be about halfway here, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Tackling inflation
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and expect it to rise further.
What do you think the state should do to slow or compensate for this growth?
For example, we see a reduction in VAT on food and fuel in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where this is going?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, and I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
For example, how much did you get added (who is an employee)?
This year they added 2% in gross, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business I run while working.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why convicted rapists are sent to prison for only 6 months?
I just don't understand how a court can send such an animal to jail for 6 months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, it will negatively affect his sexual relations and relationships in general.
Not to mention that the rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won't this discourage potential future reports of rape of victims?
A man from the Grave "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlaty
A man from Hrob inadvertently helped officers arrest his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He himself had summoned them to her.
But he took a detour.
First, he approached a passer-by and made up a story that he had been robbed.
After calling the emergency line, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged "robbed" told them that he had invented everything so that the officers would come to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the officers on how to file a report with the Police of the Czech Republic.
Upon checking the identities of the man and his girlfriend, officers discovered that the woman was on a wanted list, a nationwide manhunt, and had an arrest warrant issued.
The case is therefore being handled by the Police of the Czech Republic.
A sincere question for the people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we are no longer Slavs ethnically or culturally, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with the meme, it is a pity that Churchill did not manage to secure the liberation of Prague by the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can really believe something without evidence just because it could potentially bring benefits.
Personally, I would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are an estimate, if I'm not mistaken, about ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should one then choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in any of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
Even in the Ten Commandments it is said that there is no other god than Yahweh.
In such a case, wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than to risk choosing the wrong one of the thousands of gods and the one real god I haven't just hit will send me to hell or some similar place?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in reserves.
I think the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months to one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
Something like this would suit all components of the Army of the Czech Republic.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can talk like this: There is a constant rehash of cooperation between the education sector and industry, companies hunt in schools, and there is a kind of intermingling where the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment.
Not only in adolescence, but this process takes place constantly, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar intersection should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German or even a Mongol invader will never invade again.
I find it funny how you consider NATO to be something set in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there is a breakthrough.
Well, please the lord.
All it takes is one election in the US to cut its budget and the whole of NATO goes to waste.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown themselves once that they just have to show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that works as a guarantor of independence in the long term is the army armed to the teeth and the population that can control the military equipment of its time.
And today, every teenager can pilot remote-controlled vehicles, so what would not be possible.
We don't need border fortifications, it sucks these days, but a scruffy teenager behind the stick of a remote-controlled device can cope.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Do you unwrap presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you are overwhelmed with boxes and fillers at home?
This "waste" is again used by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of shops that will welcome your used boxes was created.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a pity to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (the map of the project KAMsNIM.cz contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overflowing blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the money saved, as packaging carton has increased by 50% in recent years.
In the eyes of eco-conscious customers, I also strengthen my brand.
One such shop is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco drugstore and eco cosmetics.
Boxes and filling material are brought to Popůvky u Brna by individuals who accumulate at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular collection of discarded cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Individuals and companies together create a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only the sampling points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand in expired medicines, tires, retired electronics, batteries, light sources, bulk waste, etc.).
Thus, all garbage can end up in the right place, in addition, reusable things will find their second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100,000 such places.
"Gradually, collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help to find a use for things that would otherwise become waste are being added," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukliďme Česko association.
I rather find it wrong that nowadays the technology is so simple and stupid that children who use a computer or phone play games on it, but do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, a problem has appeared (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple applications for photos, or actually mobile phones in general, simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the application.
Feel free to use the technique from childhood, but mainly let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU presidency – starting in January – over the weekend – and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency's logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many events that they cannot be done in six months.
But French politicians like it that way, and so do voters.
Macron's supporters straddling the right and left agree on little, but they do on Europe.
And in France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The election calendar has also affected the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
Many commentators were quick to criticize that Macron is pursuing pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for the French presidency, Éric Zemmour, is touring France right now with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is quite successful with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea for a history textbook seriously, and let's not look at what is happening in France.
Wouldn't it be needed?
Students in European countries are often taught history as an us versus them story and never as a story as a whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened teacher, they won't know what the broader context of the event was.
Movie of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which harks back to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, also won Best Director and Best Actress awards for Jasna Duricic.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, it was at the top of the audience chart.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for The Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu / being" I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't feel like smoking...
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
With the flu, I don't have diarrhea.

Trains start to run according to the new timetable, somewhere the carriers will change
From Sunday, trains will start to run on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet is starting to operate instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time will be adjusted, or their route will be slightly adjusted.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Carriers started selling tickets during the autumn.
In the new timetable, Czech Railways plans to dispatch an average of 6783 passenger transport connections per day, of which an average of 478 will be long-distance trains per day.
Trains will cover around 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections under the new timetable, the railways will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Along with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main innovation will be InterJet trains, which will run on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be dispatched by the carrier in northern Moravia and western Bohemia.
Starting next year, the carrier will also traditionally increase fares by an average of 3.2 percent.
The railways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry to the R23 line Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
After success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport, the carrier will replace Czech Railways.
A total of 16 connections will be operated daily by RegioJet, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín from Sunday.
Leo Express maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, despite the planned closure works, the carrier also tried to keep the travel times of its long-distance trains as similar as possible.
The operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue without major changes.
The carrier will also change on some regional routes.
Changes await passengers, for example, in the Českolipsko region, where Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run instead of Czech Railways on the line from Mladá Boleslav through Česká Lípa to Rumburk.
For the second year, passengers will also be able to benefit from a uniform rail fare.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Aren't we learning the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to toil, how they died.
I have never heard teaching from the point of view of the slave party or from that time, no one is advocating this, only condemning it.
No one will tell you in schools that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves, and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one will teach you in school that colonizers often bought land from Indians, everywhere they will just tell you how brutally we Europeans murdered them, while murdering each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, right in schools, both in more northern schools and in southern schools.
I have not encountered anyone deliberately suppressing the facts, but I have heard before that it is happening and in my opinion it is a problem, I do not deny that (for example, in Japan, the atrocities of WW2 are quite taboo).
Rather, my point was that history is not black and white, and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History is not interested in anyone's feelings, it is simply what it is, and I think it is a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at things from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never do this again.
By the way, speaking of Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slavers are quite popular there, but on the other hand, they also had some good successes and it seemed absurd to me to dismiss them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people idealize it these days.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in the South was slave owners and they resented a lot of things.
I would not compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, moreover, our view does not exist with them (there was also a video from TV on YT where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous about American schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I found it appalling at some universities, the students were quite radicalized, and the schools supported them many times.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, I feel a little sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because among the young there is and in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism, for example, has long since achieved what it should have and it is no longer about the same, it has become radicalized.
Nowadays, feminists are labeled by those who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological facts, as well as other groups such as LGBT and it leads to radicalization on the other side, where it often leads to resistance even for quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I have not encountered anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
Rather, I encountered bad geography, but that was a mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality in general to be unnecessary from the point of view of any personal identity.
If anything connects me to people, it is interests, views of the world and common experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not religious, but from what I know I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a very nice guy, he preaches more about theology than politics, but then he always gets some cocktail about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernism and are de facto Catholic without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they go to Hussite services because it's theologically very similar, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the church of sv. St. Michael's Church in Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and they even do Mass in Latin every Sunday at 15:00, as it was done before the Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the scouts did not go to Vienna for it this time, they took it over from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal – Břeclav border crossing in the morning.
They took it over at the border last year as well.
The Light of Bethlehem is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year, I look forward to it very much.
"It is an honour for me to have been chosen," scout Amálie Budíková told the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal – Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, however, scouts go by train to Vienna for him.
Nothing has changed in the distribution of flames in the Czech Republic.
With the light of Bethlehem, the scouts traditionally set off by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
On Saturday, December 18, Scout couriers will take care of the subsequent distribution of light, traveling on selected express trains and passenger trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take the light from them at the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame in the Czech Republic and where the tracks do not lead.
Even this year, the Scouts must comply with the applicable measures against the spread of coronavirus.
It is similar to last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to of course wear masks, try to keep distance, there were as few of them as possible, do not sing colleagues, just behave in such a way as to make it as safe as possible, said Zuzana Hrbková, spokeswoman for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of the light of Bethlehem that travels through Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace along with the flame.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Guides have been taking care of its dissemination for more than 30 years.
The event is based on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human mutuality.
All the news, including a list of places where people can come for a flame, can be found on the www.betlemskesvetlo.cz website.
I don't have an economics degree, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education will put the money to good use, but I do not understand why this money is given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - it produces an unnecessary product and disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million "xy financed/co-financed by project xy" signs in the corridors and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not supporting a company that gives work to x number of people, this is a brake on the development when this company is holding on and taking orders/employees away from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
Totally agreed, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the Internet age also falls into a trick or trap - especially advertising.
I myself think that internet ads will not move me, but then I still catch that they have influenced me - it's just so worked out that you can't always resist it.
For this reason, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament that currently want to ban programmatic (= targeted) advertising altogether...
It's all rubbish, in the words of the classic - I would ban the Internet.
My feeling is that this belief has its roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe something that the majority believes and that makes sense, I am not a sheep after all, but I prefer to believe something that is less likely, it does not make much sense, but it is important that I have my own original opinion, which I will claim is cover thinking"
2. "I won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Televisions have fallen for the trend of Christmas films, two hundred of them have premiered this year
Los Angeles – Movie theaters, TV stations, and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen for the trend of Christmas movies, and this year they will premiere a record more than two hundred of them.
It was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring with audiences in recent years and significantly increasing viewership, which is why more and more of these films are being made.
This year, four times as many Christmas films were made as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database has included only those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so realistically there will be many more holiday movies.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are mainly associated with this period, and films such as Home Alone, Love Heaven and the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
But the real boom of Christmas movies started in 2009, when the American cable television station Hallmark came up with a special film series.
Her Advent project, Countdown to Christmas, included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station began tuning in to its viewers for Christmas on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Rival Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on the schedule this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the total.
"In this magical time, the story doesn't matter so much, the important thing is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it is snowing," said Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
"For the audience, it's a form of escape and a way to feel a little peace for at least two hours in the midst of all the festive madness and madness of the world we've been living in for the last couple of years," Gray said.
Hallmark Television, for example, uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding, which is successfully resolved and the two kiss.
It's like this over and over again, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after the other," Gray adds.
Mazepin tested positive for covid-19 and will not play in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will compete in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for covid-19 and will not play in the last race of the season.
Haas will send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack a better position from 20th place, which he drove in qualifying.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin of Haas will not be involved in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the grid, Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher will start from the last place, Max Verstappen from the first, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
Mazepin is relatively fine, according to Haas, and shows no symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow guidance from the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all parties involved," its representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not and cannot send a replacement driver to the race.
Any substitute would have to complete qualifying or rides in a different part of the weekend.
The first competitor is not dealing with COVID-19.
At the start of the just ending season, Kimi Räikkönen had covid-19, last year Sergio Perez or Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
You can be arrested for this, too.
And everyone will be by the boss saying.
In terms of the law, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
That is, in the same group as HIV, plague, jaundice or typhoid.
Section 152 Spread of a contagious human disease
(1) Whoever intentionally causes or increases the risk of the introduction or spread of a contagious disease in humans shall be punished by imprisonment for six months to three years, disqualification or forfeiture of property.
(2) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for two to eight years:
c) if such an act violates an important obligation arising from his employment, profession, position or function or imposed on him by law, or
d) if such an act causes serious harm to health.
(3) An offender shall be punished by imprisonment for three to ten years if he causes serious bodily harm to at least two persons or death by an act referred to in paragraph 1.
(4) An offender shall be punished by a prison sentence of five to twelve years if he causes the death of at least two persons by an act referred to in paragraph 1.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters were never worn much in our home," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his work in six months.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France, and 2,000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
He then decorated the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
"The base is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater softness," the creator praises his work, which, however, he does not recommend washing.
And there is another catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
So far, the most expensive sweater, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 crowns.

The government approved the dispatch of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Engineers, scouts and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, with the mission approved for six months.
They are supposed to help Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially asked for help from NATO states in connection with the months-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already stationed on Polish territory.
Omikron mutation spreads in South Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
"We currently have another suspicion of this variant reported in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov Elementary School is not proven," Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the county in a week.
"We are still waiting for official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the National Institute of Public Health in Prague," said the director.
She added that there are two nurses from one workplace of the University Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old pupils of the Adamov Primary School.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
According to the director, three of them have mild symptoms, four have an asymptomatic course.
No one with the suspicion of Omikron traveled abroad
None of them travelled abroad, nor did any of their families, nor did they have contact with anyone abroad.
There is no connection to the water polo championship in any of them, Ciupek said.
Chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová said earlier that an international water polo tournament that took place in Brno a few weeks ago is being examined.

California will restrict gun sales.
He wants to do Texas to ban abortion.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced plans to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the nation's most populous state, using a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions performed after an embryo's heartbeat has been detected.
People would then be entitled to compensation from anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement was in response to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling Friday that upheld the Texas abortion ban, albeit in defiance of a nearly 50-year-old precedential ruling that established abortion rights across the U.S. until about 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the Court was now ruling not on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative construction of the measure.
The enforcement of the ban in this case was made public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual judicial channels.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday) decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to maintain Texas' ban on most abortion services and largely support Texas' maneuver to protect its law," the California governor said.
"If states can now block review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use that power to protect human lives," Newsom continued.
He said he instructed his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the justice minister on a measure that would authorize members of the public to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and that can be used to circumvent regulations are labeled.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to claim at least $10,000 in damages and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes, or sells assault rifles, "ghost weapon parts" or kits in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should be doing," the California governor said.
California has banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to renew the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court member Sonia Sotomayor, who warned against extending the legal mechanism to other US states in a dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant the Texas abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue suing selected officials in the southern state.
Each emergency vaccination has its public testing phase, where it is gradually figured out what the vaccination schedule will look like and the vaccines themselves are also improved, based on the results.
For example, from Israel is already rolling in a large study on the effects of 4 doses.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Simply like any other vaccination, it will have its vaccination schedule after some time, but it is still too early.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on inactivated virus should soon come to the market, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10 times greater efficacy.

I think O2 offers the Champions League, but I don't want to change TV and Internet providers.
Poland threatens to suspend payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting illegally if it used its new powers to stop disbursing money to Poland because of a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of Poland's €36 billion plan to draw €36 billion from the EU's recovery fund for economies hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism to take EU subsidies away from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this EU blackmail with a veto on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its slim majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which are leading to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justified given that the EU is illegally denying us funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes a more radical stance on EU accession than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary underwent during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels is building "impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing "political diktat carried out by blackmail and attempts to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro said.
He said Poland should be a member of the EU, which is based on a partnership of sovereign states, and not on a government of the strongest and a Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never accept such concessions to Brussels that would limit Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony," he said.
But to make sense of it... Here at Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for other things, I met one yogurt more than once, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector there were all selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between vegetables and lactose-free zones...
If there is avoidance, I will not even smell to any market, action or action, a golden shop on the square, they may not have such a selection, but they usually have everything I need and it has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a holiday.
And I don't care anymore.
For two years, I've been watching how data is treated like manure here, most anti-vaccine opponents are just a little more off the mark than most vaccine advocates.
Rational discussion takes place at the professional level, but only extreme opinions enter the public space.

Binary thinking: vaccination saves us, vaccination is useless.
Disable everything, allow everything.

Wow, so I was relieved.
Sorry for the outburst and have a nice day to all of you.
In my childhood they punished me with a wooden spoon.
It was never because of grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was naughty (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mom always threatened first that if I did it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after another "catch" the spoon just brought it and placed it so that I could see it).
It wasn't until I repeatedly refused to listen that I received a few blows on the butt (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that corporal punishment (in reasonable execution and extent) is beneficial because the child responds to it much more than to words.
I think the part with the warning is important, because it gives the child a choice, in a way, whether to disobey and get, or to improve and not to be punished.
In the end, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
System Defense
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech constitution meant to him – whether a sacred charter on which one swears and learns from childhood at school, or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he was definitely inclined to the first concept.
Once we agreed in the Constitution on democratic rules of our lives, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to save them with changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl commented on the question.
Recently, however, there has been an increasing opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not foresee, for example with the behavior of a directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be premeditated.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, and only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies throughout history have faced.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of governance consisting of individual rules that set the limits of the game for politicians.
We are afraid that power will be used against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians with bans.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not choose, in the University Hospital Brno they are fighting for the life of a several-month-old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder to children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been struggling with especially recently.
"We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, we talk about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head physician of the Department of Paediatric Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation at the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, told Novinky.
The course is much simpler, lighter, often proceeds without symptoms.
However, there are child patients who are seriously ill with coronavirus, which we have seen especially recently," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It takes place in the clinic of pediatric infectious diseases.
Indeed, very seriously ill children with coronavirus have only recently been on ARU.
According to the doctor, children with post-covid syndromes were in the department continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia, which requires a stay in a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that the disease affects both adolescents and babies several months old in addition to adults.
There are also children in serious condition due to coronavirus in hospitals.
"Currently, we have a child of several months of age and adolescent age," said the head physician.
However, he is pleased that no child deaths from coronavirus have been recorded at the Children's Hospital of the University Hospital Brno so far.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, in a children's hospital – not only in the coronavirus ward – it is an integral part of the cooperation of a psychologist.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that as in adults, vaccination alleviates the course of the disease in children and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
"Therefore, we recommend the application of the vaccination dose even in children," the doctor added.
In the quiet zone you can only walk on marked paths.
But the quiet zones are not that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on the mapy.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the rest zone you can walk anywhere (but do not climb over the fence to the game park).
Skiing/cycling in the woods outside the marked paths is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so much guarded outside the national parks).
How does a conductor practice?
Music is in my head, laughs Josef Kurfiřt.
He was educated by the Liberec opera and originally played the French horn.
As a singer he can sing practically all the repertoire and as a conductor he works not only in the F. Šalda Theatre in Liberec, but also in Pilsen, in the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
He cooperates with the Hradec Králové Philharmonic Orchestra, the Film Philharmonic Orchestra and the Podkrkonoše Symphony Orchestra.
China is building the impression of containment and that the authoritarian regime is coping better with the crisis
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building the impression of a controlled contagion and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has embarked on a health and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing deflected criticism for failing to contain a contagion that has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero increase in infections.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are often helping to fight the coronavirus, for example in the worst-affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says, "Hey, don't you want an elephant?"
I have it and it's great.
The wife is glad because she grazes the grass, washes the car with her trunk, the children play with it.
Simply great.
If you want to sell you an elephant for 5000,- I will sell it to you.
Friend: yes, I'll slap myself, that's going to be great...
After some time they meet and the one who bought it complains: dude, what did you sell for an elephant????
The lawn is trampled underfoot, huge shit everywhere, the car is broken, the children are afraid of it, and the wife wants to get divorced.
The one who sold says: you talk badly about an elephant, you can't sell an elephant like that...
World affairs are dominated by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that set the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a power if it works towards its integration.
So far, it works at the economic and political level (in selected issues), but military integration is still missing.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalisation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century the mood will be different and it will be done.
It occurred to me too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert on Czech, so maybe I'm vocabulary.
I'm just assuming that an ellipse usually includes 2 different units at the same level.
To borrow an example from another commentary on 'Spanish oranges and tangerines', where it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas in the case of 'Spanish fruit and tangerine' it is no longer clear that tangerines are from Spain.
Moreover, I base it on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces", including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect it's already included in the broad term, and there is no need to further specify it for U.S. forces.
But again, if only with words :D
Be that as it may, it is a nonsensical request

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured Milly the marmoset monkey
Horrific footage shows the moment a terrified monkey crouched in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it and laughed at it.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs and burgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
Gwent Magistrates' Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun reported.
Experts in monkey rehabilitation who care for Milly after her abuse said they had never seen such a terrified marmoset before.
Milly spent almost two years rehabilitating the staff of Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The mother of four pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At Gwent Magistrates' Court, she was given a twelve-week prison sentence suspended for one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, given a lifetime ban on keeping animals and must pay the equivalent of 12,000 crowns in court costs.
Steph Sawyer, head of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, said: "Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is happy with the male, the sight of new people can still cause her to panic.
The psychological scars of abuse will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's abuse came to light after police in Gwent discovered horrific footage on the woman's phone after a raid on her apartment on drug charges.
In the footage, Milly can be heard cursing vulgarly.
In another video, Holland can be heard offering cocaine to the monkey and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox, 43, pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with the intention of selling it.
In her house, cocaine worth 1600 pounds (equivalent to less than 50 thousand crowns) was found hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months, and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from prehistory three times in a row if you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like you're going to get the same things in your freshman year as you did in sixth grade?
And the whole thing is killed by the idea of cramming, where no one, honor to the exceptions, cares if you can or understand it.
Mainly write a test for 1 and then no one cares.
Go and randomly ask people on the street if they can determine the character of the roots of quadratic equations and coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the absolute majority won't even make a dent and tell you they're absolutely in.
So what the fuck is it taught for?
I'm a big fan of general overview, and the reality is that people don't want and don't have a need.
And at that point, it's useless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
Part of it is taught for the many people who will need that particular thing.
But like, the remark that you really don't need all this to stand by the machine, I meant absolutely seriously... ... because you just don't need to.
Moreover, we are slowly getting to a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(This is probably due to our communist past and incitement against the educated and elites) However, the price of having barbarians standing by our machines is simply high.
For example, if journalists could count, covid would probably never have reached these proportions here.
Wedding at first sight: Kadri and Andrea's war continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right away," Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to curious questions from curious fans about what disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social networks.
Things had been creaking between Kadri and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move to join her, at least until he returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! Kadri was immediately upset in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling, and debt.
The alleged honesty of Kadri's now ex-wife did not sit well with his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally, I don't comment on things like that, and even in my family we never said those things to each other.
I certainly don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone who is trying to publicly hurt and tarnish the name of someone I love so much, they just won't give it to me!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it the most, despite his young age.
The more I regret when I have to read such false information, which is probably quite taken out of context.
"I wish everyone knew Kadri as well as me, our loved ones and family," the confession reads in response to Andrea's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and we know the reality and we know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The drunken thief climbed the façade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Cao began his robbery in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
Then he couldn't think of anything better than to climb to the 5th floor and climb into the apartment through the open window.
There he stole two bananas.
Footage from one of the security cameras shows him walking down the street away from the crime scene, eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
She subsequently detained Cao.
The man admitted to drinking some alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, in a drunken state he decided to rob.
The matter is still under investigation.
The drunkard climbed the façade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Act is time-limited and has its effectiveness tied to pandemic emergencies.
If it is repealed, the law will not be effective.

Is that not enough for you?
The right of assembly will be limited, but not abolished.
More than 60 percent of voters turned out for Saturday's elections to the councils of four municipalities
People elected new councils on Saturday in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and in Rovné in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities fell below the statutory number or the councils elected here were disbanded.
On Saturday, 99 candidates ran for a total of 28 seats.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a rather demanding but successful year for us.
A total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place there, ČSÚ Vice-President Eva Krumpová said.
She recalled that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and staffing.
In Komeň in the Uherské Hradiště region, the Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday's elections, winning 27.76 percent of the vote and two mandates in the seven-member assembly.
The STAN list received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means a gain of two seats.
Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the assembly, with 18.52 % of voters voting for them.
The current mayor of the municipality, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Privateers, also got into the assembly again.
The Komňané – independent candidates – won one seat in the assembly.
75.48 percent of eligible voters went to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in the Pelhřimov region, the association Pro Rovné won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, four seats out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were elected to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
Repeated elections in Lusatia in the Most region were again won by the Association of Lusatia and Svinčice led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It won 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member assembly.
The second place went to the Municipality for the People list, which received 43.27 percent of the vote, so it will have three representatives in the assembly.
76.7 percent of voters went to the polls.
The elections in Nová Ves in the Liberec region were won by independent candidates of Hope for Nová Ves ahead of the ANO movement.
59.88 percent of voters voted for the Association of Independent Candidates, giving them four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the vote and has strengthened compared to the regular elections in 2018, gaining one more mandate and having three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
On Monday, the results of the election will be discussed by the State Election Commission.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you know everything that people write to you here.
You're just playing stupid to have someone to "argue" with.
If not, that's sad.
I'm not saying Christians are degenerate, or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the goal to make them look good, after all).
And I don't really care who believes what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much power the Church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it raised, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it caused, like the Thirty Years' War
Tl;dr: believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell upside down from twelve meters.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
An unbelievable fall was survived on Sunday night by a man in Ostrava who was intervened by rescuers of the regional Emergency Medical Service.
Staff of the regional operations center received an hour after midnight on Saturday with emergency calls with initial information about the fall of a man from a height.
Two EMS crews – medical and medical, immediately went to the scene.
Upon arrival at the scene, the paramedics found that a twenty-seven-year-old man had fallen from a window from a height of about twelve meters and hit his head on the concrete!
In Vítkovice caught coal.
But not as it should, and the firefighters went into action.
By the time emergency teams arrived, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of death.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial lung ventilation and after other measures within the pre-hospital emergency care, an ambulance transported him to further care of the Ostrava Trauma Center, informed the spokesman of the EMS MS region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried about the inadequate reactions of the public and the authorities than about the coronavirus
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and medical staff are primarily on the front line of the fight against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask military doctor David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira defends belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
Things happened at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peño managed to defeat legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who had not found a conqueror for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate at featherweight, he showed great strangulation against Dustin Poirier and defended his belt.
Kai Kara-France also scored the victory, quickly sweeping Cody Garbrandt by technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also beat his opponent.
A surprise that no one expected.
This brought a women's bantamweight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the battle as an imaginary "dwarf", as Nunes had not lost for seven years and was grinding her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the quest for victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick that sent her to the ground.
Peñova, however, did not allow herself to be forced into any further mistakes and unsuccessfully tried to attack herself with a lever on her hand.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents had a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
Peña also got Nunes to the ground, where she began strangling her.
She had to give up the effort and tap the attack.
The American prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the featherweight title.
Initially, Poirier fared better, but gradually the tables began to turn.
In the second, Oliveira tried to be more active, trying to beat his opponent with a lever on his hand.
He did not succeed very well, but then he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and showered him with a number of blows.
As a result, he won the second round.
On the third lap, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to knock the choke away.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley scored a sovereign triumph, putting on Raulian Paiva in the first round with a hard right back.
He then beat it with a series of precisely aimed blows and scored his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her young daughter, but now she lost after seven years.
That hip or that hip?
At first glance, this is nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so it is not a problem to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or neuter.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns in which the gender is not settled.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When declension, they acquire two endings and in some cases remain in a non-inflected form.
For example, the words "trouble" or "hip" are masculine and feminine, in the former they are inflected according to the pattern "machine", in the second according to the pattern "song".
For another group of nouns, there are already different forms in the first case of the singular, for example: "line/line", "kohlrabi/kohlrabi" or "potato/potato" (meaning food).
Both forms are standard, have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example "cucumber" in Bohemia and "cucumber" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is non-standard, as are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "ditch" and "ditch", "donut" and "doughnut", etc.
Some words that penetrated into Czech from other languages were originally non-inflected, but they gradually adopt Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which remained uninflected in the middle gender, but has endings in the masculine one according to the pattern "castle".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like right at the Greek border?
There are tensions at the Greek-Turkish border over the growing number of migrants trying to reach Europe.
Thousands of people began to travel to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians promise support to Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to make an uncertain journey?
And what does the situation look like on the ground?
We didn't see blue skies for three months and we were suffocating, says a journalist from Sydney
The devastating fires, now in its fourth month, have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and the inhabitants themselves coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent drastic repercussions, as critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in relation to climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to Sydney journalist Ika Detrichová.
False accusations have always been rare enough.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It's uncomfortable for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to book it.
I don't know anyone personally who has been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've experienced how those people are often treated by those around them or even by the police.
The victim should always be believed.
The trend has become that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
But still too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "much of the accusation is fabricated" and that it's a "trend," you're only helping rapists.
The Czech Republic is flooded with houses under construction, families have no money to finish
Prices of building materials have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
This has put many people in a difficult situation.
It does not have the funds to complete the family houses under construction and banks refuse to increase its mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the cost of construction work is also increasing.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete already unfinished family houses.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people move to unfinished and unapproved houses.
In the worst case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and pay rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two or three family houses a year, and fifty percent of them have happened.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult in that we have to keep some things contractually, even though the material has become more expensive.
So we work without earnings," said the owner of the construction company, Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are yet to have financial problems.
If they expected the house to cost them five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait," Slivon added.
Of the materials, copper, iron, as well as plumbing and heating equipment became the most expensive.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
There is a shortage of construction graduates in the Czech Republic and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by the pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of building permits is more favourable.
"Building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," Křeček said.
We are doing well and we will be even better.
But real visions are missing, says Czech Radio commentator – mujRozhlas
In addition to the classic celebrations, the entry into the new year was traditionally accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to Prime Minister and ANO Chairman Andrej Babiš and President Miloš Zeman's Christmas message, the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also addressed the nation.
What fundamental lessons have we learned?
As in this, I find the diploma great, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I follow up on the bachelor's degree, I always work on it for a whole year and then in a week or two I write a written part.
State exams are completely calm in our country, if a person is not a total macaque and something remains in his head, the commission will not unnecessarily stifle him on theory.
For example, I studied for the state exams for a week, and when I was at the end, the committee always tried to lead me to some logical derivation, which I immediately understood and I had it right.
As for those projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we've done it a lot of times, really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
In my opinion, it is great when there is an exam at the end of the course that reflects the knowledge gained in the project, not just the defense.
Everything ok, but don't overload your e-mails and phones, and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be as much of a dick as they are.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can build a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe even put it in such a way that he touches Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta throws obstacles in the way of artists.
Once you don't give stories every day and at least a new image every other day, your reach will be reduced to the bare minimum.
In addition, it constantly changes what function is more important, whether like, comment or save.
It's been bugging me lately, so I may have to stoop to tiktok, where a lot of artists in my industry have success and they almost swear by it.
In the end, I might even like to see something more user-friendly that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of artists
Statement by the Donbas Workers' Party
The Union – yes, break-up – no, the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal dismantling of the USSR.
On the eighth of December 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind took place.
In the Bialowieza Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal powers and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open benevolent attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "the SSR League as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With one stroke of a pen, they "abolished" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the beginning of the nineties, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Despite the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who, in one session in the Białowieża Forest, destroyed what had been built in the previous seventy years betrayed the socialist camp (created by the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously deindustrialized, put the brakes on agriculture, and separated from the world's largest power fourteen republics that had previously been economically united in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of Orange Revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the East, the war and the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, the surrender first of the socialist camp, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as a "vacuum of power".
Everything that was hastily betrayed and given up was quickly filled and conquered by the NATO countries, which accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken to this day, mainly because of the events of the late eighties and early nineties of the last century.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I buy it and put it in the fridge and make it into dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality in which I do not buy the meat on Monday, on Tuesday the chain will reduce it to 99 CZK / kg - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat becomes a burden on my digestive system by changing its price?
Or I wait until Thursday and the meat will be 1 day before the use-by date discounted to 69 CZK / kg - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday 120 CZK more expensive and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I will answer myself - with nothing.
This about the fact that if something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or of poor quality is terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Now recently I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies were handing out some brochure, I always take similar things to help the temporary workers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but nothing about god anywhere, I was confused, but I suspected that it would be some kind of agitation.
After reading it, I found out who published it and eventually Scientology came out of it.
Well, like it was a good matrosh, full of completely useless precepts, like I should wash and not be a pičus.
Too bad for the paper, because of this the rainforests would not have to be cut down.
I experienced something similar with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to please the person because you love them without realizing how f*ing the situation is.
She threatened me several times that she would hurt herself because I went out to chat with a friend she didn't like.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she cried and begged me on her knees not to go anywhere.
Then she began to physically block the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another half a year passed and she started to suck.
Then I ended the relationship, telling her I was breaking up and lying to her, but that we could talk about it next week to calm her down and not get some amok.
Such a person will suck your feelings, emotions and overall joy out of you.
Better keep your distance
When insurance companies are furiously stealing by buying a cloud of tests and hunting down positive people who would not even know about this terrible disease if they were not tested.
All we are achieving is complications for companies, carriers and others due to the fact that their employees in the random number generator were placed under house arrest for five days.
In the West, they have stopped the antics and recognized that there is no point in dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and has to steal something and fuel his ego by inventing bullying.
I see that the good old junk is coming back again.
After several years of decline and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruitment returns to the limelight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman at university), the initial promises of product training and business skills quickly turned into "you don't have to care, just get people".
I was honestly interested in the products I offer, because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about scaring and talking.
When the first money came, one quickly realized that if one wanted to earn, one had to whip up a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, so you felt like a door-to-door seller of pots.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, one learned not to jump on every bacon and thoroughly check the information.
At the same time, I would not lump them all together.
There are people successful in this business and even beneficial to people, but they certainly will not boast about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" account.
I haven't experienced many things like that in the corporate where I work.
HR is calm, managers mind their own management and do not poke our noses too much.
Regular evaluation is somehow happening, in the form in which it goes in our country it is quite possible (set some goals for the next year, in a year we will see what came out and what did not) - it is more of a self-assessment than that someone would evaluate you according to some numbers, and so on.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes one has the feeling that we are such an almost-start-up that squats in the offices of a large corporation well.
But it works so they don't bother us much as long as the results are there.
A Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, British police have searched to no avail for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the resigned Minister of Foreign Affairs Jakub Kulhánek announced on social networks that a woman from Uherské Hradiště had been found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed to our embassy in London this afternoon that they had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is under investigation.
Out of respect for the family, we will not be revealing more information about the case.
Sincere condolences, Kulhánek said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on November 28 on a bus on her way home from work, and she was supposed to pick up money from an ATM before boarding.
Her disappearance was reported by colleagues from work five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began to search for her, Interpol listed her among the missing around the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police detained one man in connection a few days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what she suspects him of, but did not disclose.
At the end of the year, four municipalities were given new councils
On Saturday, December 11, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities fell below the statutory number or the councils elected here were disbanded.
There were 99 valid candidates for 28 seats in the new elections.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men won seats.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
A total of 13 lists of candidates were registered for new municipal elections in the four municipalities.
There were 36 women and 63 men for the 28 representative posts.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a rather demanding but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated elections to municipal councils took place there and, above all, the highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
We mostly had to work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and staffing, said Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last constituency was processed on Sunday, December 12, at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and, once approved, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
Coming to terms with the fact that we have a quite dangerous contagious disease took me a while at the very beginning, but it went without any major hitches.
To come to terms with how idiotic a large part of the population at all its strata is about it, I still have a problem with it.
I'm most looking forward to getting vaccinated (tomorrow!) because it will finally make me less dependent on other people not being.
He would be stripped of his presidency and eligible to regain it.
The chances of this actually happening are, however, as others have mentioned here, very small.
Moreover, I am not sure that shredding the file could even be considered treason.
High treason is an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who are without sex for a whole year is increasing
More and more young adults in the U.S. are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious people, according to the DailyMail's website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who give up sex rose from eight to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who said they had not had sex in the past year are more numerous than ever before.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed.
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of media, social networks and video games, which make sex a smaller and smaller priority for young people, could also have contributed.
"Since 2010, there has been a rapid increase in the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who report not having sex in the previous year," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Married people are more likely to have sex, with only 5% reporting in 2021 that they had been without sex in the past year.
For single people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriages under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious disposition also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married under the age of 35 continues to decline.
Young people are divided about premarital sex, with about 30% thinking it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It's true that they are a minority among single individuals in this age group, but their behavior is shifting that trend," Stone says of those thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious background.
Since 2008, the abstinence rate has increased from 20% to almost 60% for single people under the age of 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month.
Among 'less believers,' the trend has risen from 10% to 20%," Stone said.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and, more importantly, social drinking during the pandemic, are also contributing to the decline in sexual activity.
The study also showed that people without work or on lower incomes are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, making up for this need.
This trend has caught on mainly during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole covid vaccination mandate is about whether society should force a part of the population to behave that they don't want, but that can save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, on which I am personally most interested in the question of social conscience.
That is, for example, the question of whether if we do not order them to do so and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be responsible for the death of an eighty-year-old person who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it to him well, heard some misinformation, and as a result he didn't get vaccinated, and in the end he caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we are responsible for the death of a stubborn opponent of vaccination who, alongside the SPD and the Communist Party, shouts something about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I have mentioned, it is quite clear that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the latter group, so they will really be responsible for it themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How will a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter has so far brought one of the smallest snowfalls in the Czech Republic in recent times.
Ski resort operators cannot do without technical snow, the weather complicates the preparation of the Jizerská fifty cross-country skiing.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I would have one story, but it is not about the gentleman.
Once in high school, the teacher took us across town to the shipyard so we could take a boat ride on the river.
On the way there, we walked along one quite wide street and who we probably don't see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they fell on us.
Fortunately, I escaped, but he and one of my friends started talking.
When she left them, the teacher and I asked her what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I didn't have a soul," she replied.
Everyone, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We are terribly spoiled.
Not so much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovich
After previous visits to Paris and Brussels, Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where he was greeted with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in our relationship," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must make it clear together that it will not accept a violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis, caused by worrying movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border, should be resolved using diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the "Normandy Group" of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader, Alexander Lukashenko, has artificially provoked the migrant crisis and is using people as living targets and weapons, as night after night we record hundreds of attempts to (illegally) cross the border.
He discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by Lukashenko's regime.
Drunken Polish nun caused accident, tried to conceal it
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but the car was driven by another nun who tried to take the blame.
When police told her that she could still lose her driver's license for not giving way and driving away from the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had crashed into the vehicle and asked for help.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
They subjected her to a breath test and after they found out that she had over two per mille in her blood, they immediately revoked her driver's license.
At the same time, they told her that she would answer for her actions in court.
Dog Hugo does what he can.
But Juraj Šajmovič did not guard his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have seen themselves in American stories about dog pets.
But they forgot an essential thing: the laws of the film craft.
After F. Brabec's kitschy film Gump - The Dog Who Taught People to Live, another film Tady strážujeme my (Here We Watch) is now competing for audience emotions in cinemas.
The co-author of the screenplay and director Juraj Šajmovič Jr. loosely builds on his previous film Here I Watch from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some familiar characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a Šumava guesthouse that is dying, so they start inviting dog owners, Julia's father and partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Shajmovic (who is also the film's producer) had already struggled with the storytelling techniques in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog were entertained.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of wonder and embarrassment.
Let's sum up.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to obscurantist delusions in her desire for a child, and if the right "constellation" comes, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan wherever she determines the coordinates – on the hood of a car or church tower (of course, during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), retired colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the forest, who falls into a coma, whereupon she is taken away from the hospital by the family,  so that in the heart of Šumava solitude a miraculous process of healing by a dog could take place.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
However, the viewer is amazed at what a content pelmel full of implausible situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of thieves from the staff, a dog competition and a Šumava charlatan, cops coming to look for "drugs" and discussing herbs about the fertilizing power of bone meal – and which, of course, the well-baked family in the guesthouse gets drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma and then sits at the family table wearing make-up and making up with a cigarette and demands her father's whiskey and slacking as a cured vegetarian, it is impossible not to laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that "it happens sometimes after a coma".
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with texts, the ability to build load-bearing situations, a sense for the characters and the point, and directorial leadership.
The acting is uneven, the editing helpless and the overall impression dirty.
No matter how much Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková and Nela Boudová try to cope with their parts, they don't have much to play.
The only advantage of the film remains the poetic shots of the Šumava countryside by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It's not enough to sketch a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog catchphrases, let alone the more popular vulgar expressions that the characters commit.
The argument is not even long-term membership in the Club of Dachshund Breeders - as in the case of the producer.
Behind the good intentions of promoting nature and friendship between man and the dog must be knowledge of the craft if one wants to tell a believable story.
That failed in this case.
For a good family picture, there's a bit too much eroticism and a minimum sense of genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateurly conceived piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant insults from idiots like you.
There's a difference between offering and coercing, you can see how you understand that shit, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he does not want to, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to such kid all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in his case a brigade for extra earnings.
The Middle East suffers from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have seen at some stations, is unusual," the Israel Meteorological Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term rainfall average for November.
This week's two-day rain was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
It's also the right Christmas backdrop, rejoiced Nazareth resident Wasem Ashkar.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, it is sudden and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
Israel's largest freshwater source, the Sea of Galilee, was filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers warned of drought a long time ago.
"It is to be expected that depending on global warming and climate change, precipitation may decrease here," Uri Schor, a spokeswoman for the Israel Water Authority, predicted in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination and wastewater recycling.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
Tankers are increasing on the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman.
Water mains and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years," said Imad Suleiman, a tanker driver, in September.
Clashes broke out between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The bed of the local river was completely without water.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel prepares military action against Iran
Israel's defense minister said the talks in Vienna had yielded "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis reports.
Gantz, who is in the US, is trying to persuade the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said the nuclear talks in Vienna had yielded "no progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are messing with them."
About 3 years ago, this also happened to me.
I teased the lady a little and grilled her during the conversation to find out what she wanted from me.
Eventually, I found out that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, I scolded the lady with doubts and questions for a while and finally thanked her and left.
Feel free to tell me I'm a bastard, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains at the weekend, waiting for them plenty of snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major onslaught of people interested in skiing this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operating.
Downhill skiers were not discouraged by the obligation to prove themselves with a covid certificate at the lifts.
While ski lifters do not complain about the lack of customer interest, some ski equipment rentals report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region went to cross-country trails and slopes at the weekend.
Skiers liked the weather, which today offered sun and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out from the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," Jakub Hanuš, director of the Ještěd Sports Complex, praised the interest.
Hundreds of people went for the first weekend skiing in the new season also to the Jeseníky Mountains.
For example, Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branná in the Šumperk region were open.
Weekend attendance was very decent, on Saturday and today came an estimated 400 people.
The conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, did not spare praise representative of the ski resort in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or are in the period after suffering from covid-19.
With a few exceptions, people are ready for this and show the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski centre told the Czech News Agency.
"We have only seen incident units," he added.
Lower interest than before the pandemic is reported by some ski equipment rentals and shops.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Opava Skiopava store.
He expects a greater strain during the ski courses.
David Šintak, the executive director of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear, also feels that due to covid, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost borrowed.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told the Czech News Agency.
According to him, people have become lazy with the pandemic and have learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, there is a great demand for the rental in the Novako area in Boží Dar.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested must now order them in advance.
"We are starting to rent cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect great interest, just like last year," said the operator of the ski area, Pavlína Nováková.
According to her, there is also interest comparable to the period before the epidemic in the ski school.
If we do not want the successful and rich to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality of life here as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist healthcare, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and skilful people go abroad and have no property here.
A business owner really doesn't just go abroad.
But I totally agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began when one fine day Orbán won, ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naïve to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
The next question is elections in general.
If life is bad here, some traditional V4 madman can also win here.
The young and educated will leave, leaving his supporters and people whose property cannot be put on the plane.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in the blood because of a bet on beer?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the film The Island led by Jiří Langmajer (55) was enjoying the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor posted a bloodied photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it makeup for filming?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behavior and we're starting to worry a lot about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth police department, where she worked, said in a video Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
She said the missing Czech woman left work at around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28, and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
She was last reportedly seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nurses' assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the hospital's association Guy's and St Thomas'.
"We are extremely concerned for our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the health care facility group said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help locate her to contact the police," the statement continued.
Deputy Harriet Harman, who drew attention to Srncová's case during a press conference on Saturday, is also calling on the public to cooperate.
"She's been missing for days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably scared to death," the Labour politician said, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by London police.
"I feel like we all have a particularly big responsibility to try to find her because she was away from her home country, away from her family, and she was working here for our health service," Harman said.
Police had previously detained one man in connection with the case and remains in custody.
According to the BBC, police have not provided any information on his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine like that either.
These are not "huge quantities", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of an invasion and is getting fed up with our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know from what he concluded that Russia wanted war.
War is a hell of an expensive joke, and Russia has Italy's GDP.
The comparison with the situation in '38 is off the mark at so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can compare this with the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it was not going to abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia would annex those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that would be the "concentration" at the border.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections
Passengers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) will undergo several changes from Sunday, mainly concerning suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed the route, and others disappeared.
The Mladá Boleslav region is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital, fast trains from České Budějovice stop at the Zahradní Město station from Sunday.
Suburban train transport will be operated by S7 trains, which pass through Prague's main railway station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
The recently opened Praha-Zahradní Město station will be newly visited by the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov.
PID will newly expand to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatno u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladá Boleslav region will be included, including lines with an overlap to the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones will be introduced and 12 operating lines will be adjusted.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Prague's Zličín and will go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection Prague – Kralovice u Rakovníka was also established, replacing the cancelled S53 train line.
Connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened during the morning rush hour and at weekends, when express line number 404 will newly depart.
Lines 400 and 410 going to the Liberec Region are newly included in the PID system.
They depart from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Nádraží Holešovice station.
Backbone line 400 goes via Mělník, Dubá and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes via Mělník and Dubou to Doksy, Mimoň and Jablonné v Podještědí.
On the other hand, the operation of ten Central Bohemian local lines, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšínem, has been cancelled or restricted.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem and around Kolín.
Changes are also awaiting passengers in other locations.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or the section on line 420 from Dobříš is being extended with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets all the way to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in the Nymburk region have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen Region have been modified.
Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I do classic 9-5 with a break of 30min and my only option where to get food is to go next door to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I have no movement, I do not have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and I quickly buy pizza, buns and yogurt and apple for snacks.
Question: what healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, unfortunately it is.
And it's not about the trees that you necessarily have to see.
Only the tip of a tree can hide under the snow.
If it is damaged, the sapling may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying that's the only reason they forbid us to go off-piste, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about her relationship with Nedved: I wasn't looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech showbiz pond has been alive with nothing more than revealing the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They have been together since the summer, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent fans a comprehensive message explaining why she kept her love a secret from them for six months.
"I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would miss that Dara hunted a bear, sorry, Nedvěd," jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer up to her ears.
But apparently he packed it, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to the public interest, they are not happy about it.
And here it is.
What we both weren't looking forward to, but we knew would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether those who are not interested at all and it jumps out at them even from the can, or us, whose lives they dissect in detail.
As if any of you wanted to hear an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend are a good match, or you insist that everyone really know the list of your former partners in detail and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's what you want, Dara said.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins traveled to prepare their new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been working there for a long time as the vice-president of the Juventus football club.
They only went out with the truth now, because they were waiting for the completion of Nedvěd's divorce.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but they have not been married on paper for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, thank you.
We too are only people, we have families, children, the past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband and just as he stands by me, I stand by him, for better or for worse, Rolins concluded.
Hi, other commenters have probably already said everything important, I just confirm that the dormitories are great to begin with, my classmates usually met and became friends during the first semester or two and then found subleases together, which seems to me to be the best option, because you know who you will live with.
Apartments are usually not advertised too long in advance, so you probably won't find much right now, but it certainly doesn't hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Cejl, but also the surroundings (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), and some parts of Židenice are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student, Královo pole and in that direction it is fine, besides, it is close to most of the BUT faculties (I do not know where exactly you are entering).
I have never looked for rent, but I am a native of Brno, so I can possibly advise Brno as such, if you still lack some information :)
But this is an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what a few doctors somewhere in Poland have decided to do, it is actually quite right that the state does not sufficiently fund some schools.
Either let them learn what they want and pay for it from their own pocket, or let them go according to the state and the state pays for it.
After all, we cannot let a private actor take over a piece of education just because he adds a few crowns to a full-fledged state contribution, and thanks to this he will be able to teach what he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who two days earlier made such a comment about the petition for a boycott of the totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone having an abortion is for you the same as a vote against a statue standing in a square?
If I were you, I would consult directly with the person who assigned you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloguing / digitization that (even long-time professionals) either somehow throw it out of the eye, or write something like xxx *** or ... (by convention) and into the note that it is illegible.
The truth is that in this case it is quite legible, so I would probably not recommend it.
Personally, I would deal with it in a note depending on what program you use.
If you want to be a regular and diligent student, you can look into some character databases and find the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer has simply created his own emblem that fits what is physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't it more of an Odryn empire than an Odryn empire?
PSS: Someone has already cracked it for you here.
Check out that comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians do not even know what the 'theme' of our Presidency will be.
This is a much worse problem than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is funny.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, some basic knowledge of English is not enough anyway, that is a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, and English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts and establishing above-standard relationships.
Moreover, with the English it is quite interesting, after the withdrawal of GB from the EU.
I don't understand the hatred on Cejl.
I've been working there for three years now and it's completely fine.
How many times I drive from work even at 10 in the evening and never any problem.
The fact that it is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly set foot there in his life.
Yes, most of the Romani population of Brno probably lives there, but all they do is obstruct the pavement and park where they don't have :D It's definitely not that I'm afraid to go out on the street in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I would go for it.
A lot of apartments there are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his lover Gelemová like a stake in the fence!
Who will they spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Dada's wreath and Lucie certainly has one too, the saxophonist told Blesk, confirming Patrasová's words that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda remained alone after his departure.
Slováček still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anna, Felix and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we kept talking, so there was no Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts continuously and I will definitely buy Dada and Lucie something, probably perfume.
"I'm a gentleman," added Felix, who himself came to the launch of the music video at the Richman Club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slováček, who was glad to meet Luděk Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
And we are Iceland so that we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that should be a bad argument, explain that to me?
I do not know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
Cops are few and they cannot afford it, so firefighters themselves and nowhere else such a high percentage of medically trained people is at such a level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend Ostrava just goes to the previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the countryside should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountain and foothill areas, and less precipitation is recorded in places where there has not been a shortage of moisture so far.
The cause of the drought in much of Central Europe is climate change.
But the impact is also amplified by the way we manage the land.
What to prepare for in connection with drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
yes, it's going to be like that, I can barely keep myself on the ice, mushrooms I know what it's like to play hockey and the tactics (what I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are also generally haluz.
And whether you are a hockey team "Medved Russia" or "Lama China", losing by two goals, even if you do not have to win the game at all costs, is different than when it is compared.
But anyway, what I listen to Czech commentators who point out, what referees don't notice whether men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or F1 motorsport, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it was the other way around, it is like always, and that the Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than it won, it would probably be a classic "they lost" vs "WE won".
Coronavirus: Number of infections in Russia exceeds 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
5766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic is 1967 per 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections were registered.
It's the lowest daily number since Oct. 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10 016 896.
The daily death toll is 1132, the lowest daily death toll since late October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" major wave of infections caused by Omicron, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for Britain's Health Security Authority, said on television on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects the number to rise.
So far, no one has died from the omicron, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
British Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson may have broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister in Johnson's government defended that the quiz was done "virtually", via a computer.
However, it was attended by groups of employees gathered around computers in Downing Street.
In Britain, pressure is mounting to remove Johnson from the premiership.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers threw numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV's UK Commercial TV Editor: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a landslide in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about removing him from the post of Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events unfolded.
Want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary faces elections in the spring that could end Viktor Orbán's twelve-year rule.
These will be elections of pan-European importance.
How much can we expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't even be free, because the last two elections under Orbán were not like that.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to profit from it, and does other smaller or bigger tricks.
The latest one is that everyone can vote where they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to bring voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating that they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
Previously, it was not a question of whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that a united opposition will win more votes and seats.
This is very unusual for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even harder in an effort to maintain power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have been doing so far.
Recently, a recording was leaked to the independent media of the speaker of parliament and one of the Fidesz leaders, László Kövér, telling the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach that you are talking about?
Yes, that's one of the novelties.
It all starts with the language.
I was beaten quite often, the last time was when I was 14, my parents mom doesn't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has had it for a long time, but then he bangs extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I was angry as a little girl terribly, to the extent that I was lying on the floor in a cramp and was all blue, they took me under the shower about 2 times to calm down.
Sometimes they slapped me educationally, sometimes it was more that they didn't know anymore.
I definitely also have a tendency to solve things by force, as a little girl I was quite fighting, now I at least hit something to discharge and when I was younger I slaps my parents on the arm for example (so as not to get too much over the hand), so never anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I can't tell to what extent it's my explosiveness, but I'm sure my upbringing has a part in it too.
I'm afraid I'll also lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that hitting children is simply wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at the moment when it was no longer "educational", but out of frustration, on the other hand, perhaps every parent just screws something up, it's probably not possible not to defile their children at least a little, so I don't blame them.
It doesn't offend me, I don't see why OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call Kundami those who make laws of such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you are not afraid of a loss of income?
Can you really count on the fact that people want and buy the product and you will have something to pay the mortgage from?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the trial of four accused of the murders of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner has changed Slovakia.
It set civil society in motion, but it also revealed the practices of accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How fundamental a turning point will the process mean for Slovakia?
Journalists are tremendously to blame for this.
How is it possible that this petition received much more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all medical faculties, which came out a day or two later?
No, they let themselves be fooled and the company jumped off.

The next government is coming to an end and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of the repository is nowhere
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be fundamentally reworked
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is over and the law, which was supposed to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected in the selection and permitting of a deep repository for high-level radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The Government's Legislative Council has suspended consideration of a proposal submitted to the Government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the municipalities concerned associated in the Platform Against the Deep Repository, but also with the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Municipalities expect the law to significantly strengthen their possibilities in deciding on the repository, which has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The draft law by Minister Karel Havlíček, which the Platform has at its disposal, is criticized by municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the selection of a site for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Repository Administration to obtain the consent of the municipalities concerned before initiating specific proceedings.
The submitted draft of the factual intention almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of municipalities practically mere statists in permit proceedings.
The proposal lacks a system setting of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a site for the repository, its permitting and operation.
In reality, according to today's legal standards, municipal representatives do not have many options to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a place for a repository.
Only in certain authorisation procedures can they submit comments or appeal, but the authority or minister in whose interest it is to issue the authorisation decides.
Any action shall not suspend the execution of exploration or construction work.
The co-decision of local governments requested by the Platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those where they have already made progress in permitting a repository, such as Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and linked to contracts with attorney Jan Zemánek.
The total amount for these works should amount to almost CZK 4 million according to the contract register.
Antonín Seknička, Deputy Mayor of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesman for the Platform Against Deep Repository, said: After the ministers of industry, who only postponed the equalization of the position of local authorities vis-à-vis state authorities in the search for a deep repository for highly radioactive waste, we expect a more significant turn from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We would also like to thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for its support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a fundamental construction similarly to the municipalities directly concerned in selected localities.
The Platform Against Deep Repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and 16 associations) in order to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to the deep repository.
The Platform also advocates that the decision on the selection of a site for possible storage should be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually frightened by doctors.
They told him that if he did not lose weight, he would die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, half his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He showed off his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body was causing furniture to crack.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
"I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still anymore," Goodman, whose transformation is amazing, told ABC.
It also depends on which boss and what you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it's some text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it was a formal text and perhaps a university text, I would probably look for how to describe or explain the boss.
On top of that, there are more types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, right, and so the "boss" is something like a master/ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) that do not need to be defeated at all in order to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where there are bosses, but the player does not directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called that?
And then there are the mini bosses.
It is not possible to translate the boss in one word, Czech and other languages do not solve it somehow (interesting is only Catalan, which translates the boss as the final opponent).
In short, it is significant for a story or game in general, computer-controlled, an opponent stronger than all previous ones and guarding the completion of a level or task.
The whole world is searching for missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
British police have been searching for missing Petra Srncová since 3 December.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
She has been looking for the 32-year-old woman from Uherské Hradiště since 7 December.
Through Interpol, he also assists the British police.
Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular because of it.
So the whole world is searching for Petra.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," confirmed police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
"We are sharing information about the case," she added.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from the Uherské Hradiště region.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, as such a disappearance is very unusual for her
Harriet Harman, MP, was also involved in the search for Petra.
She was involved in hanging leaflets with Petra's face.
"We are very concerned about her," she said at a Saturday news conference.
British police have already arrested one suspect in connection with the disappearance.
But it is not clear who he is and what he had in common with Petra.
The pre-Christmas Czech Republic is terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, attacks intensified significantly last month as the year drew to a close.
We saw a major campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
An infected attachment in an email is meant to draw the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word invoice in its name, this time it was marked as Copy of corrections of receipts for 11.2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Yandex email clients.
Malicious code actively searches for stored credentials, which it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of attackers is growing again.
In November, the Formbook spyware also remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November caught campaigns with global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but still accounts for nearly a fifth of all detections.
The attacks took place continuously throughout the month with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
Formbook most often contained an attachment with the extension .exe, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name receipt continues to appear.
An attachment in Czech can be much more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts have recorded a significant decline and decline in activity in the Fareit program, which accounted for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had any major attack campaign in the Czech Republic for the past few months.
Today's demo of smart people who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The procession through Prague was bigger than the media reported.
Judging by the footage of the procession along the waterfront and my experience as a protester, I am not afraid of an estimate of around 10,000 people.
People in the procession filled the embankment and the bridge and the opposite embankment road.
That means a lot of people.
The procession of about four thousand demonstrators is spontaneously joined by an unprecedented number of passers-by.
I say that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the persistent discontent of several large groups or strata of the population led them to find common ground.
Only the anti-vaxers, anti-maskers and co. alone would not be able to fill or pay for such a large parade.
The events of the Chcípl pes association have an upward popularity, it reminds me of A Million Moments for Democracy Inside Out.
Sometimes I have the impression that they rent the same stage and equipment.
It's hard to say what kind of movement could be bribed out of this discontent, depending not only on the money supply, but also on whether the three-dose Pfizer vaccine becomes four or more doses.
It's definitely not going to be a leftist or centrist movement, you bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multidose, because it is obvious that we will have to get a booster every six months.
I am very glad that the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant action of scientists, of which humanity is rightly proud.
End of stalemate, Bulgaria has a new prime minister preaching change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption movement Continuing to Change, which won the November elections, to form a new government.
It has already managed to form a government of a broad coalition that should take office in a few days.
The country's political crisis has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
But the victorious parties preaching the fight against bribery and abuse of power could not agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
The "secretly" captured footage is a global hit.
In Britain, fears grew over the weekend about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been wanted by London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work to the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, the police are calling for information about the children's hospital worker from her current employer or MP representing the part of London where she lived.
"Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behavior and we're starting to worry a lot about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth police department, where she worked, said in a video Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
She said the missing Czech woman left work at around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28, and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
She was last reportedly seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nurses' assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the hospital's association Guy's and St Thomas'.
"We are extremely concerned for our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the health care facility group said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help locate her to contact the police," the statement continued.
The amateur painter of children's rooms from Šumperk, Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also a regional pirate councillor), was accused by an anonymous person that her paintings violated copyright.
However, the court acknowledged that the paintings of Little Mole in the Šumperk rooms did not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, there was a hole in the road for a month in the form of a canal without a hatch.
Life was at stake.
The municipality referred the complaints to the RMD, which owns the road, and because it apparently did not respond, the hole continued.
In the end, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the RMD began to "intensively address the situation".
