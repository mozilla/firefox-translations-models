This fact not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (this theory is already widespread), but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, for example, about color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotene-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a very developed spine called rachis, but have other features - rays and hooks - the researchers concluded that rachis probably evolved later than these other traits.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature control or demonstration.  Scientists assume that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not a cub.
Scientists assume that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, it represents a pattern of plumage of an adult animal, and not the feathers of a cub.

Based on the luminosity and rotation, the Rossby number of the star, which is related to the plasma flux, is determined.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic turnover.

The work was mostly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team searched for a phenomenon that would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force on the Earth and causes the tides of the sea surface, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter in the galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of "halo" and consists of lots of small particles.

"They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their heat changes are not as stable as those of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but this is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the astrology team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the University of Northern Arizona, located in Flagstaff.
In France, voting traditionally takes place without modern technology: voters isolate themselves in a locker room and put a pre-printed sheet of paper in an envelope, listing the candidate they have elected.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter throws an envelope into the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.
The French electoral law contains quite a strict codification of the electoral process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been transparent so that voters and observers can testify that there were no envelopes before voting began and that no envelopes other than those placed by counted and eligible voters were added.
Candidates can send representatives, who then witness the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

The road where the collision happened was temporarily closed while emergency services extricated the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was subsequently charged by an Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but witness evidence may be spoiled because her picture has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently and the courts have seen the publication of the photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, notes that "journalists seem to be walking on thin ice if they publish photos of suspects and others."
The prosecutor's office, which is in charge of the prosecution, told journalists that at least until charges are filed, no further information will be provided.
According to the leak, the document will concern border disputes in which Palestine wants to preserve the borders as they were before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics covered appear to include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the treaty is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence for only five years.
The shooters were under the strict supervision of rangers during the supplementary pest control study, as the study was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In collaboration with NPSW and NSW Inc (Australian Sport Shooters Association), qualified volunteers were recruited under the auspices of the association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, NPWS's acting director of natural heritage conservation, the four shooters selected for the first shooting received comprehensive safety training and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday in the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of measures to move the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to massive anti-government protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, and some have been ongoing since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of faulty iPods were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 other overheating incidents that the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in the report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck in Mariana at 07:19 local time (Friday 20:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Authority said no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six deaths have been confirmed at this time.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were soon released, as were Filipino photographers.
Photographers later replaced the elderly lady because she needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While Liggins worked in the hospital, in his spare time he began to deal with premature births.
His research showed that when a hormone is administered, it accelerates the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua news agency said government investigators discovered two "black boxes" with flight records on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "The Moon was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager. The Moon died during the night when there were two moons in the sky. Unique, just like herself. She was a strong woman.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels stated that "Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe even more... I loved her and I will miss her... Perhaps it's somewhere better."
An opinion poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election showed that the number of people opposed to turning Australia into a republic had risen by 8 per cent compared to 2008.
The leader of the caretaker government, Julia Gillard, said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
As for extreme views in the survey, 29 per cent believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 per cent think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his eligibility was questioned due to his objections.
He could not take the medicine needed to overcome the pain, as pharmaceuticals are forbidden at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
The discovery using various hardware and software was verified by several people in early February and announced on Tuesday.
Comets can be a source of water supply on earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how Earth has formed since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his tenure as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and recklessness."
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that would allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions each year, according to the FAA.
Compared to ground-based radar technology, it uses satellite technology that allows air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater accuracy and provides pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no extra traffic, no above-ground train services will be built at Wembley, and there are no on-site car parks or park-and-ride areas.
Concerns about a lack of transport options increased the chances that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science describes the emergence of new bird species on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although the process was thought to take much longer, due to breeding among endemic finches, Darwin's middle finches, and immigrant cactus and conic finches.
Gold can be processed into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled up into miniature pieces.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be bent and braided. It can be chipped or pressed into slices.
It can be processed to considerable thinness and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it has often been used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator yourself using the juice of red cabbage.
The juice of cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (letter H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had electrons taken away (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then form a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, resulting in a strange sensation and forming a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of wastewater drainage systems have been found in Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
They also had toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In ancient Rome, toilets were sometimes part of public baths frequented by men and women together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite to make a call.
A satellite in space receives a call and then its signal bounces back down almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space using a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because Earth's atmosphere partially distorts our light and field of view.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, it takes a large rocket that measures over 100 feet.
The wheel has changed the world in an unprecedented way. The most significant thing that caused was a significant facilitation and acceleration of transport.
He brought us a train, a car and other means of transport.
Below them are medium-sized felines, whose food consists of medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are plenty of small cats (including wild domestic cats) whose main part of their diet consists of small prey such as insects, rodents, reptiles and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the system of ecological niches, i.e. each cat has its own tasks that do not allow it to compete with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called packs.
The pack consists of one to three related adult males along with up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely related and represent a large family consisting of sisters and daughters.
A lion pack behaves similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A tiger can climb (although not well), swim, jump long distances and pull with five times more force than a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (genus panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the roar of a lion at full throat, but rather like a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they have the opportunity, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than he himself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, where they can sniff where they have moved on the ground.
They see very well at night thanks to night vision and are able to move very quietly. Ocelots hunt by merging with their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population they come from (for example, when they cross a mountain ridge or river or move to a new island from which it is not easy to get back), they often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or ways of adapting to become a stronger competitor than in the past.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, in a few thousand or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe and take in the carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants produce nourishment from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the foods we eat are plant-based. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the ultimate predator of its time, so it had no fear of anything except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were covered with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set planted on the top floor, meaning nothing that crossed his path had a chance to escape.
We don't know for sure, but they may have had a forked tongue. Their diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and possibly cannibals.
They also attacked anything that entered the water. Even a large dinosaur like T. rex was no match for them.
While most of their dishes would not be alien to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual compositions of feasts, including a wild boar, a peacock, a snail, and a species of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that women and poor people ate their food sitting on chairs, while rich men liked to feast together and lie on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman dishes could not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia only in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple to each of their gods, which was considered his home.
Humans offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The highlight of the tower was a special shrine designed for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place in the open air.
Women cooked in the backyard; The shops were only open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no extensive forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, it is written that Eric the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it the Green Land.
Despite his find, there were already Eskimo tribes living there.
Although all countries were part of "Scandinavia", there were many differences between the inhabitants, kings, customs and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original of the Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776". The text is at the bottom of the document, written upside down.
Although the author is not known with certainty, it is clear that the large parchment document (dimensions 293/4 x 241/2 inches) was rolled up and stored not long after its creation.
It is therefore likely that the entry was added simply as an add-on.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles brought about the liberation of northern France, but the south of the country was not yet liberated.
It was ruled by the French "Vichy". It was the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invading forces instead of fighting.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France. The invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French Forces liberated southern France and turned to Germany.
Civilization is a certain culture, common to a significant large group of people who live and work in cooperation with each other, i.e. together they form a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis" which means "civil" and is related to the Latin "civis" which means "citizen" and also "civitas", which means city or city-state, and at the same time it defines the greatness of society in a certain way.
The ancestors of nations were city-states. The culture of civilization is characterized by the transmission of knowledge over several generations, the presence of long-lasting cultural traces and adequate dissemination.
Small-scale cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states first formed a weak central government, with Congress being its only branch under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial body, it relied on state agencies, which often did not cooperate, to enforce laws.
It also had no authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be supplemented. States took the central government lightly, so much so that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, together with the German national football team, and Italy won the World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, inline hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands and the largest of them is Honshu, so Japan is actually the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is sometimes called an "archipelago" in a geographical sense.
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when nearby European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, a beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the original grain production practices, employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644–1912) took control of the southwestern and northern coasts of Taiwan, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonosec Peace Treaty, under which it transferred sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan. It ruled this island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main footings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photo format in the world is 35mm, which was the most common film size at the height of the analog film era.
They are still produced today, but more importantly, their aspect ratio has been adopted by the formats of digital camera sensors.
Although somewhat confusing, the 35mm format actually has a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
Thus, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio in integers) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The often abused and ridiculed "rule of thirds" is a simple guideline that creates dynamics in the picture while maintaining a certain order.
According to this specification, the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had acquired wealth and power, became the target of detailed scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united European countries despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power had an impact on everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the Church's monetary resources are there for that very purpose.
The central authority of the Church has been in Rome for more than 1,000 years. This concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of clashes, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective because it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated universally accepted international law codified by several international agreements dating back two centuries.
Britain cruised international waters to prevent ships from reaching entire areas of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Since this tactic met with only a limited reaction, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestrained undersea military forces.
During the twenties, attitudes of pacifism and isolation prevailed among most citizens and nations.
As witnesses to the horror and cruelty of the First World War, nations longed to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (a supervisor from his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different time periods; each time of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war took place between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Epoch of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of ancient China, when thousands of people died fighting for the throne in the Grand Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, or the belief that the land belongs to the people, not to one ruler.
After the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of the military, as instead of class-based military ranks, it is now skill that matters.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed workers from other countries to try to start a revolution in their countries.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters outside the realm of secular life. He often visited the cave known as "Hira" on a mountain called "Noor" (light) and contemplated there.
The cave itself, which has survived for a considerable time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual focus.
Nestled on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find, even if it is known that it exists. Inside the cave is in complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen but a beautifully clear sky and a large number of surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created as a tribute to Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The "loop up" sign looks like the letter V, and the "bow down" looks like a clip or square that is missing the underside.
Top means that you start at the tip and push the bow, bottom means that you start at the flip-flop (where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Upward movement usually produces a softer sound, while downward movement is stronger and more penetrating.
You can write your own marks on the sheet in pencil, but keep in mind that printed marks have a reason from a musical point of view, so they should usually be followed.
A terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister Elizabeth Philippine of France were forced to return from Versailles to Paris by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789.
They drove back to Paris in a carriage that surrounded the turbulent crowd, shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to leave the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point in Versailles, a member of a criminal group waved the head of the royal guard in front of the horrified queen.
The war costs of US imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to pay a large part of the expenses, with interest on the bonds flowing in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses on Wall Street.
The extra surplus value drawn from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos would, of course, constitute the basic proceeds of US imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the Order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, according to most opinions, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas: for example, the so-called technology pusch or technological imperative, or the belief that human fate is governed by all-pervading logic, along with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology has an "influence" on societies that are inherent rather than on socially conditioned societies.
We can say, for example, that when motor cars appear, this will necessarily lead to the development of roads.
But the nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership is also leading to an increase in road accidents, causing new techniques in health care to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism carried a considerable element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geographically formed individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to that geography emerged, and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were superior to arbitrarily enforced laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion center of the contemporary world, Constantinople was known as the fashion center of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its importance diminished during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that crusaders brought valuables, such as silk and spices, back to Europe, and these were priced at home higher than the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, dress was significantly influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication, Western styles lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of this time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to button clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture performed to produce only enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system using seed native to a given ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that make a subculture different can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of the subculture often express their membership through strong and symbolic use of a style that includes dress, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident, or intentional abuse, have not been socialized by adults growing up.
Such babies are called "wolf" children. Some wolf children were imprisoned for long periods of time (usually imprisoned by their own parents), in some cases they lived abandoned because their parents rejected them because of their severe mental or physical disabilities.
Wild children could experience severe abuse or trauma and then be abandoned or run away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, while some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When fully raised by non-human animals, a wild child exhibits almost the same behavior (within physical capabilities) as the caring animal, such as its fear or disregard for humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
The skeleton is not a teaching method, but rather an aid that provides support to those individuals who are undergoing the acquisition of a new practice, for example, using a new computer program or launching a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is a small clip in Microsoft Office.
The software incorporates Virtual Constructs designed to analyze, motivate and explain procedures that might be too challenging for the student himself.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect, abuse to blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment in which he or she does not receive proper nutrition, care and upbringing, but such cases exist.
We believe that the foster care system will be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is intended to provide for all needs that have not been met in the household from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet add another dimension in terms of use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are proposed as important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995)
"Personal engagement" and "continuing interest" were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when examining audience responses to websites.
The use of video footage has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micromessages – facial movements lasting only a few microseconds.
Specifically, by correctly interpreting microexpressions, you can tell if the other person is lying to you.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, suggested how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately judge honesty.
It even suggests that such abilities for interpreting human behavior can be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and manifested.
Mutations add a new genetic variation, and selection removes them from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination will mix up the differences between the two sets within each generation.
It is difficult for primates with human-like digestive systems to meet the need for amino acids from plant sources available in the open savanna.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth of depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant sources would be the protein available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for us as primates to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a high amount of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved the protein problem in the same way that chimpanzees do today on the savannah.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up from normal sleep and falling asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This is easily achieved by using a relatively silent alarm clock that brings you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm while you're sleeping, you can place it on the opposite side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed in order to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before sleep, as they force the person to get up and go to the toilet.
The degree of inner peace of a person corresponds to the opposite of the degree of tension in his body and spirit.
The less tension, the more good the life force brings. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment can be attained by anyone. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been extended to include the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, the principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple. They are Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The centerpiece of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. The clashes of the system, processes and culture led to the breakdown of cooperation between the countries with the end of the war.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted another 40 years, and was indeed fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had already been breached, and the only hope was a retreat and regrouping of forces along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell through almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the troops invaded the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transport is by far the most efficient way to transport large amounts of people and cargo across the ocean.
The traditional task of the naval fleet was to ensure the ability of the state to transport people and goods, but at the same time the navy was also to prevent the enemy from transporting its own people and goods.
One of the most striking recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to move men and materiel across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic, mainly with the help of submarines.
If the Allies failed, then Germany would probably be able to conquer Britain, like the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were mostly kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures and were often guarded by herders, often children or adolescents, like the more famous sheep herders. These methods of pastoralism are still used today.
Horse-drawn railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although stagecoach roads mostly consisted only of parallel boards, they allowed draft horses to reach greater speed and carry heavier loads than on other roads of the time, which were slightly rougher.
Sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was discovered that rails are more efficient if they have a strip of iron on their surface.
This became a common occurrence, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the cars.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, did not, as a rule, walk upright.
Bipeds are found in Australopithecine fossils between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To reduce future suffering to some extent, we can live more environmentally friendly, join the environmental movement, and even become activists.
In many cases, it is the same as symptomatic therapy. However, if we are not only looking for a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problems and get rid of them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and problems have increased due to overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After adoption by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing house.
Between 150 and 200 copies, which are now called "Dunlap Prints," were made overnight.
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of the Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his soldiers in New York on July 9. One of the copies arrived in London on August 10.
The oldest known surviving copies of the document are the so-called. Dunlap broadsides, or a total of 25 copies from Dunlap's printer. The original manuscript copy has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still a lot of features on birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits – or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to make an immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of poisoning can be the presence of an open container with medicines or household products containing toxic chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term beetle is used by entomologists for this group of insects in a formal sense.
This term is derived from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both sneaky and bedbugs are cunning, adapted to life in the nest or housing of their host.
Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis are known across the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the interest of their child.
These couples can opt for an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents waive their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parent.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method is the guideline of most scientific research.
However, this is not experimentation in itself. An experiment is a test that is used to deny one or more possible hypotheses, but asking questions and observations is also important for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all areas of science, including psychology, were adopted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend fundamentally on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sufficient oscillator that continues in the time of a free-flowing cycle even without the presence of external stimuli.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they either labeled the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether germline cells have been affected.
Only germline mutations can be transmitted to children, and mutations occurring elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-oriented tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to admire landscapes, including wildlife and animals.
Examples of activities in this type of tourism: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about the relevant ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars, drive to work, and in the meantime they are passed by others who are heading to work at the place from which they themselves have just left.
Everyone participates in this dynamic shuttle service and supports a transport system based on private vehicles.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has derailed the biosphere from its stable state, which has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone participates in social life and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely come across a similar level of complaint about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail every day? Are traffic engineers simply unfit? Or is it something deeper?
Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, examining the flow of traffic is difficult, because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave similarly within a certain range;  Therefore, the operation usually has some reasonable consistency and can be approximately mathematically depicted.
In order to better represent the flow of traffic, relationships were established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of transportation facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly allowed them to more easily avoid enemies and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them a greater choice of small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Nowadays, they are the only insects that can not fold their wings, dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), moves around the Earth.
That sounds reasonable, because it doesn't occur to man that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth. More than eight times more water flows through it than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, in some places up to six miles wide.
Fully 20 percent of the water that flows from our planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main course of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed either in size or technical precision of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were more than a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican includes about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholic.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, as these elements are found in nature in their pure form and can be relatively easily mined using simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle thought that everything was composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These elements were earth, water, air and fire.
It was more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also theorized that they turn into new substances that make up what we see.
Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are a lot of elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that a dot at the end of this sentence could fit trillions of them.
Therefore, the pencil, after its invention, became a good friend of many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new ways of writing, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and side uses.
People today write messages on computer screens, so they don't come into contact with the sharpener at all.
One can only wonder what happens to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A nuclear fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to hold a nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
It's like carrying a heavy cart up a hill. By redistributing the atomic nucleus, some of this energy is then released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with subtle or even no contact.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called a crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km on the far side.
It is weaker under the sea and stronger under the mountains.
There may be more lunar seas on the nearer side because the crust is thinner. This made it easier for the lava to reach the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding out what can appeal to people or is close to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they embrace as they grow up.
These theories deal with what motivates certain people to want what they do and what in their environment makes them do or not do things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's pyramid theory of needs and Herzberg's theory of two factors.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can occur when managers begin to lead their former peer colleagues. At one end of the spectrum, there is an effort to remain "one of them" (or one of them).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you change beyond recognition and feel that you have to change everything the team does and do it your way.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This often results in disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as touchpoints for their own physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams may meet according to different time zones, which their local leadership may not understand.
A unique component of the virtual team is also the presence of the so-called "invisible team" (Larson – LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
An "invisible team" is a management team to which each member reports. The Invisible Team sets the standards for individual members.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One of the goals for implementing the concepts of a learning organization is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional components of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can be manifested.
As a result, the process of a collaborative organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to new innovative processes to serve the customer's needs.
For an organization to be innovative, its leadership must create an innovative corporate culture, establish knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that organizations use to achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. They thus narrow and refine this area of research.
Scientists in their research are supported by the correlation between brain disease and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause alterations in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to observe and explore brain structures and never-before-seen processes.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for creating simulation models that will help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong connotation with science fiction, it forms a very important area of computer science dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligence adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves creating machines that automate tasks that require intelligent action.
Examples include checking, scheduling, and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, and is built into a variety of home computer applications and video game software.
Excursions are an essential part of every subject. The teacher would often like to take her students to places where bus travel is out of the question.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual excursions. Students can look at artifacts from the museum, visit the aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in class.
Virtual sharing of excursions is also a great way to think about a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website each year about their trip to the state capital. Every year they redesign the site, but the old versions remain online and serve as an album.
Even blogs can improve students' writing skills. Although their blogging in the beginning is often marked by sloppy spelling, the influence of other readers usually changes this.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blog writer tries to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to have an overview of the world around them." The need to stimulate audience interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend education beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "will allow students to improve their analytical and critical skills; By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of other texts and formulate their point of view on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, with a variety of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north they are still waiting to discover the beauty of the Muskoka region and others.
All this and much more emphasizes that Ontario is considered by foreigners to be a typical part of Canada.
Large areas further north are relatively sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Many people will be surprised by the following population figure: there are more African-Americans than Canadian citizens in the US.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and in terms of wildlife we can consider it a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are annexed to France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these countries. He thrived in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north is the area bordered by the Sahel, to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers report themselves as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also a good idea to wear a ring (just be careful not to make it look too expensive).
Women should keep in mind that due to cultural differences, they can sometimes experience harassment and that it is not uncommon for a man to follow a woman while walking, grab her hand, etc.
Be adamant about rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don't justify this!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt the city under the name Casa Branca, and abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dara l-Badya, and Spanish merchants who established trading bases there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagine, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a wide range of trinkets, but all this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets and especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside the city should be well thought out given the current state of the fighting that continues to take place in North Kivu.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and offers one of the cheapest mountain gorilla watching in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use boda boda (motorcycle taxi). The normal price for a short ride is about 500 Congolese francs.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" began to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Timbuktu is now an impoverished city, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction. It also has its own airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites because of the desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS television show Wonders of the African World, hosted by Henry Luis Gates.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it feels more Arabic than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African national parks (SANParks).
As in all National Parks of South Africa, you have to pay a fee for entry to the park and a contribution to nature conservation.
It can also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The city of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong, which many tourists consider to be the main travel destination.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's cityscape is likened to a shimmering bar chart reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite waterfront, Kowloon.
The vast majority of Hong Kong's dense urban development is located on sea-acquired land along the northern coast.
This is a place appropriated by British colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching from the coast for 80 km (50 miles) inland to Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But these forests aren't just mangrove swamps – they include some of the last remaining stretches of mighty jungle that once covered the plains of the Ganges.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3 850 km², of which about a third is covered by water areas or wetlands.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966 and it is estimated that 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 Axis can currently be found in the area.
Buses leave from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30am and 7:30am.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes with a width of 3.5 meters.
The vertical clear height under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, the operation started only in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting the area we know today as eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally called the "Great Province of India", was born as a result of the meeting of the Spanish conquistadors with groups of indigenous people.
The Spaniards began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo courts in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year.
If you're interested in tournaments and where to get tickets for polo matches, check out the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is worth one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, but you may succeed with British and American currency. Be sure to ask the owners in advance what payment method you can use.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so make an exchange before you leave them.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, summer is when it's cold in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winters can be precariously cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but together with wind and humidity, it seems colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "rainy" and "drought" seasons: The amount of precipitation remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, they are still wild animals in the wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the rules of the park, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
Although they appear peaceful, bison, deer, elk, bear and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, many visitors are injured due to not keeping the right distance. These animals are large, wild and can be dangerous, so leave them their space.
Also keep in mind that bears and other wildlife are attracted to smells, so avoid carrying or cooking aromatic foods and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoji is Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 50s of the 18th century and since 1959 has been the official capital of Samoa.
The port was the scene of the infamous maritime stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except one British cruiser were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the independence efforts organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city resulted in the killing of the supreme chairman named Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches here due to the fact that Auckland lies between two ports. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in North Harbour County) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost sandy beaches with the possibility of safe swimming and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are at Waitemata Harbour in the sought-after Mission Bay and St Heliers neighbourhoods of central Auckland.
They are sometimes crowded family beaches with a large selection of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that you can have, but New Zealand and Australian wines could be a better choice.
Tap water is safe here, but bottled water is commonly available if you are worried.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is alien. A little black is an "espresso", a cappuccino is full of cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but top-notch.
Many reef trips are made throughout the year, and injuries caused by any of these causes are rare.
Even so, take the advice of authorities, follow the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Quadrangular plants occur near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of the town of Seventeen Seventy. Sometimes they can be found outside this time.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
The saltwater crocodile does not live actively in the ocean, its primary refuge is the estuary north of the city of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance gives the traveller the certainty that he will have a place to stay at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but they can also be used to book other forms of accommodation such as camping sites.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined airfare and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think or to arrange additional documents for the destination (e.g. visa).
Any modifications or requests should first be directed to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel's address.
In the case of some festivals, a substantial majority of visitors choose to camp on site, and most attendees consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be in the center of the action, you'll need to arrive as early as possible to get a tent spot that's close to the music production.
Keep in mind that while the music on the main stage may have ended, in other sections of the festival the music may continue until late at night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
If you are crossing the Northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as sailing through the ice causes unbearable noise in exposed places.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms and conditions).
Casinos usually try to get guests to spend as much time as possible and spend as much money as possible. Mostly windows and clocks are missing, it is often difficult to find an exit to the outside.
They usually have special food, drinks and entertainment offerings to keep visitors in a good mood and in the casino premises.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages at the company's expense. However, drunkenness negatively affects the ability to judge, so all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone driving at a high altitude or a mountain pass should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive as much as you do on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow falls in a very short time to make it impossible for you to drive.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or flying snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
Ice and snow, on the other hand, are normal in many countries and operations continue without major interruptions throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and for many tourists it is the highlight of the trip.
The term safari in the well-known sense refers to land travel to see stunning African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to the vehicles, so standard equipment allows a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, so you can better observe them with binoculars.
A tourist safari consists of a walking tour lasting from several hours to several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24/08/2021 to 05/09/2021. Some events will be held in different locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted it back in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, this situation may be difficult for you.
Event cancellation policies may vary, but as recently as the end of March, most coronavirus-based event cancellation policies did not apply to July 2020, the time the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 Japanese yen, with regular tickets costing 7,000 Japanese yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help him dry. Many hotels have ironing facilities available for rent, even if not in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not like to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if available.
Be careful not to heat up the fabric too much (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are many ways to purify water, some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it is necessary for several minutes.
Filters have different efficiencies, and if you are concerned, you should buy water in a sealed bottle from a trusted company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests unknown in their home regions.
Troublesome insects can cause spoilage of food, skin irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, the spread of poison or the transmission of infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person by force are usually not classified as pests as such.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and other charges in the areas.
Travellers heading to high-tax countries can sometimes save significant amounts, especially when buying products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the toughest driving conditions on the Buffalo–Pittsburgh highway, as it often passes between isolated wooded terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep angles, narrow lanes and sharp bends prevail.
The speed limit is significantly lower here than on previous and downstream sections – usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to it is even more important.
Interestingly, however, mobile phone services work much better here than in many parts of the road, such as the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are rich and diverse, very similar to their southern neighbors in Austria.
Fruit pastries are common. Apples are used in bread all year round, and cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German baked products also contain almonds and hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular desserts are often especially suitable for a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to taste some hearty sweets, try the desserts, which are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish of various herbs, spices and meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on how much liquid it contains.
In the Mediterranean regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly added to curry. In the south of India and in some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, they usually use coconut milk.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a wide range of regional cuisines from across the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term usually refers to cuisine originating from the central and eastern part of the island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available across the archipelago, contains plenty of simply flavoured dishes dominated by peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups, which hang on both sides of the saddle, serve as a support for the rider's legs.
They provide more stability to the rider, but can be associated with safety issues due to the possibility of the rider's legs getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but his foot gets caught in the stirrup and the horse starts to run, he can pull the rider behind him. A number of precautions can be taken to minimise this risk.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a delicate sole that is quite narrow.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety rails that allow the stirrup belt to fall off the saddle when the falling rider pulls on it.
Chochamo Valley – a popular climbing destination of the Chilean Prime Minister known as the Yosemite of South America, where extensive granite walls and cliffs can be found.
The mountain peaks offer breathtaking views. Climbers from all parts of the world are constantly establishing new routes thanks to the endless potential of the walls.
Winter downhill sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports consisting of downhill skiing on snowy terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
"Skiing is a frequent travel activity with many fans, sometimes known as 'ski wanderers', who plan their entire vacations based on skiing in a particular location."
The idea of skiing is very old. Cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century. The first recreational ski club was opened by the Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Ski tourism: This activity is also referred to as cross-country skiing, skiing or ski trips.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, although they are not part of the activity, the latter of which is done in steep terrain and requires much stronger skis and boots.
Think of a ski route as a similar hiking trail.
Under favorable conditions, you can cover slightly greater distances than on foot – but you will rarely move at the speed you would achieve on cross-country skis without a heavy backpack and on a groomed track.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with a number of independent countries. Normally, traveling through multiple countries would mean going through visa applications and passport control several times.
However, the Schengen area functions similarly to one country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen country separately, which will save you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define as antiques goods more than 100 years old.
This definition has geographical variations, such as the age limit in North America being lower than in Europe.
Handmade items can be classified as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer farming is an important livelihood among the Sami, and trade-related culture is also important for many other professions.
However, not all Sami traditionally engaged in large-scale reindeer breeding, they also made their living by fishing, hunting and similar activities, and then used reindeer only as draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern crafts. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, a Sami region.
Although the term 'gypsy' is used extensively especially among non-Roma populations, it is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma.
If the country you are going to visit becomes subject to a travel recommendation, it may affect your travel medical or cancellation insurance.
You may want to look at the advice of other governments rather than your own, but these are primarily for their own citizens.
An example is US citizens, who may face different situations in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is only a brief summary of the political situation in a given country.
The opinions presented are often cursory, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Inclement weather is a general term for any dangerous weather event with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Stormy weather can occur anywhere in the world, and has different forms that may depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, high rainfall and fires are the forms and consequences of stormy weather such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, cloudbursts and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of all possible risks of inclement weather in their area, as this can affect all travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An Internet search for "Course for a Hostile Environment" will likely find the address of the local company.
The course usually deals in much more detail with all the problems described here, usually also in the form of practical exercises.
The course usually lasts 2-5 days and includes role-based training, thorough first aid training and sometimes weapons handling.
Wildlife survival books and magazines are common, but publications on war zones are scarce.
Passengers planning a gender reassignment operation abroad must ensure that they carry valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without gender (X) or documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
Foreign governments' willingness to honor these documents varies.
Inspections at security checkpoints became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people before surgery should not expect to go through scanners and their privacy and dignity remain intact.
Reverse currents are returning waves that break against the beach, often at the point of a cliff, etc.
Due to the underwater topology, the reverse current is concentrated in several deeper sections, and it is here that a rapid current can be created into deep water.
Most deaths are due to fatigue from trying to swim back upstream, which can be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try heading somewhere where the current won't pull you down again, or wait for help based on your abilities and depending on whether you've been noticed.
The shock of returning comes earlier than the culture shock (there is a smaller phase of initial enthusiasm), lasts longer and may be more severe.
Travellers who have easily adapted to a new culture often have a particularly challenging experience of readjusting to their native culture.
After returning home from a stay abroad, you are used to a new culture and you have already lost some of your habits from home.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, because they knew that travellers in a new country had to adapt.
What people may not realize is that travellers returning home also need patience and understanding.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the performance begins.
You usually hear tourists and vendors all the time. The story of sounds and lights resembles a fairy tale book.
The Sphinx has the function of a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
Various scenes are projected onto the pyramids, individual pyramids are gradually illuminated.
Discovered in 1819, South Shetland Islands are claimed by more landers and have the most bases – 16 were active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the mainland. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains merge here into a plateau, and then reappear to form a 360 km long chain of Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided in half by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part or in the Sentinel ridge is the highest mountain range of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif with the 4892 meters high peak of Mount Vinson.
In remote locations with no mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, because in order to make calls, you need to be outside without obstacles between you and the satellite.
This service is often used by shipping, including recreational craft as well as expeditions that need remote data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a year off is to travel and learn.
It's especially popular with people who are finishing school. It allows them to take a year off before entering university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad after leaving secondary school can improve your chances of higher education in your home country.
Tuition fees will usually be charged for enrolment in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also includes thousands of islands in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
On archipelagos and lakes it is not absolutely necessary to have a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are really large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak will offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland – there is one boat for every seven to eight people.
It is similar in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands this number is one in forty).
Baltic Sea cruises usually have a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit this historic city for several full days and return to the boat at night and sleep on it.
If you go ashore only on cruise tours, you will not need a separate visa (valid since 2009).
Some tours in the brochure include German Berlin. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the tour.
Air travel can be scary for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if this is their first flight or if they've had a traumatic experience.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and aversions to other things that so many people have.
For some people, understanding how planes work and what happens during flight can help them overcome their fear of the unknown or feeling out of control.
Mail order companies are well paid for the prompt delivery of goods. Time is often a very important factor for business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and smaller companies, there is a problem.
If the items were sent by air freight, then on some routes it could take several days for the items to pass through unloading and customs control.
The only way to do this faster is to send the item as checked baggage. However, airline regulations do not allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and this is where you come in.
The most common way to fly first or business class is to pull out a thick chunk of money (even better to get your business to do it for you).
But it's not cheap: you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy ticket in business class and eleven times in first class!
Generally speaking, it makes no sense to look for discounts on flights from point A to point B for first or business class.
Airlines are well aware that there is a key group of passengers who are willing to pay extra for the privilege of getting somewhere fast and comfortable, and prices reflect this.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multinational republic plagued by various ethnic conflicts.
This conflict led in 1994 to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between the two parts of Moldova have been restored despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of around 3.7 million, Izmir is Turkey's third-largest city, the second-largest port and an important transport hub after Istanbul.
What was once an ancient city, Smyrna is now a modern, developed and bustling commercial center, located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, glass buildings and modern shopping centres are crisscrossed with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market and old mosques and churches, although the city has an air of Mediterranean Europe rather than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, interesting marble statues of doves can be seen above some of the tombs.
The half hour walk around this interesting village is well worth it.
To the north and within easy reach is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, famous among foreigners for its beauty described by Lord Byron.
Scotturb bus 403 goes to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, also visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, which is a world-famous place of apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass burial site and also a site of almost incalculable importance to a significant part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived internment there, and many more whose loved ones were murdered or died of exhaustion from forced labor, Jews and non-Jews alike.
In this place, please behave with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Don't joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't disfigure the site with markers or graffiti scratches into structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers Catalan, a significant majority understand it and virtually everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs and inscriptions are only in Catalan, as Catalan is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is commonly used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned outages are announced by an automated system in many different languages – Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being selfish, rude and arrogant.
Although often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with others in Paris is to behave as well as possible, that is, to act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-behaved). It will make all your movement much easier.
The outward impression that Parisians are somewhat violent quickly fades if you show even basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, especially beech, spruce and fir, and offers a mixture of alpine vegetation with Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the diverse microclimate, diverse soil and different altitudes, there are very different plant communities.
The area is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
In addition to many more common species, rare fauna such as brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and grouse can be found here.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear knee-covering skirts and to cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide plaids to women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a colourful one, you'll earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear knee-covering pants.
Even this can be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but this clothing is not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For men, they have only one size!
Mallorcan cuisine, like the cuisine of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and often uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is called Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available ingredients such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns along with the word Sie (you) are always capitalized at the beginning and even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated due to the need to find out if a verb or adjective is used in a noun form.
In Italian, the pronunciation is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are C and G, as their pronunciation varies according to the vowel that follows them.
Also beware of the different pronunciations of the r and rr sounds: "caro" means "expensive", while "carro" means "chariot".
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
So, if you read these basics of grammar, you will learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the individual phrases.
Needless to say, if you know any of the Romance languages, learning Portuguese will be easier for you.
However, people who know a little Spanish may be quick to conclude that Portuguese is so similar that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now mostly obsolete and serve as museums or places of education.
Because light pollution at their peak was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Observation of cherry blossoms known as hanami has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept comes from China, where plum blossoms were a popular flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were held by the emperor only for him and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even a "single" specimen.
If you visit a formally furnished garden, you will be fired for collecting "specimens" without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe country to stay. It is also very easy to navigate there and you can buy almost everything upon arrival.
"But since it's located in the 'true tropics'' just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to deal with heat (always) and fierce sun (when skies are clear, less often)."
Some buses also run north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that your intended bus goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be an interesting place to go on holiday.
For example, a visit to castles in the Loire and Rhine valleys or a tour of interesting cities on the Danube or a cruise on the Erie Canal.
They also determine the routes of popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition in which people wake up on Easter night in some exposed place to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but they may just as well be pre-Christian festivals of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter vigils on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, when the congregation often erupts into a celebration at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands swam there, arrived or were carried there by wind or sea currents.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to cover this distance, and the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal in the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos Islands, a number of mammals have been brought including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, which means that the sun will not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to observe the aurora Borealis, as the sky will be dark more or less all the time.
Because these areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is usually not a problem, you will be able to enjoy the view of the stars.
Japan's work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
A businessman's standard dress is a suit, and co-workers address each other by their surnames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is key, rather than praising individual achievements, group efforts are emphasized.
Workers must obtain the approval of supervisors for each of their decisions and are expected to obey the instructions of their superiors without question.
