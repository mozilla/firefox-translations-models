What will he do? CSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the pastry shop
The new councillors of the capital from the ČSSD will apparently have to overcome a certain language barrier to understand their old ODS colleagues in the Prague Council and the council.
The daily Aktuálně.cz "tested" members of the new ČSSD council, as they know the notoriously established slang that originated at the town hall during the last years, when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary introduced by Prague's political elite during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bém describes some of the most famous figures, situations and cases in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councillors did not understand well-known concepts.
At least that's what he says.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I am more of a newcomer to Prague politics," Lukáš Kaucký, a councillor for culture, responded to the "Godfather" glossary test.
And while he is a political veteran, Councillor Karel Březina responded in kind.
Like the term "golf hole."
"It's the only expression you give me, which I sometimes use."
"Otherwise, I don't generally accept slang."
From the vocabulary, whose terms were published by Aktuálně.cz in June this year before the ODS election congress, the editorial board selected six examples, mainly those notoriously associated with the Prague Municipality.
The Socialists were to explain the terms "Voldemort," "the biggest golf hole in Prague," "go to the pastry shop," "the dull neck," "the brood of the capital" and "bubs."
The trio of the councillors agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is expected to head Prague's education in the future - at first pledged the interview, but later did not answer the phone.
Fifth Councilman Petr Dolínek rejected the test outright.
"I don't discuss these things at all, and I'm not going to evaluate the way the Civic Democrats are amused."
"I'm now discussing how we're going to get along in our programs," he responded.
As has already been said, Councillor Lukáš Kaucký would not have discriminated in the headline above that he was talking about an influential businessman and friend of the ex-mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
"Voldemort" Kaucki means nothing to him, and the only date he correctly estimated in the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague."
"That's the Blanka tunnel," Kaucký says, adding immediately: "But I know that from the newspapers."
"I'll have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
The golf hole is then deciphered as the Blanka tunnel to the administration not only by the matador Karel Březina, but also by the councillor for the environment, Lukáš Plachý.
Both Social Democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lukas Plachému is familiar with where to find this character - they suspect the meaning of the term "go to the pastry shop."
"I think that means going to a Prague business," Plachý is close to deciphering that it is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
In consultation with Březina, he recalls that he drew the knowledge from the newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the trainees of the test, there is no such concurrent vocabulary of slang terms.
"I joined my colleagues, too, but it looks like we really don't have anything like that."
"We call ourselves more names, sometimes abbreviations and misconceptions of names are used," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD, Petr Hulínský, whom the partisans have dubbed Hulda.
"I was called Birch at the school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," confesses his own nickname Karel Březina.
The daily Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and is working.
Councillor Weinert is for the partisans of Grandpa or less amicably the Old Man, deputy Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to the party's sponsorship fraud before the election, is nicknamed "Igracek" by some of his colleagues.
The nicknames are also the only thing the Social Democrats in intra-party talk admit.
Hulínský is said to be glad not to hear Hulda, but Aktuálně.cz also noted another nickname of this Prague chairman.
"Dr. of the baton law" is said to be reminded that Petr Hulínský received his JUDr. degree from the Bratislava Police Academy.
Government wants to limit the torture of 'witches', issue a brochure
The women declared to be the Witches in Burkina Faso have several common traits.
Rather, they belong to the older generation, they cannot get involved in the work for medical reasons, for example, they are single and have no children.
The one who "rises" with the witch is sent to isolation so as not to endanger the rest of the village.
"The man will rarely make this fate."
"Joung healthy women don't even apply because they help at work and give birth to children," describes the nun, who takes care of more than a hundred women in a special home in a special home, as their community has expelled from its ranks.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual "social measure."
She issued an information booklet to help reduce the witch hunt.
But there is a catch.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the Die Standard newspaper pointed out the disadvantage of the written education.
Blaming for witchcraft is also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, who is adjacent to Burkina Faso, 72, died last week after being tortured by three women and two men to her by kerosene and setting fire to her.
The case was reported by the BBC.
The perpetrators claim that this was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, the woman's oil, which is used for ritual riches, ignited.
He said he flared up after the group wanted to "kick up the evil spirit" from the woman.
The insulation of "witches" is supported by people, regardless of the level of educational attainment.
Der Standard quoted the 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying: "The potholes of human souls have always posed a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the Witch Hunt is being tempered by the government, the president himself participated in Gambia last year.
"Gambi's President Jamm, after the death of his aunt, unleashed a massive witch-hunt that was supposedly supposed to be involved in her death and seek to use black magic to kill the president himself."
"He invited shamans from nearby Guinea to help, who, accompanied by police, soldiers, soldiers, and the president's personal security guard, forcibly removed randomly selected men and women from the Gambian villages to the President's Farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, imprisoned people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused bowel and kidney problems.
Two imprisoned stay on the farm did not survive.
After international pressure, nearly 1,000 of those imprisoned were eventually set free.
Bakala's tenant: He drowns in a stove, higher rent signed
The older stocued man stepped out of the door of the client centre of RPG Byty Byty "uhlobaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental flats in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm, he carried a folder and new lease agreements for three apartments: his, his daughter and his son, who is serving his sentence.
All three of them were just getting the rent up.
Instead of 3,500 a month, the son will pay CZK 4100 for a second-class 2+1 apartment from next year.
"And it's not hot water, and petrama (a solid-fuel pate) has to be heated," the man shows a finger in his son's new contract, for which he has a power of attorney.
"But I signed it," he explains, half-inhabited, half-resigned.
The civic association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new lease conditions as "incorrect and immoral," advises the tenants not to sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when they will publish a guide on how to proceed against them.
But the man is just waving his hand at it.
"One says it, the other says it," he frowns.
Ostrava is becoming a big laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, a large majority of flats, which still have non-market rent in the Czech Republic, are expected.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The Havířovská waiting room RPG is one of the four in Ostrava and is already full at 9 a.m. on Tuesday.
Next to the door is a security guard from the security agency and a caller.
"Nove 2011", the special button on its touchscreen is on.
One tap and a slip of the machine is taken out of the machine with the number.
You can't even read "157" and your figure is already beeping on the big display under the waiting room ceiling.
You're up in half a second.
The rent is asked to the older married couple after a while, but the rush in the waiting room is clearly not involved in the new rents at all.
Most people came to solve common problems as usual - requests for repairs, insurance claims and the like.
In Ostrava, letters with new lease contracts are received in the post office boxes by tenants of most of the 44,000 flats of the RPG portfolio since about mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes to increase the rent by 15 to 38 percent in their letters.
The special counter to the new rents was opened at the client centre on November 18.
"It runs for over a week, so it's only in the run," the desk worker replies after a moment's hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
The deregulation and the Bacala's former mining apartments are a local innovate-flammable subject.
He was quite loudly picked up in the run-up to the election by the deputy speaker of parliament and Ostrava-born Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD, and even now the local paper is full of it.
"Twenty-years after them, I want a new floor."
"Nor the "they've changed the toilet board" was replaced by the man in question.
The most recent, according to the workers, is the pensioners, to see if they will get a discount on the rent if they sign on time, as the RPG promises them in a special offer.
A half-relief discount on the February rent will also be given to other tenants who will sign the new contract by December 15.
The Havering "deregulation" counter, however, is certainly not overwhelmed with questions.
"Octay's 360 clients, only about forty to fifty people were here because of the 2011 rent," the workers at the counter estimate.
At the same time, RPG proposes on the web and its bulletin boards for individual contract negotiations where it is needed.
However, if neither party agrees to the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"This is not about threatening, but about information about only a possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," the RPG points out on its website.
"No one is going to sue here," thinks one of the RPG Byty's workers, and the man on the street in front of the client center partly agrees with her.
"I have a pension of 13 grand and I have five grand left to eat, I don't have the gives to sue," he claims.
But the worker is insecure afterwards.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek tells them in the media not to sign, so people are probably waiting," he muses.
The regulation of rents ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byta, increasing them is an economic necessity.
"The current rent is still not even above necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing stock," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, that the just-anchmarked tenant's accused neglect of the housing stock is the main reason for the increase in rents, according to the homeowners.
While in the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPGs could invest four billion in dwellings in flats, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
Meanwhile, the large-scale screen hanging by the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the mining waiting room is repeated with several red-released information.
"The rent increase in 2011 is 15% and less affects 31,200 flats, that's more than 90% of RPG flats."
"And it will always be the most of £7.50 per square metre per month," he will appear on the screen.
Only 400 flats from the RPG portfolio will be increased by 38 per cent.
"In these cases, it is an increase from an extremely small amount of 19.66 CZK per square metre," RPG points out.
For 2600 flats, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cut out the rents in leaps and bounds, but will be distributed over four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the rent increase (see chart) will be put back into the apartments by the company, mainly in heat savings - new windows and insulation.
They are to be given to them pre-emptively to sign an agreement to increase rents.
The offices also include a kindergarten, the architects understood
The Avriopoint Administrative Building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would have expected him to also hide a mini-chamber with everything that goes with it - with colorful walls, imaginative furniture, a pile of toys and even a mini-humour playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October of last year, it has been visited by the children of the employees of Arch.Design.
The architheumatia-architectural-architetonic company Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of important Brno buildings emerged, counted on the space for its corporate mini-detail since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
She employs nearly 90 people, mostly at the age of the Babyboom, and she cared that the women of the designer and the architect could quickly return to work.
Along with the possibility of part-time work, the kindergarten is a benefit offered by Arch.Design to its employees under the Social Programme.
Builders and architects have the opportunity to combine a demanding job with caring for a child.
The mini-chool was invented by the employees of Arch.Design themselves and, with the support of the management, they managed to obtain a subsidy from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company mini-chairs are funded by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the grant funding (subsidies of 2, 8 mil. CZK) could purchase the equipment and equipment and provide qualified staff and operations for two years.
After the financial grant has been exhausted (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to operate a mini-chamber at its own expense for 3 years.
The project took one year to prepare and Economy Rating helped significantly with the application for the subsidy.
The care is provided by qualified staff, the children are cared for by a nurse and a school teacher, so children can attend the kindergarten without age restrictions, yet most of them are over the age of 3 years.
As it is a "minor-wheeler", only 5 children can be present at the same time, but more will take turns during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible according to the needs of the parents, and the children of all employees have the same right to use the nursery regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the programme content in the mini-detrad is comparable to the pre-school framework programme.
Children not only play here, but are also provided with quality teaching - from basic cognition to school desks, the English language is also taught.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys, inspiring games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and stress situations are eliminated with the delayed pick-up of kindergartens from their parents' workplace.
Parents thus use their working hours more productively.
No wonder the employee's naturally loyal relationship - the employer - is created here.
Arch.Design thus joined the Czech companies that offer a significant benefit in the recruitment of new employees, are friendly to the family and through this program reinforced personnel marketing.
The Bone House is still fascinating after 100 years. Take a look at the interiors from Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the staircase resembles the backbone of a dinosaur, and the balconies are an open fish mouth.
Such is the Casa Batlló in Barcelona by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi.
The house, thanks to its organic shapes, earned the house the Bone House.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, tiled fragments and mosaics, a chehes-like facade and ubiquitous soft curves are all typical of the Art Nouveau by Antoni Gaudi's Art Nouveau.
The front of the house is played out by dreamy lines, tender colours and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
In the detailed observation, you can see the geometricity, rhythm and precisely thought-out order.
At night, the entire facade of the houses is even more dramatic, illuminated to be enhanced by the impression of the gleam of colour.
The culling and twisting of shapes is equally appearing in the interiors.
The wood in the waves replicates the window frames, the railing, the decorative elements of the door, the peepholes and the molders.
The Batlló house, which is located in the Eixample district on the bustling shopping street Passeig de Grácia č. 43, was created by the reconstruction of the 1877 house by architect Emilio Salo Cortese.
The renovation took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, had originally insisted on demolishing the old structure and building a brand new one, but soon adopted Gaudí's idea of an unusual and cheaper rebuilding.
The apartment house Casa Batlló, however, was not proposed by Antoni Gaudí himself.
He was co-operated with architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his design board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of the property were created and the use of the mosaic on the facade.
A number of other creators and artists also worked on the facade.
Working together on the designs of the house Casa Batlló kicked off Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudi.
Yujol was involved in the construction of Gaudi's house Casa Milá as well as Güell Park, which houses the next works of Gaudi.
From the locals, the house soon after completion, thanks to its organic shapes, earned the nickname "House of Bones."
Others, for the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began to call it a "mighty house."
It is also said that at the top of the building the sword of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia, is depicted.
The hidden religious motifs also contain other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaudí designed for her time a unique system of central heating with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
Bizarre may seem to be their forty-five-degree gradient.
In the creation of Gaudí absolutely disregarded the building regulations of the time and did not allow himself to be constrained by them.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained a building permit from the city, but the data provided by him were so vague that two years later, when completed, the city council was horrified by the result and asked for redress.
Councillors resented, for example, the fact that the construction had also interfered with the pillar's sidewalk and the public sidewalk.
There was never a correction, on the contrary: only fifteen days after the city's call from the city district, Josep Batlló applied (and successfully obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved into the lower levels.
In the second-floor gallery there was a formal salon and a bedroom and a private part of the apartment on the third floor.
The ground floor was rented out to a jewelry store.
The entire six-story house is cut through a staircase to climb up to the rooftop terrace itself.
The essential elements of the redevelopment were the abolition of all the right angles and straight lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting space.
The social part can be completely connected by the opening of the parlour doors, and the larger company can communicate comfortably to each other without also preserving the privacy needed for more intimate interviews.
The house with the Gaudí reconstruction was given an unconventional roofing and two extra floors in addition to the new facade.
It is also impressive to Gauna's play with light, blue and white glazed tiles to be lined with the interior courtyard.
The game of two colours delivers maximum light on all floors of the house.
Simply betting on the principle that the white reflected light more than the dark, which absorbs the sun's rays.
The Casa Batlló, which was included in the Unesco World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
On the first floor of the house, the spaciousest and most ophazes apartment is made available to the public.
The owners did not oppose the move until 2002, to mark the 100th anniversary of the famous creator's 100th anniversary.
They remained at the tours, finding that it was a very advantageous venture and, in addition, extended the tours to include joint and attic spaces, including the roof terrace.
Admission to the monument is by no means insignificant, at €16.50 and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have a 20% discount.
The sum greatly exceeds the price of admission to other Gaudí's buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the true atmosphere of the house with the dragon's turrets, you have to make a quick friend with one of the residents of the apartment building and visit it right at home.
How to choose a mattress and a grate: women have different requirements than men
Not the fancy bed frame, but the quality of the light-heading, the mattress and the grate, give the base of a really good bed.
However, they must be complemented in a harmonious way to suit a particular user.
The choice is made by a lot of things, from weight, height, age, health and gender of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior to which the mattresses and grate are purchased.
A typical example?
For example, there are no suitable latex mattresses for weekend cottages where they don't regularly heat up because they are slower to "warm up."
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than a standard polyurethane mattress.
At the same time, they are required to be turned over regularly.
For if they don't have a lot of ventilation ducts in their core, and they're still lying on the solid, they hold moisture: mold could appear underneath.
The choice is also decided by a custom.
Those who have spent a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with a softening layer are often used, will find it hard to feel comfortable on the low and hard surface.
"Perhaps all the hockey players who were coming back from the NHL complained about not sleeping here."
"For their battered shoulders, heels, and hips, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam."
"Suchs are recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they misread "information" from the joints and the skin," explains Sylva Hadamczik, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
To many hockey players, as well as other customers, that's why years ago, she was looking for a lazy foam mattress.
"Today it's cool, the suitable mattresses have Tempur, the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be the NHL guy to appreciate the lazy foam.
This "miracle" works simply.
It optimizes its stiffness and the shape according to the absorbed heat, or adapts to your warm body.
There's no pressure, you're not going to turn over at night like you're after a tough match.
You just get a better night's sleep.
The lining foam also acts as a protection against bedsores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the foot length to your height, which is usually about 21 to 34 cm.
Both the man and the woman with a height of about 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be at the double bed of 90 cm, i.e. 180 cm.
For separate beds, such as singles, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For comfort and a possible visit.
"Otherwise, the bed width rule is simple: when lying on your back, you should keep your hands comfortably slightly bent at the elbow," says Ing. Helena Prokopová, guild of the Guild of upholsteriers and decorators, who has been involved in the issue of healthy sleeping and the ergonomics of furniture for many years and has been lecturing it at vocational schools.
For a double bed, everyone needs their own grate and mattress, but here you are careful when shopping to align to align the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, you will have no choice but to mount the grids to different heights, but you may not succeed at any bed frame.
Foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring skeleton of at least 15, of which at least three centimetres are counted on the moulding and raising layer.
"When you touch your hands or the touching down on the mattress, you definitely must not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grate.
The all-rounded beds, when the mattresses and the base are like the fused siam twins, have no business being in the bedrooms.
Mattresses are poorly ventilated, their cover cannot be washed, which is now common.
And because we normally sweat 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat per night, it is clear that after five to seven years of the mattress, it will begin to resemble one large (and clogged) sieve.
So, too, do experts reject advertising slogans on the lifetime of mattresses for up to 25 years, or even life-long guarantees.
But everything has its buts.
And that's why the desk from the vendors: for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and work, do not give up the sensible coating, but add a mattress guard that you can easily remove and wash.
Although mattress covers are now commonly made to produce with mattresses, so that after unbuckling we get two parts (very important for washing and washing machine size!), the handling of larger types (and in one person) could resemble a lightweight battle in the ring with a heavy one when you take the take of the shooting.
Do you have a solid slab in bed instead of a grate?
Never!
Maximum for a one-night-day-bound bed.
However, you still provide the plate (if it already has them) with ventilation holes and use a mattress with a spring skeleton and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in sachets (Taschenfederkern) and a buckling layer.
The polyurethane mattress does not belong on such a base.
For non-catching laminated slats with 14 to 18 lamellas, latex or sandwich mattresses will be suitable (like a combination of latex and coconut), but you are always worth grind with more slats, 28 or more, where the lamellas in the lining area are doubled and their stiffness can be regulated.
The positioning slats do not include mattresses with spring skeleton because they do not respond to the positioning.
In addition to setting the stiffness of the slats, you can also indulge in the so-called shoulder cradle.
It is a special attachment of the slats, which allows you to push, or even tilt the slat, so that the sleeper's shoulder is pretty much "fighted."
For men who have "the stripes all over their backs," an important thing.
It is even remembered by mattress manufacturers, who in the "men's" have started to use a softening zone just in the shoulder area.
Women also remember - they are given a softer surface in places of the hips.
For the most demanding customers, the wings or platelet grates with so-called multitorous suspension are designed.
The pressure is decomposed into more points and the voltage is reduced.
But beware, once you use the wrong pillow (large and "suffered" grate), most "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is simple: the cushion is supposed to be supported by the head and the toes to shoulder only to relax their shoulder muscles.
It is recommended to be the appropriate size 50 x 60 cm, which is preferred in Scandinavia, for example.
When lying on the side, the cushion should be balancing (along with the shoulder cradle of the grate or the softened zone in the mattress) the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have something to do with the original mattresses stuffed with grasses.
Their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least an admixture.
The trend is simply for the bio mattresses.
The raw materials from the oil, which are made of polyurethane foam, are replaced by natural oils, such as jumping and soy.
Soyya is used by all the well-known manufacturers.
"Bio for the mattresses means that the core is made of a material of purely natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers, one of the first being aloe vera.
But you can also indulge in micro-chancellations to release the fresh scent of the forest or lavender.
There is also a division for men and women.
While the man is "cooled" by the plant extract from the birch to absorb the heat and cool the body for the mattress coating, the women's inverts of "heating" inks.
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, making the weaker sexer warmer.
Today's favorites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with a broken cellular structure, making it breath more breathable than conventional polyurethane and offering better elasticity.
By combining various stiffness of cold foam and "lazy" foam, multi-zone mattresses are created, which know exactly where the head, loins and heels should be.
You will pay for a quality mattress from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those that meet the health parameters tend to have a lower VAT rate, they are taken as medical aids.
He was the first to achieve this advantage in the Czech Republic by Gumotex.
Saving on a mattress and a grate is not easy.
Sometimes you can use, for example, the actions of manufacturers or dealers that offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers a Duofreeze mattress with Memory memory foam to the coating for 11,990 crowns.
The second, however, can already be purchased for free.
The era of lazy, or viscole-elastic foams with an open cellular structure and a high density, kick-started Tempur material at the "space" pace.
It was originally created as NASA material because the astronauts were exposed to enormous overload at the in-earnings.
Tempur softens in the warmth, while it is reinforced in the cold.
It adapts to the warm human body perfectly and sets out its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the emergence of bedsores, but also to increase comfort in the sleep.
Viskoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, such as special cushions under the feet under the feet and the venous system.
Domestic manufacturers use eucathm C or Twinsaver, for example, and the like.
Instruments to track people want more and more parents, so they want to keep an eye on their children
Fear for their own child is driving more and more people to the idea of watching through GPS.
The system originally designed to search for cars can also track the movement of people, thus helping, for example, in such cases as the disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is about the size of a matchbox yet, but it can soon be only as big as a watch.
A number of people were startled by the case of the missing Annie and they began to look for the means of better protection for their children.
Even at the cost of invading their privacy.
"We try to tell everyone that it is not about spying, but another means of reducing the likelihood of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment to the Czech market.
"I admit that in some case, such devices may be misused, like when they put in the bag to someone who doesn't know about it, but we haven't encountered a case like this before."
"Most of the time, customers actually buy it for safety reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know for what purpose the "box" is for and how it is used in the event of an emergency.
The child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not want to wear anything similar, he will simply get rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity in how to deliberately lose some things when they don't want to be in control."
"Large expectations were previously raised by their parents' mobile phones, which, however, can be turned off just like these tracking devices," says Bočková.
It is also questionable whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
"As for the upcoming kidnapping, the perpetrator will virtually always ensure that the child has no electronics on him that could give away his or her location."
"Now it's the phone."
"When the tracking devices start to expand, they will look for them as well, as their sale will certainly be supported by a massive advertisement."
"In that case, the criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," the psychologist says.
However, he admits that a similar device can help in the event of a paedophile assault.
According to Robert Čech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, even when the tracking device is immediately destroyed after the attack is attacked, its presence can help.
The device can be set to be sent to the positioning periodically after a certain period of time."
"If it is damaged, at least the last location of the person concerned will be available."
"The more expensive devices are also built into by the tilometers, so even if one just slipped and lay still, the device sends out a warning immediately with a location," the Czech says.
According to him, a similar service can be done by smart mobile phones with navigation, where you can upload special software.
The problem with the current surveillance units is that they are either devices similar to pendants the size of a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
It is always the risk of losing them.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, this is why a device that looks like a regular digital watch is now being tested.
"That's the biggest advantage is that any aggressor doesn't need to know the tracking device at all."
"Or he'll recognize them after a while and that can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether the tracking devices are developed for bracelets or pendants, they will still use the same technology used to guard the cars.
It is a combination of positioning through the GPS system (which is used by common autoccupations) and the mobile phone function that reports the car's current position.
The army has a fervor of incendiaries that they would arm the Czech Republic. But it will only last two years
The Czech army bought 445 kilometres of cords to be used to set off the explosives.
Already last year, the Ministry of Defence delivered 224 kilometres of cords to the warehouses.
The army has supplies for 225 years.
The problem is that the shelf life of the caucus is two, four years at the most.
The army bought the fuse lines from the stock-based STV Group, a. s. for CZK 40 million.
The general staff, in the justification for buying such a huge number of incendiary troughs, wrote off the MF DNES that the soldiers in training consumed 60 kilometres of fittings a year.
However, calculations of the army bomb squad, which were approached by MF DNES, it follows that then all generals, the command of the army, secretaries or cleaners would have to undergo a very intense pyrotechnicic training each year.
Defence Minister Alexander Vondra and the commander of the army, Vlastimil Pick, included.
Only in this way could the annual consumption of the army be justified by sixty kilometers of fittings.
This length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it did, the army's supplies would last for more than a decade.
If, on the other hand, it would be true that a basic training of every new professional is enough for at most two metres of fittings, as the experts say, the military's fresh purchase has secured supplies for the aforementioned 225 years - even with increased consumption of the engineers or special forces.
Soldiers of the Rapid Deployment Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra personally that they had almost no rounds of handguns, so even the shooting for lack of money is limited.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"It doesn't make me think they're buying such a large number of fuses repeatedly."
"But it's their decision, and I'm sure they know what they'll care for."
"For us, the army is a good customer who we try to accommodate as traders," says STV Group business manager Jan Děcký.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek justifies hundreds of kilometres of purchased cordage by the fact that the army will have supplies of this "mony" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group speaks only of the four-year life of the fighter and the police or army bomb squad for even only two years.
"With the perfect storage, it can be the four," says one of them, who as a soldier does not want to disclose a name because of the military's criticism.
After a lifetime, each ammunition must be carefully tested to see if it is still reliable and does not endanger the soldiers' life.
However, these tests are not free and cost extra money.
Another of the Ministry's argument is the quantitative discount on the 445-kilometer incendiary cords.
"We were sixty percent less than last year's van two hundred and forty-four kilometers," the Pejšek spokesperson relays the position of the Defence Department's buyers.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of the launching cords of police bomb squad, which liquidates World War II ammunition or the one in the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 metres for several years.
And the police always ordering an amount to consume this ammunition before the end of their life.
It has worked for her to the safety of the bomb squad, and she can also get more modern and therefore more reliable cords in a flexible way.
The Ministry of Defence already has considerable difficulty in eliminating tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact, when the 200,000-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing to campaign on the Rhine.
The Czech one, according to the bomb squad, which was approached by MF DNES, is the same problem in a few years: it will eliminate hundreds of kilometres of old matches that the "bottom" is now buying.
To this day I draw from the contacts I have gained thanks to the competition
The winning place in the Entrepreneur of the Year competition helped Lukáš Pytloun in the sale of the franchise to his hotel.
The winner of the previous year's Entrepreneur of the Year competition was the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story is like a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad he realized that Liberec lacked quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From savings from foreign jobs and a bank loan, he bought a half-defected house with five flats.
For a student of his third year of college at the time, it was a great courage.
"He did not give me the ratio between the quality and price of accommodation with us, so that I would not try to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began to be leased to foreign workers.
He invested all the profits back into a house, which he gradually converted into a 54-bed guesthouse.
Since then, in seven years of business, he has gradually opened four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of these until recently was the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, there was another, of the same quality.
"We are currently signing a contract with the hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, where we sold our franchise concept and other interested in the hotel franchise Pytloun is applying," says last year's number one tradesman.
"And in this sale of the hotel's license to operate the hotel, it was the victory in the Entrepreneur of the Year competition that contributed to the interest," adds Pytloun, appreciatively.
The victory brought him more acquaintance and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the streets, they often congratulated me afterwards, and I have to say it was nice," he recalls.
Participation in the competition is definitely recommended by all those who are trying to do something.
It is not even necessary to win, any visibility is good.
He says to this day he draws on contacts and connections he might not have gotten into otherwise.
"I started trading with some of the contest because of the competition."
The fame associated with the success, according to him, also fared a bit on each employee.
And that he's in his 70s.
"I see more loyalty and pride in participating in something that has gained widespread recognition."
"This is far from my personal achievement, it is the result of a good job of all of us together."
"Only my name is pushed to the fore," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly today.
I wish your successor a quieter year than we had at the Farmet
The euphoria of the victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
However, thanks to the player's purposefulness, Farmet has had a worse time.
For the award for first place in the last year's Vodafone Firma of the Year competition, the owner of Farmet, Karel Žďárský, came to the owner of the company in the Slavonic House last year.
The jury at the time praised the efforts through which he built a small tool shop in Česká Skalice into a company with hundreds of millions of dollars of turnovers.
"I can say that the award has been cheered not only by me, but by all my team-workers and has increased our confidence for the competition match," says last year's winner today.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet, there was a desire to do something useful.
So, when the state offered the father of Karel Žďárský to rent a small workshop as compensation for the communists' confiscated property, he did not hesitate for a long time, he refused a career at the company where he worked at the time, and he and a few friends around his dad started a plastic bath company.
Soon later, they specialized in the presses of vegetable oil.
After 18 years, it became the largest automotive press manufacturer in Central Europe.
The company got more awareness even among the unprofessional public after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers start to perceive the Farmet brand significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they were working with a company that achieved greater success in their country," says Karel Žďárský.
But the past year was not just a sign of euphoria from the winners in the Farmet.
The awards were based on the company's economic results until 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And it was 2009 that was the toughest year for the sale of engineering goods.
A crisis was at the height, not so much to the attention of citizens, but companies were already stopping their investment projects and began to cut back on purchases of new machinery and technology.
"Of course, this situation has not escaped us."
"Revenues fell by 40 percent, we had to limit production and there were also redundancies," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must occasionally be able to take such unpopular measures.
But they handled the situation and kept the company in profit, albeit smaller than before the crisis.
But what they did not discount at Farmet is the investment in research and development.
"We built a research and training centre from the subsidies, we strengthened the presentation at international fairs, we won the main awards in domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
All indications are that the crisis is behind them.
Sales are back to grow, and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of winning, but in a quieter atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
A poll that removes nonsensical regulations
The poll on the Absurdity of the Year is part of the business race for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical regulations have already been repealed.
The infamous winner of the next year's Absurdito of the Year poll was the obligation to wear documents to the office that are also accessible to officials online.
More than a third of the less than 4,000 voting members decided.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper extract from the Commercial Register, even if the official can obtain it with two clicks from the mouse.
The poll will change that.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the Commercial Register during checks on the payee of the insurance premiums," said ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buraňová.
A light on all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and the nonsensical ones to be abolished is the point of the Absurdito of the Year competition.
It is part of the business race organised by Hospodářské noviny for the fourth time this year and is increasingly popular among the public.
If some three thousand voting participants participated in the vote last year, there were already nearly four thousand of them this year.
And no wonder, all sorts of legal obligations, which only serves to delay the business, there is still plenty and enough for us.
"For example, in the number of documents for tax returns, we are at the top of the world," notes Karel Havlíček from the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Trades Employers of the Czech Republic.
Business simplification has become a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improving.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranked 74th in terms of conditions for doing business, eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and is conducted annually in the same scenario.
Anyone can sign up for administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, when the competition is due.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is then selected by the organizer of the competition for the "anti-pren" and lets the public vote on it over the internet at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
More than a hundred were entered for this year's poll, or 105 regulations and regulations that lacked meaning.
Tips were sent by entrepreneurs, as well as professional unions and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, among the nominees, there was, for example, a requirement that cars for motorway and express road maintenance be paid for toll, or for entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets to paint every two years.
A list of this year's seven designs is published on the competition's website.
The announcement of the competition, which takes place in early November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the hapenning, which is regularly attended by the personalities of political and social life.
This year, for example, this climax of the competition was assisted by Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Craft Professionals of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot function where the state throws business to entrepreneurs, so my goal is to cancel at least three dozen paragraphs every year, which today only unnecessarily complicate business," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
The attempt to repeal senseless regulations does not come to nothing.
In 2007, people were most bothered by the obligation to report the entrepreneur to the trade office three days in advance at the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with the stall to the exhibition or the fair.
This obligation was removed by an amendment to the Trade Licensing Act.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was the report to the employment office for its foreign employee for a business trip of up to 30 days, was removed by the so-called Green Card Act.
And third time, all the charm.
The absurdity of the year of 2009 was the regulation of physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two treadmills in the office.
This has been eased by a Ministry of Health decree this year - the obligation to have a refrigerator has fallen by the wayside.
The new category awards socially responsible firms
It is evaluated by environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects.
A new feature in this year's fifth edition of the competition of Hospodářské noviny is a category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote a reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take into account the environmental impacts of their business and support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, which is the promoter and guarantor of the competition as well as the rebel of the year competition.
Companies have entered this first year of this special subcategory of the main Vodafone Firma of the Year of the Year 2010 competition, for which success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspirational and would be published on a separate article.
Although the subject of its activities is diametrically opposed to one's activity, support and consideration can be considered as common denominators of their endeavours.
In one case, it concerns, for example, disabled people and, elsewhere, for example, the personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the 14 nationwide finalists were, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees, who then take part in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice Region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund sponsoring handicapped children for seventeen years.
Its disabled employees are again cared for by the Poděbrad paper mill, which has more than 70 percent of them, which therefore won the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and placed third in the Vodafone Firm of the Year competition.
In Olomouck, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which introduced flexible working hours, was also reduced to an average 35 hours per week, but without proportionally reduced pay.
The title was also awarded to her by the jury for her preference buying from Czech producers, supporting civic activities in the nearby area and saving the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration have the least possible impact on the environment," explains Managing Director Miluše Ryznarová.
Responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí Region, for its part, thinks about the health of its employees and has acquired ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by a local sheltered workshop at its corporate events.
"In addition, we support the People in Need Foundation, which specifically helps the local Romani community," says Ondřej Suchý, a representative of the company.
Last but not least, the activity of the company Laundry and Cleaning from the Karlovy Vary Region, which contributes to their employees' supplementary pension insurance in the form of premium bonuses, is also worth mentioning.
"At our place, we give contributions to food, transport, upskilling and recreation," says Josef Strapáč from the Bruntál construction company Czasch, winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
The Responsible Company of the Year category was automatically entered by all the regional finalists of the Vodafone Firma of the Year competition, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer no later than 15 August.
The incomplete or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were then removed from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the contestants' representatives did not answer the questions, they were unable to participate in the Responsible Company of the Year contest, but are not disqualified from the "main" competition Vodafone Company of the Year."
"A separate registration only for this competition is not possible as it is a sub-category of the main Firma of the Year competition," explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen, police arrested during a public tender
The Land Fund building in Pilsen in recent days has been arrested by anti-corruption police.
The jilezka was deployed by the detectives to a local businessman in the media sphere and a real estate trader, Luboš G.
He allegedly attempted to manipulate the ongoing tender to settle the restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition would be acquired by a specific bidder.
He was to pay Luboš G. half a million crowns for it.
"For now, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for the offense of scheming in a public contract and in a public tender," Antonie Zelená, the head of the Plzeň prosecutor's office, told Právo, noting that further details could not be provided with regard to the ongoing investigation.
The 46-year-old businessman was released by police officers after 24 hours.
The way he could have influenced the public tender is only speculated, given the minimum of official information.
Land Fund spokeswoman Lubomíra Černá, told Právo that police officers were actually arrested at the secluded workplace in Pilsen during a public tender.
"It was a client, not our employee," she clarified.
The public tender is the correct name, according to the Black, "The invitation to bid for the land transfer claims under the Land Act" and takes place when more eligible applicants are interested in the land offered.
"These persons shall offer, as part of the call, the higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the claims offered, the ranking of the acquirers is determined and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who offered the highest claims," the fund's spokesperson explained.
Luboš G. apparently had information about who entered the challenge, and because he is also an authorized person, having bought up a number of restitution claims, he offered the bidder of the land not to take part in the contest.
For that, he probably collected severance pay.
That would explain that he had such a large sum of money when he was detained.
Luboš G. had high-standard contacts at the PF in Pilsen in the past.
He was in the case of former PF chief Václav Sankot, who was being prosecuted for issuing land in the replacement restitution to which a decision on the location of the construction had already been issued.
It was then that Luboš G. acquired from the fund, for example, land for the construction of public roads, specifically the site where the access road to the Borská Fields industrial zone was to be built.
He later traded them very profitably with the Municipality to a house in the historic centre of the city itself, which was worth much higher.
At the time, the town hall had to accept it, because otherwise it would have put the construction at risk by blocking the land.
Housewives pay hundreds a month for housing
From January, households will have to pay extra not only for all types of energy, but also for aqueous and sewerage, heat supplies and rents will rise somewhere.
As a result, families will have to withdraw from their wallets of up to hundreds of crowns more per month from January than they do now.
Electricity will go up to 4.6 per cent more expensive for electricity, gas will be about 2 per cent more expensive, up to a tenth in some cities you will have to pay extra for water supplies and in many places the supply of central heat will also be undercut.
The increase in electricity should be a year for households in flats for hundreds of crowns more than it is now.
Power prices have been lowered by all main suppliers, so a significant increase in support of renewable energy production, especially photovoltaics, is to blame.
Gas will become more expensive slightly, but at a time when people are the most heating up and have the highest consumption.
They must therefore also count on an extra hundreds of crowns a year.
While electricity and gas will become more expensive across the country, the change in the price of central heating varies from place to seat.
The price increase is mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay an extra CZK 50 per month for central heating from January, and families in Liberec pay more than CZK 1,000 a year.
Prague residents, for their part, are at risk of making them more than 9 percent more expensive to aqueous and stodgy, if the city increases rent from infrastructure.
If the rent is unchanged, the Roasted 6.8 percent will be paid.
However, the price in Prague will still be among the lower in the national comparison.
In the north of Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, the water and stodgy are expected to increase by 7.4 percent.
For example, the rental price of 450,000 rental apartments, where regulations expire from January, may rise significantly.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 flats in Ústí nad Labem, intends to increase the rent by up to one hundred percent from January.
Those who do not agree to the new rent level are to be put in court by the company.
Regulated rents, paid by people in around 300,000 apartments, could rise by as much as ten percent next year.
Czech children are drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally even a better brand of whiskey stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks, after which the drink is most often ended up in the care of doctors by drunks who were less than fifteen years old.
The exception is not children who are treated for the monkey in the hospital repeatedly.
This follows on from the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases in the income of children's hospitals ward.
"Some beers or wines are completely non-fashionable, because it takes a long time to get drunk with them."
"The trend is definitely hard alcohol," Luděk Pelikán, head of the children's department at the Hořovice Hospital in Central Bohemia, told Právo.
"If they manage to pull the bottle out of Daddy's closet, it's a whisky, but otherwise, fernet and vodka predominate."
"Vodka has the advantage of pouring it into the juice and not feeling so much of it," the chief surgeon explained.
He is also supported by the spokesperson of the University Hospital Motol, Eva Jurin.
"It's fernet or rum the most important thing."
"This is modern alcohol today especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was a slivovitz that they brought from home," Jurinova said.
According to the head of Pelikán, 13 or 14-year-old female drinkers are a relatively common occurrence at hospital reception.
In front of Hořovice, where he has been since this year, he worked for ten years on pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances bring undergraceful schoolchildren from a wide area.
"One girl lay with us about four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12, when she was brought to us with a blood alcohol level of 3.5 extra alcohol in combination with ecstasy," the doctor said, describing a particularly serious case.
"She was at the Exhibition Grounds in Holešovice for a dance party."
"What's interesting is that her mother didn't find it strange at all that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the chief said.
It is the lack of interest of parents or even their considerable tolerance for drinking their own offspring that is considered the main cause of the growing children's drink.
However, addiction in the true sense of the word cannot be discussed in children.
"Under the term alcoholic, the term of alcohol is several years of chronic addiction to alcohol with all the phenomena that are of this, and that is not the case with children."
"For those who use alcohol repeatedly, it tends to be rather a characteristic family-social background," explained the head doctor Pelikán.
According to Jurin's spokeswoman, around forty drunk children were hospitalized at the pediatric clinic in Motol this year by mid-November.
However, only those with severe intoxications that had to stay in the hospital get into the statistics.
The child drunks who are taken away by their parents after outpatient treatment, or are brought home by the police, do not count in any way.
Aside from when children just sit down after school and drink a bottle of liquor, there are three seasonal upsides that can be relied upon, according to Pelikán: witches, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"They either drink the sorrows of the wrong report card or celebrate the start of the holidays."
'Of course, I've had seven child drunks at the receiving end," the Pelican said.
Ironically, a drunk who spends the night detoxifying under the supervision of doctors is in advantage over the one who suffers an unpleasant hangover at home the next day.
In fact, morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are driven by irrigation infusions with glucose and nutrients that the body is missing.
"They're actually better off because they have a good awakening after that beautiful evening experience, and they're not in pain."
"They are only confused about where they are," admitted Pelikán, noting that he sometimes spoils the pleasant mood for patients by at least a list of the costs that their treatment required.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization on an acute bed will cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I applied it as an educational vehicle, when I then calculated directly to those children on their rounds how much their drunkenness cost and that they might also spend the whole summer on a part-time job to earn a year for the one party," the Pelikán added.
But health insurance companies, he said, do not proceed to the regression procedures in which the costs of treatment would recover from their parents in the cases of child drunks.
Two L-159s are in foreign hands in Spain for the first time
Two L-159s out of a total of five units, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M, flew to Sevilla, Spain, on Tuesday, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
It is the first time that machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
So far, they have only been on drills or demonstration flights abroad.
These are two-seat versions of the L-159T1, which were operated so far by the Czech army and which were airworthy.
The remaining three machines are a one-seat L-159.
These, meanwhile, are mothballed in Aero Vodochody and the broker of the deal - Omnipol - took over last week.
When the aircraft will physically dispatch from Vodochod is not known so far, according to Jan Pejšek from the Defense Press Department.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft for the shift have been removed from long-term stored aircraft, with no further deposits and investments from the Ministry's department."
"The two-seat L-159T1 was exchanged in its current state and form," Pejšek told Právo.
He added that the army would not be left without two-seat aircraft, as the Ministry signed a CZK 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four unnecessary L-159s into two two-seat machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the military in July, the other will take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, the EADS pledged to push the aircraft into the armament of some of the alliance countries.
"The contract clearly states that the buyer of the L-159 is EADS and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore a matter for the customer to how he will implement this matter," Pejšek said.
Hospodarske noviny reported some time ago that e.g. The Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The five L-159 for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for CZK 3.5 billion were approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
The Ministry of Defence did not issue a tender for the purchase and approached EADS directly.
The defense leadership at the time argued that the exchange would support future L-159 exports abroad.
The Czech Army bought 72 machines from Aero and only uses 24, the rest would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa aircraft is likely to have a court case.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in a European court because it was to select the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by reaching out to one manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last one should arrive at Prague's Kbely Airport in a fortnight.
Longer index finger than ring finger indicates lower cancer risk
Men who have a finger longer than a ring finger are at a lesser risk of getting prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British Cancer Journal.
It may be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men under 60, especially for men under 60," said co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help identify which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly in combination with a genetic risk or other endangered factors such as the family health burden, Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain watched more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients, and over three thousand healthy men at the same time.
More than half of the study participants had a finger on their right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They were as likely to have prostate cancer as for 19 percent of those whose fingers were the same length.
However, in the case of those with a fingerpace longer than a ring finger, the risk dropped by 33 per cent, with a decrease of 87 per cent for men to the 1960s.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers in question - shaped in the prenatal period - appears to reflect the different levels of the sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone is more than a longer index finger.
Earlier research has shown that it is testosterone that promotes growing prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told the Czech Press Agency that he was a cursory knowledge of the study, but he said he did not seem to have the relationship between the length of his fingers and cancer "completely proven."
Czech Republic under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered with snow on Thursday morning.
There is mostly driven snow on the roads and sidewalks, with road crews driving in many places all night.
The D5 motorway between the 89th and 93rd kilometres in the direction of Rozvadov is closed in the morning due to several accidents of trucks and cars and also stands the D1 u Brna in the direction of Prague.
News was told by the Central Automobile Centre dispatcher (ÚAMK).
A truck crashed there at mile 1, two trucks collided on the 93rd kilometer, the accident resulted in injuries.
Several passenger cars also ended up in the moat.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at the 185th kilometer in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers should go down just behind Brno at the 190th kilometer or go through Brno and then drive at the 182nd kilometre on the Rope.
There are several-kilometre columns.
There is also an accident on the D11 motorway, right at the arrival in Prague.
In Prague lies a several-centimeter layer of snow, the thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
Columns of cars are created on Prosek, for example, and Štěrboholská is also clogged.
The surest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run late, for example, on the line between Charles Square and Náměstí Míru.
At 8 a.m. the Prague Emergency Staff is scheduled to meet again.
There are also problems for railways and airports.
Czech Railways has already had to cancel seven express trains due to the snow.
For example, the line from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun has problems.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport was closed from 11 a.m. on Wednesday night until 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in southern Moravia are already passable, but only with increased caution.
Three secondary roads are impassable in Vyškov, snow is forming in places in Brno and snow chains are required to climb some roads in the above-set places.
The most affected places included Vyškovsko.
So far there are closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kucherov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
They will need to be put on with cutters.
When they will be cleared, it is not yet possible to estimate.
In Hodonín, caution is required in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which are only kept there for conservation by inert sprinklers, there is up to a five-centimetre layer of snow, ČTK reported.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimetres of snow fell, the most falling in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimetres.
The Moravian-Silesian Region received about 15 centimetres of snow.
Snowfall in the Czech Republic is gradually subsiding.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military has deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known only as the XM-25 for the time being codenamed XM-2.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban there and "change the game" to their advantage.
A new weapon is like a little super-acculatical cannon.
Her projectiles are guided by a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
The special 25 mm cartridges, developed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive explosive, effectively act as small grenades.
The embankment can be programmed by exploding not only when they hit the target, but at any point of their ballistic path.
They can therefore be used against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle, behind a wall or a trench.
He is not usually protected from above, and when the deadly rain of steel shrapnel is brought down on him, it can take him out of the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for infantry to use "smart" technology.
"The soldier basically treats it by finding the target, sends a laser beam to it to determine the distance, so he gets a specified intentional point, adjusts the moulder according to him and press the faucent."
"Say you've measured 543 meters."
"When you pull the trigger, the gun is charged and launched at a range of 543 meters, plus or orrime, one, two or three metres," Audette said.
It will relocate 400 jobs
Fujitsu will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs in July next year from the existing office building to the previous office building at the Marienbader-Nacek in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese concern Fujitsu will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry's specializing in computers and upkeep, the giant told on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move their jobs from the existing office building to the Marienbader-Nacek in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large administrative complex in Lyon Street, in a Frankfurt section called Niederrad.
According to the Fujista spokesperson, another 100 of the group's jobs, which are currently divided in the region, should be moved there in the foreseeable future.
The offer of the lease was said to be very attractive and the large-scale offices in the Astro Park are said to be more suited to the work type of employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only rented.
Subversive agent Bernd Wagner said, "in Frankfurt-Niederrad, we have found a central headquarters with excellent infrastructure."
An excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important venture within the region drew joy for winners and disappointments with the losers yesterday.
The head of economic officer in Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU), said that this had succeeded in acquiring a "global player."
It is said to be a "fantastic show of confidence in this locality."
Fujitsu is said to be suited to the city, settling is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was said to have been informed by the company management in time of his intention.
"Of course we offered the company our help," Korwis said.
But the friendly contacts could not change the computer manufacturer's difficulties with the landlord's landlord at the Marienbader-Nace.
As a result, economic reasons were decisive.
It is now about preventing a long non-admission in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The house on the Rathaus-Navid Square, which has been used by Fujitsu, and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" were among the most discussed building projects of the spa town, together with the other buildings on the Marienbader-Nace square.
It was created between the station and the town hall as a joint project of the city and a private designer of the so-called urban entree, which was criticized both for the massive construction of the areas that had previously served as a car park and also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consultancy and rating company, Feri, the manufacturer of travel distribution systems software, Start Amadeus, moved into the houses, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, who was then affiliated with Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were jointly acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, and after a year, the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA were sold in Madrid.
The Fujitsu-Concern of Tokyo is the third largest IT-provider in the world.
It offers computer and servers available to companies, for example, and also takes care of the services needed.
The branch in the Rhine and Main region is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu's most employees are in Munich.
A subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad, and other subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
The Astro Park administration building was leased 7,000 square metres for this purpose.
In the complex - his name draws attention to the star floor plan, which is twenty years old, is also based, among others, the central union of the electrical and electronics industry.
Amazon shuts down server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is getting in the clear.
Amazon's Internet service has turned off the detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this was done under political pressure following the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic dispatches.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, is reportedly stalling in the UK.
Wikileaks, the unveiling platform, is getting under increasing pressure in the United States.
Online activists have lost access to their previous home site in America and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is listed on the wanted list of Interpol, is to be delayed by a newspaper post in the UK.
"Wikileaks is no longer on the Amazon server."
"Free speech in the country of the free," the activists told the publication of the Facebook News service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before that, the online company Amazon downloaded Wikileaks' documents from its servers.
Internet activists used the release of the secret Amazon Web Service (AWS) diplomatic dispatches to handle the high number of access to the documents.
Using Twitter, Wikileaks explained to this move: "Fine - we will now spend our dollars by employing people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, "then they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's associates were said to have conducted a search, CNN reported based on information from Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Home Defense Committee threatened to boycott Amazon, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I would like Amazon to take this step earlier, given the earlier disclosure of classified information at Wikileaks," the senator said.
In the meantime, Lieberman has called for the platform to be prevented from using the servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, outrageously and recklessly, and thus our national security is put at risk and endangered life on the entire planet," a statement from the non-partisan senator said.
"No responsible firm - either American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in their efforts to expand the stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on the list wanted by Interpol.
Based on a report in the London paper "The Independent," the 39-year-old Australian is staying in the UK, with Scotland Yard said to know the exact location.
An online activist has always called the investigation in Sweden the intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there were also threats.
"There were even calls to assassinate Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is right to worry about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That's why the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson was apparently responding to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, asked the responsible person to be charged and executed for publishing at Wikileaks for betraying.
In Canada, a senior government adviser, Stephen Harper, said on television - probably ironically, Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could use a "facile aircraft."
Meanwhile, a verbal altercation between the White House and Assange began.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called this "ridiculous and absurd" for Assange's request to resignate Secretary Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for the diplomats' recently released espionage calls.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in the opinion of one person with the website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its website."
The US government is now extensively investigating the security of its databanks.
Deputy Director of the Center for Anti-Corruption Measures was appointed as a special commissioner, Russell Travers, the White House said.
Travers has become responsible for developing the "needed reforms in the structure" that are needed following the publication of the Embassy's reports to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review the ways the entire government is exchanging and protecting information.
The US government has also announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they should be at risk for the publication on Wikileaks.
"We have made all of this to come into contact with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
Ice cream university
At "Gelato University" near Bolephodes are being prepared for ice cream pastries for a better time of year.
There is great interest in the basic course for future ice cream makers, which lasts for three days, and visitors come from all over the world.
Where does the ice cream come from?
Gelatatiere and Gelataio.
Gelatatiere, a slightly outdated ice cream maker, makes the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the cooler with a coocoon, wipes it off in a waferle, and sells it.
To find out, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in Bologna Province.
But who wants to learn even more about ice cream, he will not avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, he set up an ice cream machine manufacturer with an ice cream university to make ice cream ice cream from its machines match America's high ideals.
There is huge interest in the basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts for three days, and visitors come from all over the world.
But there are also several-day special courses on chocolate ice cream and a practice in your own ice cream parlor.
Some yearn for a new career in their Midlife-Crisis, others vent the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the movement of Slow-Food and would like to offer a quality European product in the country of the industrial Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice-cream plant in Kair.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife in the home of Julia arrived because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal features of the perfect ice cream.
The crucial thing is not only good taste, but also silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget the Southern and patriotic icing on the cake during his training: "The Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then a good dose of romance is part of it."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano inserts the basic ingredients of milk, whipped cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a large blender that heats everything up to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then cools down to four stages immediately.
Then he turns the faucock on the machine and leaks the pasteurized white base cream, the base of all kinds of milk ice cream.
Immediately, the docent is peppered with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one experiment alone?
Luciano warns to be carried away by the spirit of the time into the unknown.
Who speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" apparently used the stabilisers anyway - mostly a natural product, such as guar flour from guar beans.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream without stabilisers, but it has to be sold in one day, otherwise it will collide and the customer is all ice beans.
Some variations of the basic mass are permissions.
It will be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream with ingredients that are bought at the supermarket in either the fruit department or the sweets department.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"The addressees will try to impose a lot of aromatized ingredients on you."
"But you should simply experiment."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with white base-grade ice cream, which turns the eggs into yellow cream and cocoa to the base for all sorts of chocolate temptations.
He is now allowed to attend the course for ice cream machines.
Luciano will always have them made by four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hazelnut ice creams - either with or without eggs in the base mass, with a more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will be conducted with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit puree - due to the taste it is not always better.
Leistcock's ice cream doesn't have to taste more hazelnut when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when the balanced mixture has highlighted the taste of Gelato correctly, says Luciano.
Making ice cream is a purely numerical task: If peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the share of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice cream requires an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano takes out the device to determine the sugar content of the fruit (the wine-growth is measured by the must of the grapes).
Fortunately, the tables ease the numbers.
Making ice cream no longer requires as much physical exertion as before.
It does not only help with the automatic production of basic mass.
There is also a device that simultaneously spans the finished ice cream mixture in the cream and cools to the minus temperature.
Despite all the automation, we can't avoid small accidents.
Brazilan Gustavo soil ups himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree, when a huge mixer gets out of control.
"In every course," believes Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Reviewers in the Double Light
The European Food Authority, Efsa, is linked to an industry experimenting with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of experts Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute to estimate the consequences of biotechnology.
"It's like a conspiracy theory, but we've documented it well," Testbiotech chief Christoph Then said in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the Efsa expert group for genthyn-changed plants, Harry Kuiper, and another expert, Efsa, have been under contract with the Isi lobbyists' union for several years.
It is funded by concerns such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper was a decisive contributor to the Ephso control regulations for genetic plants, and is thus in clear conflict of interest, criticizing the Then.
The Efsa regulations are said to be in complete agreement with the documents to the Isiso documents, bearing the manuscript of the industry, which should be audited by the office in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has highlighted the conflict of interest.
Recently, the senior executive from Efsa went without additions or transitional times to the Swiss agrarian concern Syngenta - and in doing so she changed sides.
Also, the Central Germany (MDR) radio recently revealed the EU-regulatory control office's personnel link with the industry lobby, raising the interest of both the Ministry of the Environment and EU parliamentarians.
In the meantime, Efsa cannot discern a conflict of interest.
It is working with all the earnest data, i.e. those from the industry, if they are of high-quality quality, it is mentioned in one statement.
Experts who work for the Ephares are not required to have contacts with the industry.
But they have to be substantiated.
Kuiper is a job admitting to the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US.
It is itself referred to as a neutral forum of experts in science, industry and politics - among other things, for estimating the risk of biotechnology without a contract by a lobbyist.
Independent experts such as the Then criticise the fact that the currently permitted gentechnically altered plants in animals are allowed without any experiment of feeding, and that the reaction of genetic plants to the environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what genthynically changed corn in the field, for example, says the Then.
Current practice is merely to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which will not be provided by reliable results.
"If they're not looking for risks, how would it be possible to find them then?", the Then asks the lawsuit.
Angelica Hilbeck agrees with that.
The science expert has been studying gentenika since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University in Zurich.
In this area, industry, as in the US, is now increasingly influencing or discrediting critical scientists in Europe.
That is why there are almost no scientists who are no longer connected to the concerns.
Most of the time, no studies are published, which are critical of the company.
"The industry is reviewing security research," Hilbeck believes.
Footage of the stones
Uli Gsell also bought some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he was standing in front of the station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the backhots arrived and began tearing down a large chunk of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against the S21, a billion-dollar reduction in the station.
When the construction was stopped, most of the wings were in ruins.
Broken to 6000, 7,000 pieces.
The limestone of Crailsheim, a soft rough stone that was used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43.
He secured several of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He mustn't disappear."
He dissolves: "Great and poor stone, simple and primordial."
When one cut it open, he smelled of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
A trail of Stuttgart stones leads to the forest at Tübingen to the former deponia of the French army's ammunition, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He bought all of them that were created during the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were grounded to the gravel or disappeared to the deponium," he says in his office, a wooden booth that was previously a guardhouse.
He tells of being sworn in and threatened when it said in September that he had bought the remnants of the northern wing from the company that was demolishing.
He spoke to opponents S-21 for days, though, talking to opponents of the S-21.
And he explained to them that he was not to blame for the demolition at all.
And when that's happening, it's the most sensible thing to do when the stones continue to be used.
Then took in about 200 S-21-opposites each took one about 80 kilogram block, the price for a piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a remembrance, some also in the hope of returning it in the re-construction.
Rongen bought 500 tons, a cargo of 25 large trucks.
About half of it is still in the woods, the rest sold long ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from all over and pulled back what could be come into the trunk and the trailer.
The stems of the Stuttgart dispute have long since become "widows" or as the edges of herb beds.
"This stone is not really special," says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political slip."
He gets into his SUV and goes for a ride on his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law first, interrupted his studies, later biology, then took an interest in computers, and eventually became a trader with stones.
And a rock lover.
It has stored 400,000 tons of stones.
He's tying his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old-tone merchant in the Republic.
Brake.
In the snow lies the artistically worked sandstone.
"Once belonged to Marien-blouse in Dresden," he tells me.
Sandstone from the Elbe, yellow, warm, is thrilled.
"My favorite stone."
We're going on the way up through the woods.
It points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the railway station in Karlsruhe.
And beyond.
"Here travertine."
Once, the blocks were in the stands of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lies the stones and stories, the Cannstatt-travertin from the police presidium in Stuttgart, the red granite from the temple of Sankt Blasien, tuf from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What jobs, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones were first broken up by hand and transported using simple hoistes and bullboys, it becomes entirely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if something like this was crushed."
He didn't become a rich, not a very rich one.
But the stone trader now employs 14 people, and besides, the stonemasons, one sculptor, one blacksmith, one glassmaker and one gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the one who valorizes the remnants.
They must go to Cologne for the foreseeable future.
There, too, the stones will be rescued.
Talent Fight for High-Potential
There's a lot of people at the snack.
16 students are crowded with sandwiches with salmon, tomato soups and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the carmaker Volkswagen invited engineering and design students to a workshop.
Together with the developers of VW, they are here to talk about the car of the future - and, by the way, to spot Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying to win the smartest heads at the plant, as well as VW, to succeed and bet on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible, to recruit the most gifted graduates in the auditoriums, before they reach the labour market and others are interested in them.
Since universities do not issue any lists of success of their students, companies are trying to discover exceptional talents in and get from practice-oriented projects.
At TU Braunschweig, the automotive concern is trying to win talent the next day.
A young lady from the personal department handles pens, gummy bears and VW logo boards.
It tells promising young talentes about programs on practice, student jobs and hints at them to travel to the group.
Nico Selle of TU Braunschweig takes care of the project with VW.
They see benefits for both sides: "Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"The VW can get to know the students at the same time, get to know interesting candidates, and think about who would be useful as a co-worker."
Such co-op, according to Selle, are not uncommon.
But the news is that there is so openly fighting for students.
"Otherwise, it was more of an essential professional project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates is likely to be even tougher.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from long hosts of applicants.
Instead, it must strive to try and seek to entice a particularly highly skilled workforce.
In particular, engineering graduates have an excellent negotiating position.
According to data from the Association of German Engineers of VDI, 40,000 civil engineering positions remained unfilled in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the so-called shortage of engineers will grow.
For the auditing and consulting firm KPMG, Roman Dykta is going on to hunt for talent.
Organizes challenging Recruiting-events, such as. KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure hunt in which participants must find their way according to the GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students around the US next year.
Participants can also view KPMG's branches and get acquainted with the company.
It will be decided in two selection rounds to see who will participate in the first rounds.
Only Crème de la Crème, of the many candidates, will fly to the US.
In the battle for High Potentials at universities, the increasingly harshy laws will apply, according to the Dykta.
"We want to be different from the others with our Race."
"A simple trip on a sailboat was too little for us."
It seems Dykta's talent scorer is in luck.
"We have remained in contact with all participants in a similar event last year."
"Some will soon be finishing their studies and planning to apply for a job," he says.
In addition to direct appealing on campus, small and medium-sized companies are presented in the classic markets of work.
"We try to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
"As e.g. on Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, head of personnel at the Solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The company from Bonn employs around 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the issue with young workers.
There are currently 35 positions listed on the company's website.
"At the moment, it's just the trouble of filling the vacancies."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is to contact professors at universities.
Solarworld works with various colleges, e.g. the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform us that it is possible to do a practice or write a thesis."
A solar specialist does not hold any expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company tries to attract other benefits: a personal atmosphere, a low hierarchy, and a light communication.
"Greatg shares often cannot offer this," says Stübe, head of the personal department.
In search of work, money has not played a major role for a long time.
Flexible working hours, caring for children or good practice options are other factors.
Solarworld took 55th in one study at the Great Place to Work Institute 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute is compiling a one-year list of Germany's top employers.
In addition, it asks co-workers how satisfied they are with their work and the working environment and monitors the framework conditions of the employees.
The head of the personal body, Stübe, hopes to bring her placements points with those interested in the job.
"I believe that those interested are briefing in particular on external evaluations of the potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, that means an internal measure in the first place.
"The best way to make yourself visible as an attractive employer is through its own employees," he says.
This is technically called the internal Employer Branding, i.e. the promotion of the employer in the market within its own employees.
"Satisfied staff are the best ambassadors."
When a company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they advertise on their own to their employers between friends and acquaintances.
"That's like a string game," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil wells
Over the coming years, new oil drilling will not be created in front of the coasts of the US-wide state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington has issued a corresponding ban - and thus, definitively, lifting earlier plans.
In front of the Atlantic coast, too, new wells are forbidden.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said so on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion at the "Deepwater Horizon" drill tower in April.
Prior to this disaster, which cost eleven employees to live and led to the largest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama signalled his willingness to pressure the opposition and industry, to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
As a result, proponents are trying to reduce the US's dependence on foreign oil supplies.
To date, it is not clearly explained who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the bay.
The centre of criticism is the British energetic concern BP, which is confronted with billion-dollar applications.
The Commission of Inquiry, commissioned by Obama, is expected to produce the results during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban that had been in place since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil concerns submitted applications for new drilling projects.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent such a disaster with stricter controls and strict security regulations.
At the moment, a fundamentally reforming the Audit Office, which drew attention to itself with many corrupt accusations.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would cancel lucrative tax evasion options for oil and gas concerns.
Industry is now openly warning that tighter regulation will fundamentally shrink the volume of oil drilled in the Gulf.
"Government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the gas and oil industries," reads the result of the current survey by the consultancy firm BDO - before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance, on top of that, complains of uncertainty in the field: "No one knows exactly what the regulation will change."
Investments in new mining projects are moving until further notice - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni region burned down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like a pump: billions of gallons of leaked oil have destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People steal, corruption and illegal oil cooking for a living.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry," an environmental activist reassures the journalists: "Today, you get enough of the oil mud in front of the lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian watched an attempt to photograph a boy who waded through the chests of his chest with the smudges surrounding the smudges: the scene was almost nice in the aquatic gloss with the rainbow colors.
The fact that brown rafts of oil floats under the surface is not visible.
Previously, she collected enough garnles in the containers here, tells Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slowly flowing water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a large amount of oil spilled into a huge warm area from the broken line.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must paddle for at least six hours to reach the waters where there are fish: the Ogoni area, located in the heart of the Niger River delta, is one of the worst-infest-abass areas in the world.
On the way down the river, the mangroves' swamp with a lot of side tributaries is noticeable about the entire drop range.
The boat engine boils brown porridge instead of light water, and whoever imfies his hand in the water pulls out the oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves towers rise from the ground like black sticks of licorice, the rarely occurring palm trees leave their leaves sadly hanging.
In vain we search for flocks of birds that normally occur in humid areas: As soon as the engine on the boat goes quiet, a haunted silence is taken up in an earlier paradise, where it smells like a pump.
"What is happening here is the ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari sadly: "We live in a constant fear of health."
Comparison with the war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield where it has been fought for several decades: more than 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe were flocked here, here the first resistance with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa formed in the 1980s, where the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993, because it was too dangerous for the staff.
To this day, the company is not allowed to return to the Ogoni area: while the entire delta is mined daily from the entire delta region of shorts with more than 5,000 mining drilling and 7,000 kilometres of running more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil fields in the Ogoni area lie fallow, the situation is too unstable for the Concern.
Every few hundred meters, the steel structure looming from the water of the steel structure as bizarre sculptures: "Christmas trees," so they are too tenderly called the head of the drilling holes.
They're 50 years old, most of them rusted to my marrift.
Every so often, the head of the drilling hole breaks, tells Akpobari, and then a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
Expert estimates suggest that more than two billion litres in the delta were leaked into the Delta ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil that flowed into the sea off the Alaskanskaya in the "Exxon Valdez" super-tanker crash 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in human history.
There is controversy over who is responsible for the continuing environmental misdependent.
While Shell calls sabotage and the organised oil theft more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental protectionists talk about the crackling heads of wells and leaking lines as the main cause.
Shell requires far less safety regulations in Nigeria than is customary in the world, the Concert accused US-American scientist Richard Steiner in 2008: Only the number of disruptions on the lines is said to be "several times higher than elsewhere."
In a place that looks from a distance like deserted, oil-sodified open-air workshop emerges from the mangroves of a figure: they are completely naked and up to your neck from oil.
Beneath one of the many barrels, which is partly connected by the guides, partly arbitrarily scattered on the ground, there is a fire: an illegal small refinery.
The oil heats up in a barrel over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group leader.
First, the gas leans out of the lead into the catching pot, later dripping at the end of the kerosine management and finally the naphtha.
In this way, Michael and his four co-workers produce up to four barrels a day for 300 litres: "We make about 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
Residents of the delta are taking advantage of chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil nation in the largest oil nation in Black Africa.
Nigeria owns only one refinery.
A ridiculously low price of 40 cents of the euro per litre of diesel can still be beaten by illegal producers: because they have the raw material for free.
It comes from "bouncers" who are joining the leadership everywhere in the Ogoni area: according to experts, at least 16 million litres of oil are lost to the country every day in the entire Niger delta region.
But only a negligibly small portion of the makeshift raw material is illegally ensorbed: the largest share will be filled by organized criminal networks, which include politicians and high-ranking military leaders, tankers, and sell it on the world market.
The debate on whether the people were a disaster and their interventions or a lax method of production is considered purely academic by the activist Akpobari.
"If the oil companies had not considered themselves invaders, and if they had not so thoroughly destroyed the nature of the fishermen, then there would be neither sabotage nor theft and illegal refinery."
In the meantime, however, the Ogoni relationship is so damaged in particular with Shell that only the departure of the conglomerate is possible: "Maybe other nations will show up as better as the Chinese."
Michael will be uneasy.
"Time to get lost," says the muscular manufacturer.
"The soldiers can come in any minute."
If they were found by a special military unit, they wouldn't be in danger of jail, but a painful bribe.
The soldiers, who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw material.
"The cursed thing has brought our country down to the bottom in all respects," says Akpobari.
Investigators have discovered a dangerous construction flaw in the A380 engines
The A380 clearly has a major safety malfunction.
Investigators found a possible construction error during a search of the machine, which had made an emergency landing, which could have led to a "catastrophic engine failure."
The airline Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus seemed to have had more luck at the emergency landing in early November than was previously known: the Australian Air Safety Board found a major safety defect in its investigations on the engines of some of the A380s - and is now warning of a possible building error.
Perhaps the glitch would have serious consequences: one oil connection could create cracks due to wear out, a statement released by the ATSB was heard in a published statement by the ATSB this Thursday.
This could lead to a "disaster engine failure."
These are engines made by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380s aircraft.
Among them is the airbus of the Qantas, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against a British turbine manufacturer.
It filed a statement of reasons for the action before the Australian Federal Court of Sydney, which is allowed by further legal measures against that company.
The head of Qantas, Alan Joyce, said his company would seek compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
Parts were released during the engine fire and they damaged the load-bearing surfaces.
Rolls-Royce identified the burning oil as the cause of the damage.
After this event, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will conduct further safety tests with the giant aircraft that are equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royces, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety deficiency was considered important enough to inform all those concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines has kept three of its eleven A380s on the ground on a temporary basis.
Lufthansa replaced the engine with one A380 as a precautionary measure.
The two-storey aircraft is the largest passenger plane in the world.
National snowfall will create chaos in traffic
Germany in all over white: it snowed overnight in almost the entire country.
Chaos reigns on many roads, train connections and planes are being shut down.
At least three people have died in traffic accidents.
The winter frosts of Germany: almost the whole republic fell into the snow at the frigid temperatures at night - leading to the chaos of the traffic in many places.
To the north and east, up to 15 centimetres of snow lies in some places.
On several motorways and many roads there is heavily limited traffic.
At the A7 at Flensburg, the road service was still in deployment, but it could not handle the newly blown snow.
There was also a strong gusty wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects a storm on the Baltic Sea coast in Schleswig-Holstein in the morning with a water level of 1.2 metres above normal.
Snowdrive snow drifts have caused significant problems in Saxony on motorways and state roads.
According to the Meteomedia's head of bad weather, the level of alarm was therefore on the purple - the highest level ever - in Saxon Switzerland.
In part, 30 centimetres of new snow fell, heavy and fresh winds caused by drifts.
There were several trucks and cars left at night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported major difficulties on the roads.
The A2 was caused by wind and snow of slow operation and constipation.
There was trouble in Thuringia because of the snow on the A4 and A9.
According to the German Railways, major problems occur in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the tracks or broken upper lines and switches.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be halted.
In Jerusalem's Saalfeld, he had to stop an ICE to Munich.
165 passengers were given wool dungeons, food and drink by firefighters and rescue workers on the train.
Snowy winds blew over the roads.
At major German airports, many flights were cancelled due to snow winds.
According to a spokesperson for the headquarters for information about the flights, the announced flights have already been reported from Munich.
In Frankfurt nach Main, 40 flights have been cancelled, according to Fraport spokesperson.
Road maintenance is in constant deployment.
While few passengers were left unlicensed at the airport, 400 field beds are prepared for them.
On many roads, accidents occurred as early as Wednesday evening.
In the evening, one lorry driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in eastern Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
The snow-covered road caused a similar accident close to Nuremberg: a lorry was also caught on a railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the early hours.
And to that, a 30-year-old woman died after she rolled her car over onto a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
But the meteorologists have good news: the snow will remain in the form of light powder, and will therefore be raised with light gusts of wind.
But the wind will weaken.
Only on the Baltic Sea will there be fast winds with a gale force.
But it will be very cold - locally to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank looking for buyers for twins towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to one newspaper post, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could raise up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank had just renovated its headquarters: Twins' towers in Frankfurt's banking district were upgraded; in the meantime, the bankers were allowed to rejoine their old jobs.
But now the financial concern seems to want the renovation costs back - and is looking for a buyer for both skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" reports, citing the spokesman.
The spokesman did not name the reasons for the planned sale.
"We are still investigating whether it is more meaningful to own or sell the property and then lease again," he said.
This is again to give up its corporate headquarters in Germany, after a short time.
The bank only took over the Twin Towers in mid-September 2007 for 272 million euros from investors of their own fund and subsequently renovated them expensively.
The energy reconstruction has swallowed around 200 million euros, according to the data.
Selling would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
Experts in the field estimate the value of the renamed to "Greentowers" of the so far-renched towers at around 500 million euros, according to the newspaper text.
The spokesman said it was not decided whether the building would be sold back to the fund's property or to an independent investor.
Thousands of mourning the dead miners
More than 10,000 people honoured the sourdough miners of New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions in the mine.
It has still not been possible to rescue the dead, as the security situation remains complicated in the shaft.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a powerful explosion in Pike River Mine, near the town of Greymouth.
The 29 miners aged between 17 and 62, were overwhelmed in the mine.
The probe was launched into the shaft where the disaster occurred, but found no trace of life.
Due to high concentrations of poisonous gases and subsequent explosions, the rescue forces were unable to descend for safety.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that the miners no longer had any chance of survival.
It still failed to be freed for the dead.
Now the memory of the dead has been honoured by relatives and friends.
In the Greymouth on New Zealand's southern island, ten thousand people gathered in sunny weather.
They were two minutes quiet.
To commemorate the buried miners, 29 tables were built, with helmets, lamps and miners' names.
Pictures and personal items, such as clothing and surfboards, found their place here.
On state government buildings, flags flew at half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would once again come to the surface from the "deep of the country," New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants in the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He cannot say goodbye to his son until he saw his dead body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was swamped in the mine.
In addition to the prime minister's chair and relatives of the victims, the commemorative ceremony was attended by several foreign diplomats.
During the explosion on 19 November, British and South African miners were also overwhelmed.
Rescuers started by putting out a fire inside a coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As the poisonous gases dissolve, the high temperatures inside the mine begin to cool, police president Gary Knowles told journalists.
Hell, warriors!
Is a horror movie going to a arts.
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is attempting to re-run the old boundaries with his combat epic "Walhalla Rising."
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured one-eyed Viking fighter (Mads Mikkelsen) breaks free from his tormentors and kills in a big way with almost the supernatural strength of his opponent - it sounds ideal for young men's viewers who are looking for bloody action because our hero helps himself with cruel killing methods and even tearing his enemies from his abdomen alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, One-Eyed, as he is actually called, does not say a word in the whole film, and the other characters utter at most one or two sentences or be drawn to the harrowing dying screams.
Otherwise, it is silent and puffed in the gruesome beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers the backdrop to the world of the Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is more ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts with an interest in existencialism and very quiet camera footage.
It's a good thing for a movie to have multiple target groups, it's just a shame when they're mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn, after making his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers, "Pusher" is considered the Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically resists to bring his works closer to the mainstream's humour or less brutal to an artistic audience.
Most fans of the art cinema seem to be discouraged everywhere by their brains and guts.
Supporters of action films will not be bored at the latest when the One-Eye goes for loosely explainable reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries of ships to Jerusalem and remain hung in a noimation of air and fog for an eternity before the team appears to reach America and remain silent there.
It is no wonder, then, that in Germany "Walhalla Rising" did not make it to cinemas and was now released only on DVD.
It's a pity mainly for the wonderful shots, but also because behind the distinctive facade, sometimes courtee, the blood is hidden, hiding an exciting cinema that deserved a bit of attention.
This film is not about dialogue or the exact plot, everything is an atmosphere, a feverish dream that became a film.
And that's not for the viewer to escape.
Refn will not give him a moment of relaxation and slowly choke him with his chilling shots and a gloomy hypnotic soundtrack, but above all, indescribable hatred that is said to come from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blonde boy who helps the One-Eye keeps something like innocence, everyone else is driven by malice.
Of all, the most one-eyed hero, whose motifs will never be explained, who will become a warrior from hell for his enemies and temporary allies, perhaps the emissary.
It portrays destruction, perhaps but also only for the corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for the angry, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA has new alerts to the secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country resists expression - and does not allow for controls.
Around midnight on September 5, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 warplanes will attack the mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrat; the nearest major city is 30 kilometres away and is called Dair as-Saur.
In the documents of the International Office for Nuclear Energy (IAEA), her name appears when it is a reactor allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that turns away from the current.
Following a memo from the US-American foreign secret service to the CIA in late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited to the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
The 1950s technique is not suitable for anything else.
The CIA presented a video of unfocused satellite images.
Using computer animation, she explained where the reactor components might have been before the destruction were to be a scaled-down copy of the Yongbyon nuclear center's North Korean model.
In addition, there were also submitted photographs that showed the building up close or even from the inside.
The reactor was said to be shortly before launch, but still without fuel cells.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, there is little more to know than it was then, even the puzzles have grown even bigger over time.
Earlier US President George W. Bush recently disclosed in his memoir that the CIA was very sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in the el-Kibar, but it did not have the evidence that there was a "active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence retractories in Europe are even more cautious and talk only of a "alleged reactor," even if they view the CIA's presentation as "current."
They lack clear evidence, as do IAEA.
When asked how he was sure to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat replied in the summer, the IAEA said to have "a sufficient material to ask questions."
The hut of the supposedly "unused military building" was quickly cleared away by the Syrians and also properly aligned the terrain.
Nevertheless, the IAEA team was found in June 2008 under the leadership of former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in the el-Kibar of the Uranium Track, which was made by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite photographs of commercial vendors through a member state from just after the attack, which should be more aptly than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these footage are not on the market, because they were exclusively bought by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
The IAEA cannot therefore confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it has never had a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
Uranus is derived from Israeli weapons, Damascus has commented.
But this was refuted by the IAEA after the particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as well as the satellite footage.
In addition, he banned the auditors from a second inspection in the el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed-out building.
But Israel is also doggedly silent.
"We will never comment on this," the ruling Prime Minister Ehud Olmert recently confirmed the official position at that time.
The investigation into this case has thus dragged on to no avail since June 2008, and "grows into a serious problem given the credibility of the office," as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA's headquarters in Vienna has admitted - a serious breach of the nuclear ban treaty oversees by the IAEA.
The IAEA sees the next three devices to be "in a functional connection" to the alleged reactor - and, unlike it, still exist.
The auditors have not yet stated, nor which equipment, or what function they are, or why they are suspected.
According to information from the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally refers to them as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived again by nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found a building complex that is believed to be one of the suspicious objects in satellite imagery.
It appears to be inside or in the immediate vicinity of a military base - for this reason, Syria rejects the IAEA's access to these three sites.
In Vienna, it was said that the Syrians were afraid of a so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent to the US to find military bases.
Nuclear detectives have been alerted to the facility by the US Secret Service.
The IAEA has the paperwork, as well as satellite images, that material was transported back and forth between these three seats and the square at Euphrat.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said that at least one furnished should be "in the context of fuel production."
But there are no "no evidence of sensitical activity," i.e. enrichment of uranium and re-processing; the processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium came from and where it should later be planted with a bomb plutonium, for these central questions there are only likely estimates.
It is also unknown whether the wreckage that could hide important clues are kept in these three places.
It was as if the hundreds of cargo trucks had disappeared from the face of the earth, no one seemed to have information about where the debris had come.
Only a few miles from the el-Caphone remote and on the other side of the Euphrata, the al-Tibni salt mine, which was inspected by Syria in 1998 as a suitable warehouse for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Earlier IAEA inspector Robert Kelley leaked it in a reactoral analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review.
But images from space show that after the IAEA requested access, Syria carried out earthworks at all the suspicious sites and removed large containers.
It might have been a coincidence, but it didn't help to clear up the suspicions.
In addition, diplomatic circles speak of the fact that the IAEA has spent many months creating a plan for auditors to allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows how much of the interest of the auditors is.
Meanwhile, Damascus has rejected this proposal.
A year ago, if, just a year ago, Western diplomats were reassuring that the reactor was being destroyed, and that's why the matter was not burning, for months, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking about so-called special inspections, one of the harshest funds the Vienna Nuclear Authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose inspections, has already spoken of the "option to which I am leaning in the future," but has so far hesitated.
This choice places a great risk: On the one hand, a majority in the IAEA Governing Board is needed, and many of the 35 countries represented are certainly not interested in escalating.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out: "What happens if they don't find anything in the end?"
Love in the Time of War
Since Angelina Jolie began working on a nameless directorial initial in the summer, there have been difficulties.
She wrote the script herself, a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not yet known - but this, too, causes restlessness.
There is persist in the talk of the woman, who is a Muslim, fall in love with the Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's associations protested at once, so the planned filming from Sarajevo to Hungary in a hastily moved.
The film, meanwhile, has been taped in Hungary and is in post-production, but there is still a protest in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women's War victims wrote Jolie via UN-organization to help refugees UNHCR and demanded a meeting with the actress, the Bosnian newspaper reported now - Jolie is also the UN-organization ambassador to help refugees.
It is not exactly diplomatic - she offered to meet the women in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused to do so.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in the campsite where the rape was raped, and Jolie's attitude toward the victims reveals a lot about the script.
Her organization has therefore recommended the UN-Organization to Aid for Refugees to release Jolie as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
What scenes did Jolie write exactly?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received its script to be read, allowed filming after minor tussles in Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author stresses that in her film she does not follow any political intentions, that she has made great efforts to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give all the parties involved the space.
Due to the content, it remains vague.
There is another version of the film circulating on the internet that sounds really quite different: the lovers knew each other before the war and meet again when she, like a Bosnian Muslim woman, is taken to a Serbian campsite, where he serves as a guard.
Which does sound a lot different than "a victim of rape falls in love with his tormentor."
The fact that Jolie's film really starts before the war - is true.
Jolie argues that there is pressure on her, which is "not fair and based on faulty information."
Now they can be freed by Hollywood hecklers: By posting her script illegally on the Internet, as they've done many times before.
Nothing but gone
This evening is good for the Irish again.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates power significantly over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans roar with joy to the sound of loud music, stamping their feet.
Bailey-Pub is booing in Cork, South Ireland, because players throw tennis balls at a distance of three metres into beer cups - and hit.
The "Beer Pong" is called the bizarre theater and can be won 500 euros as a winning bonus, plus a ticket to Las Vegas at the World Championships in beer pong in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; this shouted beer game and a restrained computer scientist, that doesn't sit well with each other.
Yet the 26-year-old man is trying to entertain, to unwind from the burdensome question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not a playing passion in Las Vegas, he's going to an interview in New Zealand in January.
"I have a strange feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far away, and I don't have a job there yet."
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she immediately got her dream job as an Eventmanager, maybe a good sign," says the young man, smiling.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of the Tanner siblings have attempted their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT-adviser in London.
The boys leave: As with the Tanners, it looks like in many families on the island.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the foreseeable future, predicts experts at the ESRI scientific institute for the Economics and Social Affairs in Dublin.
They even count on 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the forecasts are confirmed, there will be a similar expatriation wave to that endured by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of the rise that has brought great affluence to the Irish, the dismalness is now once again expanding.
The economic crisis is particularly unsettling for young, educated Irish people, who have only experienced a rise so far.
Job loss and social descent seemed absurd to boom in these years.
Everyone needed, money was in short supply.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men under 30 are out of work.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters from readers complaining: 'Everything goes downhill in Ireland.'
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but whoever can, he goes away, and it loses our country for a generation."
"Please let the last one go out."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future in black because the government is said to be deceiving and offers no future prospects for young people.
"They are educating the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She watches her classmates dive from one unpaid practice to the next.
Her biggest concern is that she will have to move out on her own in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo," an exhibition that offers a full service on the subject of work abroad.
"For job-boomers, jobseekers abroad are an excellent chance to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
His website features photographs of surfers in Australia and snowboard skiers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not galleys, but freedom and joy.
Sean O'Donovan has known about what it's like to build something somewhere else for six months.
As the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed by 15 Irish colleagues at a construction site in Germany.
He's building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen right now.
In January, it continues to Hannover or Berlin for another project.
O'Donovan, meanwhile, seldom gets home because he works in extra shifts to pay off a home loan at home.
"The situation is sometimes a bit crazy," he says, as he crosses the threshold of his own house for the first time in a long time.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I'm basically not at all in."
He laughs awkwardly and walks through the cold rooms.
The small house is in a good neighborhood with well-maintained gardens, with large expensive cars parked in the entrance.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for €38,000 - 100 percent funded by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, the simple money was without many questions," he says.
Is he worried that the loan might not go well?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, hot tea is coming down, and he says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; even if things get ugly, I can start all over again."
The Construction Engineer doesn't like the moaning he hears so often.
"No one has to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it was on this island," he says.
"Suiting abroad for a while, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we'll just feel like the Irish afterwards."
He laughs and then tells of his father, who left for England in the last economic crisis.
"Seven years later, he was back again, and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Keep the future open and simply wait for life to develop elsewhere.
He has also had several years of work in London, and why shouldn't it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand as well?
But there is one more thing that is of concern to him these days: his 27th birthday party in Dublin on Friday.
She's afraid she might get hurt to the farewell party.
"Mainly no emotion," he says, having a good drink of beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a celebration of the departure, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Common practice of democracy
The promotion of democracy in Latin America is growing, as is the promotion of private enterprise.
The criminal activity is more apprehensive than unemployment.
And Brazil is considered more influential by the United States to be of the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarómetro survey, which took place in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist.
As the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it can thus monitor changes in attitudes across the whole area.
This year's survey, which took place in September and the beginning of October, is dominated by two related items.
The first is that Latin America is in a rather cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Democracy support in several countries on the outskirts of the Pacific in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth averages 6% a year since 2002, democracy support has grown from a low of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also rose in Mexico, where economics recovered after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of those polled in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous areas, are convinced Democrats, which is pulling the regional average (see chart 2).
About 44% of respondents across the whole area expressed satisfaction with the way in their country of democracy works in practice, this is the same figure as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, it is a large increase (Figure 3).
Roughly 34% said they trusted the Diet in their country and 45% trusted the government, again these were the same numbers as last year, but it is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic crisis undermined democracy in Latin America.
Support was created during the global financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the Latin American population living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009, dropping back to 32% again this year.)
But the mood is changing in a wide range from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil's strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in the broad-added sense of progress.
This situation is scarceier in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and the state of violent crime worsened.
It is only the second time since the surveys began to be conducted that more respondents across Latin America see crime as the most important problem rather than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Roughly 31% say that either they or their close relatives became victims of crime last year, but that is a decrease compared to the figure of 38% from last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
More massive economic performance is reflected in growing support for private enterprise and the market economy: about 71% of respondents across the sector say that private enterprise is essential for development, a percentage of 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% agree that a market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, a percentage that has grown from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same view (and 80% there support private business), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, expropriates many private firms.
Brazil is a country that has a leading position in the region, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and in much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticized elections
No one expected the general election in Haiti on 28 November to be perfect.
But they were far worse than the outsiders, who are trying to help the affected country to be afraid.
The election was a filling urns and a repetitive vote, ballots scattered across the sewers, a broken polling station and intimidation.
The polling stations open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many of the move because of the January earthquake, wandered around, trying to find out where they could go to vote.
Some of them finally gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including several presumed preliminary prescribers, shouted that it was a hoax and called for the election to be held.
Protests, some of them of violent character, spread across the country.
Still, Edmond Mulet, a high-ranking UN official in Haiti, said that "it was in many ways a pretty good election."
Observers from the Organization of U.S. States States and the Caribbean Community cautiously said they "did not believe that these inconsistencies, however serious, did not necessarily have to cancel the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are beholdled by René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate Jude Célestin, is scheduled to give preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected deciding contest is scheduled for January.
All electoral hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, the former first lady, have withdrawn from their original call to declare the vote invalid.
But the problem may arise if Mr. Célestin, who has little or negligible support among voters, is called by the Electoral Commission for achieving a decisive contest.
The rampaging cholera epidemic and the more than 1 million people still living in the tents after the earthquake were concerned that the turnout would be low.
In the end, many of the Haitians wanted to vote, but because of the disorganization, they were prevented from doing so.
The roughly 250,000 identity cards required for the vote remained undistributed shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
The donors see the choice of a legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it is clear, then, that the Haitians will do so for themselves.
Topic to the center
In the weeks when she was suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, is benefiting from public sympathy, when her popularity boosted from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet reversing this success in a successful campaign for a second term in next year's election may depend on whether the grieving Mrs. Fernández gives up the uncompromising of her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And on these signs, everything will be based.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to pursue economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, was in the habit of compiling budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional revenue at will.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split up and was further destabilized in Mr. Kirchner's death for a heart attack on 27. October.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (on which were slapped and blamed on the government for corruption), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will now also be in place for next year, with the president having more space to spend at will.
The economy is overheating: growth of up to 9% is likely this year.
The official inflation rate is now at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists are talking about a figure approaching 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was plagued by an economic collapse, made it a priority for growth and reducing poverty, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, burdened the private sector and cleaned up the INDEC, a statistical agency that agreed to monitor the official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now moderate this policy?
It called for negotiations between private businesses and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by rising world prices for the export of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation was disrupted by growth based on a major devaluation in 2002.
This may be why President Fernández is to know that she wants to renew Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government created a deal with the bondholders, who had previously refused to restructure the debt that Argentina failed to pay in 2001.
Now, President Fernández faces an agreement with the creditor governments that are grouped together at the Paris Club, to which it owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted that this fact not in the IMF's oversight, as is usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Economy Minister, announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to propose a new national consumer-price index to commemorate the introduction to the INDEC purification.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of her term of office when the husband is no longer by her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to gain the support of the middle class, which is tired of kirchnerism.
At the time of the Argentines' return from their summer vacation, which they have in March, the wave of sympathy will be in decline.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether it will be necessary to quietly renounce the many views her husband has held in politics.
Half-avings for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to a closer link to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those eligible, voted on 27 November for the mayors and the city council in five city districts, which may be considered a broader assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that prevail for the mainland and have a strong set in business relations, including the partly free trade agreement, in the greatest adjustment of relations with China since 1949.
President Ma passed the test, but only just.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended in winning three of the mayor's five offices, it failed to win by a majority vote.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is in favor of Taiwan's greater independence, won almost 50% of the total vote against 45% of the KMT party.
If this were a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote has fallen by around 8%.
The DPP party was first together with KMT on city councils.
The election took place like most of the Taiwanese elections, which involve noisy election trucks and mass rallies with flags with scinely cape-strong girls.
It was even a mandatory mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was agitating for the KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien purely over his face, wounding him and killing the viewer.
It was not bizarrely determined whether the militant intended to injure Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the DPP's leader, claims that the shooting affected the election, the suspicions fall on the DPP and leading voters towards KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of land itself remained behind.
Instead, the candidates were wrestling with plans for state housing and job creation.
Taiwan is usually enjoying its de facto independence and hates the military threats of China.
So KMT tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also abandoned the uproar of anti-China's attitudes.
It is a response to the fact and realisation that Chinese trade is crucial to Taiwan's economic survival.
President Ma for his party confirmed that China's policy is acceptable to most of Taiwan.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue to pursue commercial bribes, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back to the flock.
China wasted no time in sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange an investment protection and medical cooperation summit.
They would also like to see political integration, too, but in the first place.
This would be better to wait for after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP has discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was at the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
The president in 2000-08 was a rebel and a supporter of clear independence.
But under the leadership of Ms Tsai, a new generation has developed, and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Ms Tsai was proclaimed as a DPP candidate for president, such as Su Tseng-chang, who held the office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing everything they can to show that they can also work with Beijing.
Ms Tsai has published plans for research institutes serving as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their actions can take place without prior conditions.
Ms Tsai is telling the Taiwanese public that her party is a "credible alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be angered by this shift.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed the opinion that the DPP's candidates would have done better if they insisted Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, the pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will fight to choose between potential candidates.
KMT is justified to locate its own people.
Mr Ma's assessments were poor, despite the rapid pace of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to go to the campaign with him.
His unpopularity seems to be based mainly on unemployment and a widening gap between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesman says he will reorganise his cabinet, as well as the local branches.
The strong proposals in support of Taiwan to establish friendly liaison are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "a point from which there is no return has passed."
Grammy nomination: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of best new artist
The appearances at the request of the president and people are bound to be noticed.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is described as one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a nomination for the best new artist.
Since Spalding was a glorified figure on the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" was released in 2008, the nomination came a little late, but it's in line with the Grammy rules, with the artist not allowed to release more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is established."
Her ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" has certainly taken a step forward, and thanks to her carefree vocal style and a nimble hand with elements of pop, funka and Latin influences, we can speak of Spalding as the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the earliest equivalent for voting at the Grammy, who are looking for a similar jazzwork in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere Grammy judges rightly award the album Vijay Iyer Trio "Historicity" in the instrumental album category, an exciting, refreshing ride of the album, which was the hot favourite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album by veteran saxophonist James Moody's "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley's "Positotola."
Trombone Shorty, the hoarse favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest on HBO's "Treme" was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise in favor of Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber's albums.
The wild band Darcy James Argue's Secret Society, with knowledge of steampunk, has received several well-deserved acclaim in the category of major ensembles, with the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble in competition and the still-beast Dave Holland, whose live album with the Octet of "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how a bassist can have a free hand as a bandleader.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leads the classical music category
The nominations for classical music have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards.
The nominee's leading position is held by Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for the piano and orchestra, with a score of five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse," an eclectic orchestral work, with a score of three points.
Among the nominees with a link to Southern California, the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles," a work commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer located in L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a shot at the award.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
The category for the classical music producer of the year has five nominees, which are Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classic album were won by Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" project from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" listing various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As far as the opera category is concerned, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are nominated for the Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 for a performance that was recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute episode is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for an instrumental performance by a soloist with the orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said he had written a 15-minute work specifically for the mandolin performer Avi Avitala, who performed at a concert with Metropolis Ensemble based in New York.
"I wrote it with tones from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category, for the management of the Chicago Symphony in recording the work of Stravinsky.
The instrumental soloists who received the nomination are the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the organist Paul Jacobs; the violinist Julia Fischer; and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were among the nominees for the vocal soloists this year, with Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of transition of the classic, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
Scheduled mosque in Temecule receives approval of the Planning Commission
The planned mosque in Temecule received the unanimous support of the local planning committee after more than five hours of often heated public testimony.
Critics have attacked the project for promoting terrorism and leading to a suspension of trade.
However, the judges decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center was in accordance with local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to support this project - Christians, Jews, who you remember," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of it as an American citizen."
"It implies that justice always prevails."
"The opposition is minimal" he added.
"Those who are against are merely shouting loudly."
"We have really great people in our valley."
Negotiations began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted until almost midnight, when discussions with people who were in favour or against the center took most of the time. These voices were evenly divided, the Press-Enterprise says.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," one comment showed.
"We are the Planet of the Apes with the Statue of Liberty in the sand."
"America has dropped."
The planned Islamic Centres also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including proximity to Ground Zero, the site of the tragedy that took place on September 11, 2001, when New York was attacked by terrorists.
In Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned the violence.
His religious community of around 135 families was plagued in Riverside County for years without incident, but he wanted a larger and more suitable space than the storage space he rented out with a filter system manufacturer.
The new 2,494-square-foot mosque in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minarets and will grow to a height of 43 feet.
It should take up space of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, approximately three kilometres east of the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council on the project.
Microbes with resistance to arsenic increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients extends the space for the search for new forms of life on Earth, and perhaps beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth, claiming that this is a sign that life has options that stand outside the main elements that have been considered and basic to date.
"This organism has a dual ability."
"It can grow either because of phosphorus or arsenic."
"This fact is very strange, but it is not proof that this is a form of truly 'Automilic' life," Paul C. commented on this fact. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appeared in the online edition of Science magazine on Thursday.
It has long been considered necessary to live for six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, scientists have found that the bacteria, discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after the arsenic is replaced by phosphorus.
"You'll be amazed at what's still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This find is significant for the search for life outside of Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life might look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, the news release to discuss it, which did not reveal details of the find, sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that power biochemistry and that a set of elements that we consider 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not a part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element with another in the basic biochemical and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, which led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it exhibited high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she thought that the microbe, which is exposed to both elements, could be able to be substituted for one after another.
"Arzen is poisonous mainly because his chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can very hardly separate these elements from each other."
"However, the arsenic is so different that it doesn't work, like phosphorus. When he gets into the organism, he starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to an increasing concentration of arsenic that the bacteria are able to adapt and to grow.
Microbes grow better when phosphorus is active, but as they can also survive with the arsenic replacement, the possibility of the life-form that uses arsenic occurs naturally increases, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or a month where the arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor at microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea of an arsenic that could be replaced by phosphorus was not new, but there was never an example on which to prove the fact.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that it could have been used by earlier life forms.
"This suggests that there may have been other ways to create life, not just the way it was created in the early Earth," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton
The other two of the four show dogs that had been stolen from the Bellflower Motel had been found. The sheriff of the Los Angeles area reported on Thursday.
Four showwalk dogs - two Akits and a Welsh Pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when the Chevrolet Express van was stolen in which they were spending the night at the Bellflower 6 Motel, was told by the authorities.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two dogs were discovered late on Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Police Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape."
"They were passed to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what location, nor did he share detailed information about their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We're following the rules."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not intercepted to comment on the case.
They were very pleased when their two Akits were found at the Downey Reservoir on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's deputies found the van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akity Trace, Trace's three-year-old dog and 10-month-old Didi bitch, were uninjured, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who had planned to participate in this week's regional competitions on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained unhumbled until they were discovered late on Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship at Long Beach, where they planned to show off Trace.
The other dogs were to compete in other competitions scheduled for the AKC/Eukanuba show in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is only one stop for the couple's nearly a month of travelling around dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard registered for the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs - a puck boxer, Parson Russell Terrier and a Breton Hound - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akity and Pembroke Welsh corgis were left in the car, where it should have been cooler.
They opened the windows a little to get the dogs in the car enough fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the car theft at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he would offer a reward to anyone who would lead them to the missing dogs. Dogs are implanted with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, it was unclear whether the awards would be awarded.
The lion is ready to roar again now that the restructuring of MGM is receiving final approval from the court
After 18 months of tremors and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start again.
On Thursday, the federal insolvency judge in New York officially blessed the creditors' plan to settle about $5 billion in debt and clear the trip for the 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on the production and production of movies and television shows.
Thursday's decree that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy order does not leave MGM with any legal obstacles to the relaunch of Spyglass enttainment founder Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main leaders of the downed studio.
The number of employees will fall to around 320 from the original more than 400.
MGM will not emerge suddenly from Chapter1 until JPMorgan Chase agrees on the planned financial resources to allow a $500 million loan to be funded by new operations and MGM productions.
It is now a merger with an investment bank that needs $75 million on its own and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to deal with its finances, as management struggled to afford interest payments of $300 million a year.
That August, Chairman Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, the former CEO of Enron and the Rift Expert, a well-known work for Krispy Koughnuts.
Attempts by Moelis and Cooper to resolve the financial difficulties of MGM and 140 studio creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed to put the company up for sale at the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several bidders, none of them were willing to pay US$2 billion, plus the funding demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, it was all back on the drawing board and the MGM team began work on the restructuring plan. After months of debate and internal disagreements, the plan was eventually approved by the creditor at the end of October.
When MGM officially rises from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive multimillion dollar bonuses in dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which collect $375,000 a month for their services that govern the company's run, $375,000 a month, will receive a reward for success, the so-called "success fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which has only released one film this year and put together a proposal for seven or eight films that will be released in early 2012.
They also plan to participate in the financing of two films, the model of which will be the book "Hobit," together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a special loan of between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share of these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debts, was looking for the possibility of merging the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent negotiations between the two companies did not result in the agreement.
Technological toys that will keep your gift budget in balance
This year's leading candidate is the most amazing iPad toy, followed by a video game system. In both cases, however, this is a significant hit to the gift budget.
Consider that for the price of one iPad you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 and one game of Kinect costs as well as 10 bead switches or about 48 Play-Doh cups.
But there is a way to balance your gift budget.
I recently visited three national toy retailers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that the Moore law was in place; this year's technology toys had far more energy, at the same prices, if not lower, compared to past years.
While there have been relatively fewer new new tolls with associated sites, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as are toy guns with charging batteries.
Here are some references.
(All of these prices are from Toys "R" Us, except in cases that are indicated differently.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13$, 3 years old) are stuffed animals that sing when you squeeze their tummy.
At one press, the animal makes a note and the other squeeze begins to form a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and in a harmonious way.
Warning: Once you start squeezing, you can't stop.
The best choice in a combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, 2 years)
Last year, I rented a 14-inch animatrox doll on Elmo Live technology, which can play Simon Says and can also walk monthly thanks to its innovative folding leg with wheel blocking.
Children test the Mickey Dance Instructor's toy, though their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the '80s, you might remember the Alphia, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playland, $40, for children from the age of 3), with a backpack full of quiz cards that are designed to be car-going to be fun with a self-corcorrected, funny workbook.
If you're eyeing a smartphone for your child, there are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for children from 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest option with simple use, with qwerty keyboard, although the games do not have as effective lessons as the Leapster Explorer ($70 for children from 3 to 12 years old), the first major change to Leapfrog's Leapster series, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children aged 3 to 7) uses the iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($$, Hasbro, for children aged 8) is a set of five cubes that are no bigger than a matchbox, each with an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing the dice in a series before the time expires; it's great for competing in improvised making of words.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
To the best extent, two Webkinz and the Club Penguin Toys were represented in the toy stores.
For example, if you want to buy your child an online toy from the Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, the Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, 5$, for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the online code, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin store on any two items.
This could include, for example, roller skates or Puffle pet.
A little bigger than your toothbrush bracelet's bracelet is the Hexbug Nano (10$, for children from 5 years of age), the latest of a range of microrobots on a button battery.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in a random direction.
It's funny when you make a maze out of cubes and watch to see if he can find a way out.
It is also very resilient.
Ours was able to fall down with the kitchen table and spend even some time in the mouth of our dog.
Introducing a more subtle police check in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the square, strictly checking his orders and issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted female members - China's sturdy enforcer of the city order, feared and despised for their hard-working and discharges to do so - to convey a certain impression on a cluster of bystanders.
"Stand up straight!"
"Hurry!"
Show them, she whispers softly, "how do pretty girls look!"
Four very young girls wearing white gloves and the same olive coats and trousers came to attention.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted by a ruler.
Four headgear perfectly sits on the hair, which are perfectly bound by blue and white ribbons.
"Personally, I think they look average," Mr. Tang said disdainfully.
"The tributes are nice."
More than one government has sought to revive the image of the city's guards in China.
One city ordered the new conscripts to have a college degree.
Guangdong Province turned the gray-green uniforms into the supposedly more appealier blue.
Wuhan replaced the stares of heavy weaponry in central China: in 2009, one report said that 50 officers had appamously surrounded the shirt with snacks and stared at the owner until the door-to-door salesman packed up and left after half an hour.
Xindu, the city district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose the operation as the main picture.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its municipal police, who have been selected specifically to their appearance, symmetry and young age.
The aim is to show, in addition to the rough side of the police, a more subtle, female side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson herself would be in trouble to get into secret Chinese urban groups.
The critics would argue for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce the city ordinance, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely capture a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei province bludgeoned the detached viewer to death after using his cell phone to film, as they were acting in the crackdown protest.
Police officers were trained in Beijing last year, the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the internet. The manual included, among other things, a description of how to effectively beat the perpetrator with no blood sign.
This year, a door-to-door meloner in Shanghai got into a brawl with five police officers and suffered injuries to the left side of the brain.
One video game full of violence that can be downloaded online shows Chinese police officers attacking street sellers.
"Chengguan has startled the government," China Daily, the national edition, lamented last year after another discussion about tactics.
The paper said "really a thoroughly cleansing."
Skeptics say such an approach is not enough.
After the district advertised interest in eight new female female police officers in October, The Beijing Evening News editorial panel looked at the question of whether women had real duties or were merely a distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district demanded female applicants aged between the ages of 18 and 22 with a good build and "five facial features in the right proportion."
Adepts should have a height higher than the diameter - that is, more than 1.6 metres.
A service at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials say the job is mentally too demanding for women over 25.
"Their image is an important thing," an unnamed police officer said on Rednet.com, as a government website.
"The candidates must first demonstrate the external qualities, which are then determined by the others, including the height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the character and "internal quality."
Women are like flower vases, he said, adding, "In addition to being vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, the deputy director of the district's city leadership, disagrees with this description.
But he pointed out that height requirements are also common for other jobs in China, for both sexes.
As is the requirement for the face's corrective features.
Which means that the issue of good appearance is the subject of discussion among the Chinese.
Disabled or mutilations will certainly not apply.
"He cannot allow a lame or hump man to serve in our country," Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who is on patrol in Baoguang Square near the monastery, has 22 years old, faces like apples and a finely shaped mouth.
She doesn't think the emphasis on her appearance could be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her co-worker with dope, 21-year-old Xu Yang says "Our job is to represent the city's image."
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than merely banishing traders into the aisles where they can do their business.
Every morning, the group stands against the more than ten market-makers who are running around on foot or on bikes, trying to sell as many dumplings and tofu bowls as possible before being driven out.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've told you this many times!" said Miss Xu as the marketman started running, and left his wheelchair with the noodles cart for a time.
Police officers describe their duties as more monotonous than strenuous.
"Every day it's basically the same thing," said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying marketing on her day off.
"Big routine."
One reason is that female police officers do not have the powers of their male counterparts to confiscate the merchandise.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their male leaders.
The tendency is then to protect them from the sudden public manifestations of enmity against the official apparatus, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rebelled after false rumors spread that police officers had killed the vendor.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in the night hours; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu, meanwhile, has escaped such violence.
But peace can only be guaranteed.
Only two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where the policewomen were on patrol that morning, gathered at the corner of the street.
Officers seized a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of the store inside the store, as required by the regulations.
The bike owner could cry like he wanted.
15 minutes' left in front of the cops, looking angry, with his elbows on the vehicles, and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, the coordinator attached to the male group, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female police officers, the coordinators are men over 40 who already have only an auxiliary role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in the maintenance and smoothness of the image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said matter-of-factly.
"Most of it is the public who start it."
Prosecutors won't accuse Senator Ensign
Prosecutors at the Justice Department cleared Senator John Ensign about the criminal charges of his affair with a former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure the lobby, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat that Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican, has faced, and which, until the time of the scandal, has been considered a possible Republican presidential nominee for the year 2012 to be considered a possible Republican presidential nominee for 2012. His affair came into national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign, the Bureau said he was "certainly pleased with the decision that followed almost a yearlong investigation."
The senator could still face disciplinary action at the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice "informed us that Senator Ensign would no longer be the target of the investigation and that there was no plan to mount further charges against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice declined to comment on the case.
The decision came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department who argued that there was serious evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing to violate the federal lobby ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents, which were published in October 2009 in the New York Times, said that Mr. Ensign had assisted Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to secure a lucrative lobby to keep Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, the senator's affair with him.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer in the Ensignna campaign.
Mr Ensign contacted a number of political backers to find work for Mr Hampton and to support their views after Mr Hampton were hired to lobby them, so much to cite documents and interviews.
As Hampton was, until recently, Mr. Ensign, an assistant to Mr. Ensign, he was expelled by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts argue that the unusual settlement of Mr. Ensignhn and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, has arisen in violation of the lobby ban.
From the evidence that was released "it's revealed that this is a clear case of drafting a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawsuit specializing in defending clients who are under investigation by the government.
While Department of Justice officials declined to explain the reasons for the decision in Senator Ensignne's case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department was cautious about political lawsuits, after a large number of failures, including a decision last year to suspend a lawsuit against former Senator Ted Stevens in the midst of charges of misconduct by the prosecution.
Federal prosecutors "clearly hid the guns," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), a law firm that filed several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"It shows, in essence, that high-ranking government officials are not covered by the law," she added.
Paul Coggins, the chief attorney for Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a call from the Attorney's Attorney's Department of Justice on Monday and then the next day, and told him that the department had found no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense team is working with the prosecutors in an effort to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins declined to clarify the legal arguments he had given to the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable recounting the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to halt the investigation into a separate complaint in which the ethics group is filing allegations that Ensignna Hamptons' parents' payment of $96,000 violated the federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money meant nothing but a gift.
One company that Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbying job was NV Energy, the main non-Nazi company that had long supported the senator.
One December 2008 e-mail showed that after Mr. Hampton began serving as a lobbyist at the company, the senior staff manager of Mr. Ensigne - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him he was "whipped up" at the Home Office regarding the subject under discussion.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr Hampton and another Vylade client, Allegiant Air, and called on the Transport Minister to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr. Hampton for lobbying the job.
When the story of the affair first surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his post, as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After a months-long stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he planned to participate in his third term in the Senate.
In a report that Mr Ensign is no longer the target of the criminal investigation by his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped that the Ethics Committee would quickly follow the Justice Department and close the entire investigation.
"The Ensignator is looking forward to continuing his strenuous work in the name of the people of the Vysettles," she said.
Cheshire's appeal turns to Twitter
In the ranks of the courtroom, half a dozen of them wrote.
Minute a minute later, they sent reports of the gruesome testimony via Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 Twitter messages were covered in the rape and the introduction of children to the beds in the house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, the family, was to be held for an official end to the death penalty, for which the jury voted.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already appealed to the court with requests and arguments that would probably have been preoccupied by the court for years.
One of the most provocative is that intensive reporting of the process - including the widespread use of Twitter by the main reporters - created a "circus atmosphere" and this widespread, immediate penetration of information with outrageous details was then introduced by the jury in a decision to influence public opinion.
This claim could be forged by the judge to address the question of whether to require new rules in the courtroom as new technologies take the upset.
"As I experienced at this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair trial for the individual," said Thomas J. Ullmann, the chief defense attorney for Mr. Hayes.
Judge of the trial, Jon C. Blue of the State's High Court briefly rejected claims regarding last week's decree and that the media was "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence to point that the jury had acted under the influence of the public.
But this is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts have acknowledged that reporting on notorious cases may raise questions about the justice of the trial.
In a court order of 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of the Cleveland chiropractor, Dr. Sheppard herself for the murder of his wife, when he said in his decision that in the case of Sheppard v. Maxwell, this was a "carnival atmosphere" at the trial.
Some believe the crime was the inspiration for the TV show and the film "Refugee."
Some lawyers have said that the appellate courts, which reviewed the Hayes' ruling half a century later, might be surprised by the argument that new rules that determine the way in communication from the courtrooms could be necessary, which was in the case of Dr. Sheppard unimaginable.
"There is a general reason for concerns about the impact of new media" in high-profile cases, said John J. Donohue III, professor at the Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report saying it had been carried out at will.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be interested in the idea that restricting imminent communication from courtrooms can make the trial more just.
The Twitter case is only one of the many lawyers outlined by Mr. Hayes, who would be able to argue for years to delay the execution of the sentence.
Defenders also argue, for example, that in the case of Mr. Hayes, it may be a bias in that Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them criminal photographs of the horror at the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were appalled by the victims' photographs of the victims, appealed to Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and to Michael, 11.
Defenders claim that they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly appealed the juror, who was critical of prosecutors, and that his decision wrongly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think over the weekend.
The jurors were not separated.
But their arguments about the influence of the scope of the process can attract the most interest.
They said in an objection to a verdict last month that the case dominated the reports in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for the governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media kept stinging up the flames of emotion on the case.
"The daily rush of media, cameras and reporters in court," the lawyer wrote, "it was something that has not yet been seen here in New Haven, and may also be a nationwide rarity."
Their focus on Twitter's actions is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more outraged than the reports reported at a later date and, from their point of view, the judicial police should direct the scope of other trials.
But some lawyers have called for appellate courts with frequently used arguments that social and technological changes require the adaptation of the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are seeking this right.
In their archives, they referred to the Supreme Court's decision of the 1966 Supreme Court in the case of the Dr. Sheppard, because of the breadth of the process's action and wanted to clarify the demand that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "it represents the Sheppard versus 21st-century Maxwell case."
Can courtesy overcome the abyss?
After the campaign, which was notable for its insult and negativity, a small amount of courtesy emerged in Washington this week.
Is this the first swallow of true cooperation between two political parties, or merely an illusioning moment before a swift return to the party fight in the capital?
Tuesday's actions by President Obama and the parliamentary leaders produced no major discoveries of the major issues that must be discussed during the session.
But in any case, it was a polite discussion about the differences of opinion of two parties, as well as defining their shared responsibilities, rather than another blank episode of the party's struggle.
Wednesday's public session of the president's deficit commission was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that close cooperation for several months has built up mutual respect that transcends the ideological gulf that still divides members.
And it's kind of hard to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in the trial period - probing each other with signs of collegiality and compromise, seeking to assess the boundaries of public opinion and voter patience against the renewed party war.
That is why Tuesday's hearing and its later evaluation by the participants were also carried out with a minimum of requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between the Obama and the Republicans are too extensive and too deep to propose a rapid change in the circumstances that have prevailed here for the past two years.
Whether it's the issue of taxation, spending, health care or rights, the two sides are miles away.
Nevertheless, the November election was prepared by Washington, at least quickly.
"It's not a question of whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They are inevitable after the election.
The election roused the emotions of the partisans, and then they died out.
It's good."
On several issues, especially those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax cut expired at the end of the year, and no one sees it as favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them, both sides permanently or temporarily.
Like the likely compromise on unemployment benefits simply because Republicans cannot watch how they support a tax cut for the wealthy while rejecting unemployment benefits for the unemployed.
After Tuesday's White House meeting, there is already more optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, together with the ratification of the new Initiation Treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution points out that successful cooperation on major issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship of two political parties when the 112th congress convenes in January.
Rather, it is likely a period of disagreements, or even inevitable, he said.
"After doing things that must be done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in a short view," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely widespread - to the fact that courtesy will lead them to be real cooperation.
"I look at all events between the present and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will occur in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely linked to the formation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of exaggeration, know that they must behave according to their promises and must cut the government's spending and repeal the new health care law.
These adherence lines are clear in the initial responses to the recommendations on the deficit, which include reforming the tax code and an increase in some taxes, an increase in the retirement age and a reduction in spending.
The Joint Speakers, chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, have taken on one of the toughest challenges in Washington, and are, in their view, to put pressure on the deficit issues to the public program in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to present their plan as an official recommendation and thus fight to get as close as possible to the figure.
The biggest opposition is among the elected panel officials, who suggest that in the case of financial issues we have, at least today, a small foundation or a will for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and the parliamentary Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflicts, with Republicans calling on Obama to address the budget, taxes, and health care, when a period of more party cooperation will be followed.
What causes a shift?
Public opinion.
There is much evidence that despite the party's partisanship at the last election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties that work together.
If it could be directed to the heel, as it was in 1995, then both sides will be watching the public's reactions very closely.
Anyone at risk of reducing the votes, he will probably change the course and seek a compromise.
This may be an optimistic view of the matter.
Stranicking and directing are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that a larger ideological gap between Obama and Parliament's Republicans has emerged than it was for Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that emerged this week would be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will cost many efforts on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A striking American documentary portrays Moscow as a haven for corruption
The city's management is in the hands of the "kleptokracie" and it continues with a portion of the bribes and bribe for the protection that come to the Kremlin on the way to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in records from February.
Police and Federal Security Service largely hold protective wingers to help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legal trades but also from organised criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "twist of the office" - will take his tos when the money starts to move up the ladder.
The footage, which was sent to Washington under the name of ambassador to John Beyrle, was posted on WikiLeaks' website on Wednesday.
The footage is based on the sources whose names were redacted.
The footage was written at a time when Yuri Luzhkov was mayor, accusing him of a large part in the corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only follow minimal changes in purification.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelen Baturin, who owns a prominent design firm, have consistently denied corruption charges for many years, and won several lawsuits for false accusations for such accusations.
He told a Russian television station in September when he was asked about proven evidence of corruption: "It's crazy, it's filth, it's crap."
The Russians, with absolute conviction, believe that if their society is corrupt, it will turn out to be a vote.
But it is unusual to meet such details in such a way, in the embassy report, and it is also unheard of for diplomats to do so.
"The government of the city of Moscow and its association with the criminal elements led some to call it 'dysfunctional,' and confirm that the government works more like a kleptocracy than as a government," the report says.
"Criminal elements enjoy the so-called 'crushha' (a term from the world of jail and mafia, which literally means 'roof' or protection), provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Public Prosecutor's Office, as well as everywhere in the government's bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"The Analytiks have identified and the three-stage structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"The Federal Security Service, the Ministry of the Interior and the militias are in the second level."
"And finally, at the lowest level, there are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill in the blanks in some areas as the city does not provide some services."
The report says the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies and the police are targeting smaller businesses.
One source said, "the owners of the shops in Moscow are aware that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (rather than from organized criminal groups) as they have not only more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer on the course."
The record says that while the withdrawal of money is comprehensive, the protection itself may already be in trouble; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
For those who do not pay quickly enough, their business is closed under various pretexts.
Medvedev spoke several times about the fight against corruption, but admitted that he had made only a little progress.
The bass report speaks of men taking suitcases, probably packed with cash, to the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of the Moscow research team, said in a recent interview.
"But it is part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because there are no longer political classes in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without the separation of powers, corruption is inevitable, he said.
The Indo's estimate that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year to become nationally.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by NGOs Transparency International (the countries ranked from at least the most corrupt).
The unveiling of the U.S. Embassy's report, which appeared in Moscow in the late evening, certainly did not elicit enthusiasm with the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov may be charged for Moscow's shortcomings, may be a chance for the Kremlin to argue about a solution to the problem.
In an interview with CNN with Larry King, Putin told us that the documents that WikiLeaks released may have been fakes and responded angrily to a statement that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedeva Robin.
"The truth about the whole matter is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such coercion, you know, so unethically."
The Khmer Rouge vets are forced to come to terms with the past
In a scantily lit concrete classroom with its soiled and peeled walls, the school's director, Anlong Veng High School, recalled the man who had built it, the leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Moka."
"He was a good leader and he cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as a "cutter" for his savagery during the Khhmer Rouge, the commander remains popular in this remote-held Khhmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to rule, there is a broken long-lasting loyalty in Anlongengan as well.
In April, the victims at the forum of truth and reconciliation were allowed to publicly confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that for the first time explain to children the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers.
And in July, together, the UN and the Cambodian court to call on the first conviction of the former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the former leader, the notorious abusive association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Ghost, to 35 years in prison.
With each such progress, the unrest of the Khmer Rouge veterans in Anlong Veng grew, complicating the efforts to reconcile and their attempts to re-engage in Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodia documentation center, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"For them, life among the Khmer Rouge was a beautiful one, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It separates the families."
During the Khmer Rouge administration in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or starved to death, from disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese attacked and overthrew the reign of Pol Pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sara ran guerrilla warfarean wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlongen.
But in the mid-1990s, after the peace agreement, sponsored by the UN, the country was led to the first democratic election in 1993. Large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to move to a government that culminated in the surrender of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who persevered, was captured by government forces in the underwater mountains of Dangrek in the late mountains.
He died in Phnom Penh Prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their benefactors were no longer caring for them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters had fallen into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically remember the time of the movement.
Although several of the elite Khmer Rouge have held their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unqualified farmers.
"These people only benefited at the capitolatum," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which is led by public forums across Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by the regime's utopone agrarian ideology."
"They were manners without any idea of doing business."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlongenway before settling as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Rouge Khmer was good," he said.
"This Mok fed them all."
"But now life is hard, for we must provide for ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Court also raised concerns.
Earlier next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the chief of the reign of the developers and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will also continue in the four cases.
It was little to be reassured by the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chao, 64, who was the regional leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the documentation center in Cambodia that she oversaw the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that was likely to have killed thousands of forced workers.
On a recent hot evening, Im Chaem returned from her field work to her wooden cottage on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and shadows appeared across the arid grasses, Imhem refused to speak of her past among the Khmery Rouge.
If the court called it in, she would refuse to go.
"Supply, peace reigns in and it is stable," she said.
"If there are any more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978 also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court sought out more suspects, though experts and historians disagree.
"The Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confronting the past is only what Cambodia has to do to move forward, Chhang Youk of the documentation center said.
"Recones in Khmer conditions means gluing to broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together to understand."
The center published the first textbook approved by the Khmer Rouge government, it is 75 pages long and the name "The History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addendum to the history book of the Ministry of Education, which contains fewer than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As with many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng also knew few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's association with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at a high school in Anlong Veng said the new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took home a book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But public forums, textbooks and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
The Khmer Rouge still have a strong charm here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains, the Dangrek Mountains is a journey overgrown with weeds and dumped in discarded plastic bags that lead to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusted tin roof.
The body of Pol Pot was burned here in a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone saleswoman on the side of the road said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated at the scene.
"But he has a strong spirit, many of the locals come here and pray to him," she said.
It was N Nuom Sothea's birthday, and she had planned to visit Pol Pot's resting place later, where she would bring a bundle of riphed bananas in the hope that it would bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to find its uranium-based stockpiles of weapons
In a surprise victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that they will renounce their stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was made public in a joint statement, issued after the Security Summit by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
The US government has spent years trying to persuade Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and appeared to have hit a stumbling block last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that in the last two months, a couple of classified operations have been conducted with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
This set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - around £500, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, at which Belarus was scrapped.
And it was apparently a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the subsequent 2012 summit.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the Nuclear Safety Summit2012."
"This proves the process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear safety group.
Clinton called the agreement a "very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in June 2009 to secure all sensitive nuclear materials worldwide within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to get rid of all its high-enriched uranium stockpiles.
Belarus will be the seventh.
Tucet countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for the weapon and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said afterwards.
"It's our commodity...We're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
Nevertheless, Belarus joined the United States a few months ago and signaled its interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated as the material was slightly irradiated, officials announced.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was conducted by air, officials said.
The US government spent $13 million on the program, most of it on the supply of a Belarusian research institute less enriched uranium, which is not suited for the production of nuclear weapons.
"Everything has been coordinated very carefully and controlled on the basis of trust," which led to a deal signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official in the Department of Energy working for Global Threat Reduction.
This year, the James Martin Martin Center, to study nuclear-proliferation, estimated that Belarus had at least £88 of uranium usable for weapons production.
Belarus will, according to the Joint Statement, seek to withdraw its stockpiles by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's cruel repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of gradual melting.
"We welcome progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that more rigorous respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving relations and it is necessary for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government has not made a dearly deal with CIA flights
The Spanish government was not at a cost to the work of the CIA's flights carrying the imprisoned talibans and members of Al-Qaida to Guantánamo across the Spanish territory, as the United States envoy to Madrid said in its telegram.
This is the implication from the documents provided by Wikileaks to El País, which also says that then-Froneral Chimea Teresa Fernández de la Vega asked for the Spanish executive to be informed and "so show that it is properly supervised by foreign aircraft passing through the Spanish airspace."
In June 2006, following a communication from the Council of Europe in which a dozen states, including Spain, were charged with complicity in human rights violations, a meeting took place between the US ambassador, Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The deputy prime minister said the message of the Council of Europe 'distinished the Zapater's government out of the game' and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in the matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain has no problem with flights of secret services through its territory.
"They simply want to be informed" so that they are not "fished unprepared," Aguirre says in one of the documents.
The then Minister of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also suggested to the US ambassador that the Spanish government "did the matter wanted to give the floor as low as possible, but by the fact that the matter was in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited possibilities of influence."
In February 2007, prosecutor Vice President González told the Embassy that he had no intention of blocking the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence concerning CIA flights if it was concerned.
"This information contains no incriminating file or any sensitive information," the Embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the US has expressed concerns for" the obvious coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" than because of the declassification of information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to address this case discreetly between governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the lunch of US Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfred Pérez Rubalcaba, he told this ambassador that "although Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they think is appropriate," he has already instructed his coworkers to give instructions to his coworkers, "let them avoid the uproared comments with the intention of reducing tensions."
The ambassador also expresses his concerns about the negotiations of the political party Partido Popular (PP; Czech People's Party).
"Despite its widespread pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Partido Popular party will not hesitate to take advantage of any hints that the Zapatera government tolerated or intentionally ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations could have negative consequences for the United States government," he notes.
Confirmed mother-in-worry complained on the net on maternal "disaster"
The young woman was talking about the baby when he was already dead, and she had her blog: "Teror in Galicianka"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández calls herself "Muki" online.
with this nickname, which she had used since she was a child, communicated with her cousin and at least one friend; the two of them are from the village of Noia in the area of La Coruňa, from which the young woman comes.
Reports are from 2008.
In order to be able to understand them, it is necessary to know the woman's emotional life, which is reconstructed by the ABC with the help of the testimony of its family members.
A 30-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with the industrialist Iván Túnez in 1998.
They went out for one year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn child was his, but his ex-girlfriend never had his DNA tests done.
Soon she found a new acquaintance.
Her chosen one was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their coexistence took a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl left for a job in the Balearic Islands, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to see her for a week at the Palma.
However, the content of her communication shows that the relationship has broken down.
In March 2008, she's alone on Menorca, writing, "Alberto is some angry that I left for work."
"When I told him, it seemed good to him, but now he realizes that he has to be with the little one all day and can't do what he wants."
Then she talks about the text message she's just got: 'I want you to come back this month or give me the address to send you a child'.
He complains: "If he doesn't like me leaving my little one with my mother, I'll marry him when I get back," he claims.
in May he talks about his return to his residence: 'I'm going there this week, but I'll only stay until the 19th, '20s, because I have to go for the job so I don't miss the job'.
He explains that if all goes well, he will take his son in with him.
"She'll be with who she's supposed to be with, and I'll never be with me, and it's never going to happen again that I'll let him with someone else with someone besides my mother," a dubious intention given her bad relationships.
there's another post in July.
When he taps out of this message, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month and was probably murdered 10am is already dead.
"César is happy on the one hand, but on the other hand he's not."
"On the one hand he's with me, and he kind of likes it here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day."
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He'll go there (son) to summer school, so I'll save a little money for the nanny."
Seventeenth regards and complaints.
"A big kiss from Caesar that asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to email, look at the look he wants, he's meeting with me, sex is needed."
Thirteenth next message: 'The boy is well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan's.
There is also a report on Víctor, the current partner: "He gives me money."
On the internet, Mónicca's posts are made on blogs dedicated to anime and manze.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she used to be called "Muki Ex-prisoness."
"Teror in Galician (motto) ".
The last man with whom she lived, the guard, expresses his pity and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, where she arrived from the Menoroornic detention centre.
The defense attorney, Carlos Maceda, said the defendant could not remember how everything happened and "that she had no intention of harming the little one."
Earlier, however, she admitted that she had drowned César in the bathtub and put his body in the trunk.
Both the defense and the prosecutor are requesting a psychiatric evaluation.
The People's Party would win 4 seats in the House and the PSC (Socialist Party of Catalonia) would lose 9 seats
with the results of 28 November, the PP side could have the lead at the town halls in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in votes won and the number of experienced MPs during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan's PP (Katalania People's Party) already has a given idea of the general election, whether or not there is an increase, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in the national elections is usually one of those compared to the Catalan elections.
in 2008 the Catalan People's Party won the general election by 610,473 votes, while in the Autonomous elections in the 2006 Autonomous elections the figure was only 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC (Katalan People's Party) received a vote of 384,091 with a vote.
If this tendency of upward, supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP voters, the analysts of this party have calculated that if the general election is held, the PPC could receive 12 Members in the House as opposed to the existing 8, CiU (Convergencia i Unió, Czech Republic of the Union - note) would also receive 4 mandates (now it has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 seats (now it has 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of crucial importance for the PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this Peoples' Peoples' Analysis, the ERC (Left Republican Republican Party) would lose one MP - now it has 3 - while the JGA's (Green Initiative for Catalonia) would continue to have one mandate, or won another one.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the next rehearsal will be held in May 2011 on the occasion of the municipal elections, where the people could also have a decisive influence on the end of the Socialist domination in the four main provincial cities, as well as the changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the largest projected budget - 661 million euro for 2011.
Both nationalists and the Peoples agree with the possibility that the PSC could lose the town hall in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérona and Gerona, where the Socialists would not receive a majority and could not even turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and ICV parties.
Given the Republican debacle, it would be impossible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona City Council - as a minimum of 5% of the vote must be won.
The PP has increased the number of votes won in the four capitals and could have decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragorona.
Nationalists believe they could play a major role in the turnaround in Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP party in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
in Lérida, the PP won only 500 votes more than the PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, has had a very good relationship with Marian Rajoy - they met on several occasions during the last campaign.
The People's Party also won at other major town halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels and Reus.
currently has a presence at 34 town halls in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
Catalan cell grants Al-Qaeda to thousands of passports
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, three more were detained in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and a Nigerian who had been detained by the agents of the General Information Committee in Barcelona were a jihadi cell run from Thailand that arranged the passports for various groups of the Al-Qaeda organization, including the "Tigers of the Liberation of Tamil's Ilam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba," with the latter being the author of the bombings in Bomai, in which 106 people were killed in 2008.
The Interior Ministry attaches great importance to the investigation of the matter, aiming to ensure the weakening of the Al-Qaeda counterfeiting at international level with the "Operation of Kampai" and "restricting its operational capabilities" by "restricting its operational capabilities."
Investigators estimate that the cell could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand during the two years of active in Catalonia, where they were then forged and then supplied to groups that make up the criminal galaxy of the Al-Qaeda organization so that their "fighters" could travel across borders in Europe and other Western countries with impunity.
This broken cell was not the only active one that the jihad network had in Europe, and therefore other European police units were also involved in these investigations in addition to the Thai services, and it cannot be ruled out that there will be no similar interventions in other European countries in the days ahead as the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), another developed in Thailand in which Pakistanis Mohammad Athad Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thajec Sirianlaya Kijbumru were capturedng.
It was these men who ran a cell based in Spain and others in other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network, part of which was liquidated in 2009, stole, in particular, travel passports from tourists that met the demands of the Islamists.
This means that the documents had to belong to the men aged 25 to 45, they had to have valid for several years and be free of marked visas.
The investigative documents stress that no facts are yet to be known to link the detainees from Catalonia to the assassination in Mumbai, even though the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba," was to be one of the groups that accepted the passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before this assassination, a transfer agency of about $1,000 was sent from a transfer agency by a transfer agency that was "entered" to buy mobile phone cards that were later used by members of the "command" that killed 106 people.
Police have already seized a lot of evidence.
People's Party (PP) demands from Mas to stop fiscal agreement
The president of the PPC (Katalan People's Party), Alicia Sánchez-Camach, had the opportunity yesterday to present to Arthur Masov personally her terms and conditions under which she is willing to support his induction as president of the Generalitat; these terms are identical to those proposed during the campaign, and their priority is to revitalise the economy and renounce risky businesses such as the economic agreement that the nationalist leader wants to propose during his mandate.
The chairwoman of the Catalan Peoples came to the meeting with Arturo Mas with the certainty of the 18 seats received in last Sunday's election, a figure of more than satisfactory for gaining approval, so the CiU candidate needs at least one of the formations making up for the opposition to abstain from voting to appoint him to take office.
The possible consensus with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists would like to keep in the House when the general election is held, but so far the talks on the talks on the rest of the political leaders are in the Catalan spirit these days.
As for the president of the PP, to get her support for her inaugurated, "she will have to end all sovereign and liberation speeches," as well as an economic agreement - similar to the one from the Basque Country - which the CiU leader even wanted to let vote in a referendum.
The two leaders would like to downsize the bloated political apparatus of the autonomous administration's rampant and reduce inheritance and gift taxes.
Details of the negotiations regarding Mas's inauguration will be addressed within the PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised tough opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV), and will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Alberto Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatrics facility assures that the deaths were not due to the "lack of a measure"
Introductions of the Olot centre do not rule out that their carer killed more than 11 clients
The management of the La Caritat de Olot (Geron) geriatric centre gave a press conference yesterday to describe the damage to the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, a caregiver who - having been employed here in the meantime - killed at least eleven of the elderly in the care of him.
The director of this senior home, Joan Sala, arrived accompanied by a lawyer at the facility, Joan Canada's lawyer, and announced that "wishing for La Caritat's home would be to be able to bring charges against the culprit" responsible for the killing, but "the law and responsibility oblige us to leave this to the relevant authorities."
In addition to the reputational damage suffered by this institution because it did not reveal the criminal activities of the carer in a timely manner, the major threat to the home of La Caritat is now a major threat to the Material Compensation, which is already calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the bereaved families.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime occurred in August 2009 and that he has not stopped killing since
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies of the clients of the home for the elderly, suspecting that in many cases no doctor had inspected the deceased personally, but that - due to the patients' age and ill health - everything was done over the phone.
La Caritat resolutely rejected this extremes yesterday through its director, stressing that "lack of action could not have been the reason for this, which had happened."
The attorney at La Caritat added that "on the case is no indication that any third party has committed an error other than the accusedelf."
The man now nicknamed the "Angel of Death" admitted to killing 11 yesterday, clarifying that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and killed a second old woman a month and a half later.
in this case, he caused death by administering an overly high dose of insulin, as opposed to the first time he used a mixture of tranquilizer pills.
The director of La Caritat said it was complicated to check the staff's access to the medication.
Insulin and seduce costar were probably six times out of the nine by the device the carer used to kill patients in his efforts to relieve their suffering.
However, it is only the analyses that are now taking place in the laboratory that should show whether Vila is lying and actually sought a less cruel death for his first victims or, on the contrary, killed them by adminoming the lye, as he has already admitted in the case of the three women killed between the ages of 12 and 17. October.
in La Caritat, they do not believe in the health claims and do not rule out that the number of those killed may be higher than he has admitted to, and they justify their behaviour in various versions filed by Vila to the court in the knowledge that he must change his actions when it became clear that he had killed eight people.
That is why they say they want to be available to the judiciary to illuminate the full scope of this matter.
European Central Bank threatens
Investors responded sharply yesterday to the threat of President of the European Central Bank of Trichet yesterday, warning that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
Fringe differentials closed with force, and European banks' stock fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank's ability to be wrong - the euro has just risen above critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the illiquid market, which, although there is a decline, is recovering - but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
It will take the investor some time to lose his concern.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us as saying that it would be in return to its liquidity rate today, and tomorrow it would have to be called off for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank called for the closure of the plan to buy the national debt to be used for the ineffectiveness and to eliminate all exceptional liquidity measures within the deadline, leaving unrestricted access for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate to be predicted 'at least until March' and to comply with a three-month non-accessic bidding by the end of this trimester to guarantee liquidity until at least in June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond-buying programme and even announce its intensification.
If the expectations created are not fulfilled, it will re-establish the reaction of the markets from yesterday, and if they continue to blindly continue to withdraw the liquidity rate, God be with us!
It was the same at the congress in May, where they said they had not even considered buying bonds, and the markets collapsed - tomorrow, history could repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
in May, the armored fist announced it on Monday and said on Wednesday that it had already purchased many, triggering another market collapse.
Yesterday's bidding of one-year bills in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro only issued 500 million with 5.28%, compared to the 750 million with 4.81% of the previous one.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell 30 points lower, reflecting a change in the mood on the market which took place after the words of Trichet.
the figures were published in Ireland the figures represent the losses of Allied and the Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent some 10,000 million in short-term securities and another potential 15,000, with a chance to become private capital by February, otherwise they will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after the problem was not detected by stress tests in July, the sums are acceptable under the auxiliary plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will need to get the approval of the new budget by parliament and still not have enough support, so there continues to be uncertainty in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has softened the tone of her speech to ease the tension in the face for the next meeting of the EU leaders on 14 December, at which a political compromise is needed to show that we are a union and we are all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while the others would prefer the Beethoven's Day of Joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister yesterday had the opportunity to present a plan for a measure that will be approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, reduction of deficit, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to boost employment - it sounds like the Four seasons from Vivaldi.
The dual effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish Stock Exchange rose by 4.5%, i.e. double that of other European stock exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish National Bank was swift and convincing - we are probably benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today we have a key three-year bond licit, which will be favoured by the Trichet effect, which we hope, for which, we hope, there will be a great demand to help dispel the doubts about our refinancing ability.
Requiring a rescue plan would be for Spain to take self-sacrifice.
They'd give us the cash we don't need - there's 40,000 million in cash available at El Tesoro, three times more than in March - higher rates, and market access would close to sine die.
However, the strategy of Cesar's woman should continue to be used - "not only to be that, but also to seem so."
We'll do it.
Eulen Group president contests Vega Sicilia meeting requested by his children
The storm in open conflict in the Álvarez family, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro, is not dwindling.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, contests him after being accepted as "completely insignificant," El Enebro's legal act planned for the 16th of this month and the requested five of his seven descendants, on which they should try to force their majority and seize the pro-procurrency of Bodegas, the company Vodegas Sicilia, with the help of the administrative authorities.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are fine-tuning the legal group for a new chapter in their dispute over the control of part of society.
The founder of the largest holding company services does not seem willing to slack off his dispute over membership in the ruling bodies of El Enebro.
Five of its conscripts were deposed on its seven descendants, named leaders during a shareholders' assembly on 18 January this year and whose objection is made in the Commercial Register.
The El Enebro group's court hearing, scheduled for the 16th of this month, which was convened by the official of the Court of Commons 2 in Madrid, has restored the thunder in the womb of the Álvarez family.
Appalling the judges is the only legal means to guarantee the commission to convene pending the dispute.
The final move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Martha and Elvira Álvarez's Mezquirezs is seen by David Álvarez as "a desperate means of his five children serving through judicial guise and a clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the conduct of January 18, which was completely invalid."
This line of argument will serve as a basis for the justification for the legal challenge to the conduct of this conduct as "completely insignificant."
The protagonists themselves, who are discreetly silent, have already attempted to convene a hearing without success for the court in June.
in El Enebro, a group owned alongside other activities by Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls seven descendants of David Álvarez with 100% of the capital.
However, according to the family protocols, the founder of the group demands a right to use the right to use at 51% of the capital.
This matter is a key issue that the judge will have to decide when he exposes the issue of a court challenge to the hearing. The date of this trial has not yet been set.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula One with a secret weapon from Siemens
The software suggests real-time improvement in vehicles.
Ever since Red Bull invaded the Formula One series in 2004, its history in this exceptional world of speed has been characterised by surprise and success.
At first, no one took the options of this newcomer team very seriously, and despite the upward trend of recent times, everyone was betting on the triumph of Ferrari Fernando Alonso.
Without wishing to diminish the chipper's ability of the champion, German Sebastian Vettel, or the Renault engine's capabilities that propel his car, a legend was born in the world of Formula One - a "secret weapon" that the multi-ethnic Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to make him a winning team.
In fact, these are powerful software simulating the marches that the German company launched in 2007 for the purposes of very remote automotive sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to design mounting lines in manufacturing plants around the world, in energy plants and for high-timerable devices.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is realised, thus avoiding unnecessary errors and expenses.
The PLM has facilitated the development of the Canon, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most renowned commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this software device allowed the Red Bull team to make the Red Bull team "during a few hours, in near-real time" modifications and improvements that otherwise detect themselves during races and trials.
Russwurm says that in 1992, the stables employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four improvements in a single period.
on the Red Bull team, there are now 180 young, highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology to analyze and design each type of modification of racing vehicles.
The manager of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyse and improve all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles with the exception of the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features are being modeled.
Changes can be translated from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using laser and highly technologically advanced autoclave.
The only limit of this technical achievement is the $40 million maximum that each Formula One team can spend for each period to improve their competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a high-tech plant about 50 km from London to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings in which visitors are restricted - especially to journalists.
Everything that takes place here is considered a "big secret."
The list of participants in this project consists of 580 people, including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull is without a doubt fresh champion Sebastian Vettel in Formula One.
But the immeasurable technological means of technology that the brand of energy drinks has put into its participation in the racing circuits are lurking with other protagonists whose help is invaluable, and yet no one knows them.
The head of the manufacturing technology, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it was possible to say that advances in vehicle research and development contributed to a 50% victory and the rest was due to the riders.
currently this ratio has changed and the technology is worth the successes of 85%, while the pilots are contributing 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing, as they are "unpredictable gladiators."
HP will set up 20 of its own stores over two years in cooperation with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in collaboration with its business partner Pont Reyes inaugurated its first exclusive shop in Barcelona yesterday.
The company will be the first of a network of 20 stores of 80 to 100 m2 that the multinational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing department stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of Spain's HP, Helena Herrer, cited the newly converted store for Barcelona's Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for 30 years, as an example.
The North American company has set up a plan to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first outlets were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and in Belgrade (Serbia), so the business in Barcelona is the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal where other stores would be opened, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the following locations.
Herrero, who also runs HP's staffing systems, assured that the philosophy of opening stores would always be the same - using local distributors who have the experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company is advising here on the exclusive design of the equipment of the outlets (with products that can be interactively tested) that will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also involved in providing staff for shops.
Helena Herrer denied that it was a franchising process, stressing that the exclusive network of outlets aims to "improve customer service, services to SMEs when buying, service to small and medium-sized enterprises, service, after-sales service."
The shop in Barcelona is part of a world-class pilot pioneer programme to address potential problems with the safe-guaranteed computer devices.
Online service is linked to a technical centre based in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"Then we'll be able to solve problems in 10 minutes that might take up to two days otherwise."
"This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, as large firms already have contractual technical assistance service," Helena Herreroová stressed yesterday.
Sabadell is betting that he will "stolen" to his competitors over three years
More optimistic than other bosses, delegated board member Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be challenging for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts an end to the passive war.
Nevertheless, it envisages a reduction in interest rates, which they will seek to compensate by discounting bank fees and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to raise a million private clients in three years.
Sabadell found a way to take advantage of the next three years to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan in 2011 with effect from three years.
The aim, in addition to surviving without having to turn to public assistance at FROB, to gain market share by capturing a million new private clients - and 700,000, respectively, if those who eventually leave the bank are deducted - as until now, the institute rather cherished small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large businesses than retail clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share is 3.5% for private clients, compared to more than 10% for corporate customers.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or sobriety, in order to reduce costs, the challenges of which will be shown by the Bank when it presents the results for the period.
At this time, a number of banking institutions are daring to set targets and disclose them, as the financial crisis has changed all world banking plans.
Sabadell will close its Optima program this year, set four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the market situation required an extension for the next period.
Clients who leave the savings banks will be their main target group.
At the APIE meeting, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "heavy and very important."
Indeed, he believes that the road from the crisis in Spain will be "truffling."
In addition, it will be "very difficult to create employment" in two or three years, which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And while he believes that a passive war - which reduces margins - is taking back, the cost of the risk surcharic that banks and savings banks and savings banks pay for their issues to receive liquidity are already shifting to the prices of loans, thus offsetting the margin cuts.
"The liquidity and financing theme is structural and will be a coercive factor for loans."
"We haven't closed the tap yet, but the differentials are very high," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto has already issued orders to its network on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and increase the prices of differentialies - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking "is now being commissions is to reduce commissions," but there is a "competitive framework."
The Sabadell Bank's strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual the group does not rule out corporation operations.
It is not for nothing that he assures that in Spain "they will be required to be of larger sizes."
"Next year there will be no stone left on the stone," he assured.
It confirms that the needs of capital are "a reduced" and does not exclude that some Spanish institution will enter the red numbers.
And it points out that FROB can substitute for fund-raising in the market before the new capital measure.
Assurance that Sabadell may survive a temporary market shutdown, a serious problem continues to be what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it is not possible to issue, but unlike what was in June, short-term funding can be received using repo rates, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA rules out the next wave of savings bank mergers
The CECA Director General yesterday rejected the creation of another wave of savings bank mergers and again insisted on the speed with which the sector reorganised is being carried out.
When the Spanish savings banks' association process started, there were several institutions that assured that they would not take part in this first phase and wait for the second round.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Savings Banks (CECA) of the Spanish Savings Bank (CECA) yesterday ruled out that a new wave of these operations should be created.
"I believe that most of the merges have already been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as the second round, what is happening is the conventions."
"Most of them are completely implemented; we may go to 13 or 14 instead of 17 institutes, but all major processes are already done and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has cooperated very well on this matter," the director noted.
In his statements at the ADEA meeting (Association of Leaders and Executive Officials, Aragon) Olavarrieta described the fact that the concentration process takes place "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as is shown in the repayments that have appeared in the business plans with the Spanish National Bank in their time, not now," he stressed.
"Going from 45 savings banks with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 175,500 million with 75,500 million is a process that has no history of comparison, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to make them larger and thus underline in line with the Basel Treaty.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of not-so-happy opinions about the slowness of the process" that show "lack of seriousness and understanding" because "it's what the National Bank of Spain is doing is a reminder that we have to be in the run-up to the end of the year."
CECA CEO José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain has the strictest financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who question it "lack of knowledge."
The director noted that in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be calm" about financial institutions and savings banks as well as a system that has mastered the "very important" concentration process and which continues at "the highest possible speed."
He also recalled that Spanish banking came out very well from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and red German line
Berlin decided to maintain the euro, but set the conditions for the whole of the Union.
Tensions in the markets provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, from tax cuts for SMEs, to regulating private intermediation agencies or the abolition of 426 euros for the unemployed without benefits, to the privatisation of 49% AENA (Spanish airports and air traffic management), airport administrators Barajas and El Prat and 30% state lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel over her responsibility to start the current crisis.
How to interpret these moves?
It should be said in advance that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redefinition of the euro.
And here, Germany has a radically new vision of what its future is supposed to be, alluding to the idea of adhering to old traditions adhering to a large proportion of other members.
In the face of European resistance, there is speculation in Germany of three possible journeys from the crisis.
The first is a strong eurozone, which would include Germany, but also Austria or the Netherlands, for example, while the southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is a return to the mark - although it may now appear to be scifi, this version has broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to the German proposals, is the re-election of the euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary aritness, fines for offending states, possible deferrals of payments for some of them, and with the extension of possible regulatory costs to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is no room for evicues now.
First, when both the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission were fuelled with deficits in 2009, the German government pulled a constitutional reform out of its sleeve to prevent them from happening in 2016.
This was the first sign of contradiction between what Germany thought was right (fiscal austerity and stability plans) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second was shown by this Central European country, when Merkel painfully delayed the decision to save Greece.
It was already the subject of harsh criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion, which was also published, were strongly against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel reappeared with a clear view of the prescription, demanding that the European Union's conventions be reformed so as to allow a Member State to be rescued, while allowing private creditors to bear part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European as it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although in a somewhat ablewheld form, has been approved, and over the coming months we should monitor the Union's reform process, which should allow for these measures from 2013.
Germany has set out a red line that it is not going to cross.
And he is telling us all that, although measures need now need to be taken that he seems to be very opposed to, from that date the old functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will represent the birth of a new currency zone in which states in the breach of the rules will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to announce the deferral of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany is suggesting that we need to be given a rigorous path of growth with an increase in the saving and investment rate, moderate consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, and capital buffers.
A different option, based on receivables and building, with the enormous gaps in the balance of payments that prevailed in the years of the Spanish growth boom, is simply not intended to be tolerated.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
This is not just about resuming the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want us to do is a lot tougher.
And the worst part is that under these conditions, we might be mistaken for ourselves.
I hope this current turbulence will be replaced by more calm.
And that we would take the opportunity they give us until spring 2013.
Prime Minister Zapatero also seems to have understood this, and his double-declared statement (promoted after the meeting with the big business of last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of the new measures) suggests that, despite the critics of Merkel, the path has been opened up to the idea that things need to be put right.
But the red line that Germany has set out is here, and it doesn't seem to want to move it.
And from the options to be considered, the exit of the eurozone full of not-so-serious countries cannot be excluded.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it has warned us.
Sport and circumventing the rules
The phints of the kindled by Alonso and Ramos in the Ajax match show a wit not an intention to escape punishment.
The presumed derailments of two Real Madrid players (Xabi's Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League match against Ajax on 23 November caused a sea of ink to be called up on whether or not this is unsportsmanlike conduct, and whether, eventively, UEFA should punish the two footballers.
As is well known, a few minutes before the end of the game (which their team had a clear win) one by one, the players on purpose were deliberately wasting their time when the foul was about to be played to provoke the referee, who showed them a second yellow card.
In this way, both players will complete their prescribed penalty in the following match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid finishing in the lead - and will be able, cleared of the cards, to continue to the next stage.
In the end, UEFA's disciplinary committee awarded coach Jose Mourinho a two-game suspension and the offending players were fined in cash.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is no new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, the rules that are unwritten but watch.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that its participant was the Real Madrid team (which boast of generosity and honour in its anthem, and who has already fined its players for similar acts), and, it seems, thanks to a dramatisation led by Mourinho, who is thus adding another episode to its long history of the comedian and provocateur.
in any event, the debate revolves around whether this type of conduct, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is to say, whether these acts are circumvented by the law; indeed, these are actions respecting the sporting rules, the meaning of which, however, it seems they seek to circumvent.
It is a question of what type of damage such actions are in a sporting spirit.
One of the essentials of sporting behaviour is the physical inviolability of the opposing players, which has not been violated in these cases, or there has been no violent play.
Another of these formalities characterising the clean game is to avoid players having an advantage over the opponent's team because of their misdemeanor - which has not happened here either.
Ironically, then, at the action of the players in Real Madrid, the fact that there was no realisation of what we normally characterise as a ruse or circumvention of the law, there was no covert breach of the rules in order to avoid the penalty, but this behaviour should have been as noticeable as possible in order to receive the penalty.
They waited and were happy to receive the punishment.
But the other question is what advantage the culprits will have of their deliberate offence.
It must be stated here that the opponent is not in a disadvantaged position, and that he will not achieve any benefit in the current match, as the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next game, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage is clearly that the players will start the next stage of the Champions League without cards, which could jeopardise their participation in the future match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a degree of uncertainty, that is, at first glance, the team can be eliminated, and beyond that, the players will take away from the penalty, and they go to the second round of the cards, in which one less card is enough to be eliminated than in the first round.
So as the bikes continue, it will not be entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations do not go against the sporting spirit, which includes making strategic decisions that will make it possible to obtain the maximum benefit within the rules.
in the case we are dealing with here, the players were not to avoid the granting of the penalty (which would be a clear case for circumventing the rules), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding or running from punishment.
Although the line between wit and circumventing the rules is not entirely clear, I believe that this case was clearly a wit.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because there were two self-assembling and the way in which the instructions to provoke them from the management were carried out.
The damage to sporting principles by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Fight for offers to host Christmas parties in Barcelona
The calendar's dictate will concentrate an avalanche of bookings on December 16 and 17 this year.
There are a fast increase in celebrations paid for by the employees themselves, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like Turkish honey or a lottery, with the arrival of December, the pre-Christmas parties are again arriving, which still acts as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but have resulted in a battle to win clients by lowering prices: almost all of them want to spend 20 to 30 euros on food, agreeing businessmen and associations from the sector.
To complete the complication of the numbers, the calendar centered this year (when Christmas Eve fell on Friday) applications for a week from December 13, creating an avalanche of bookings for the days in peak hours (16th and 17th), while there was hardly any traffic in the previous week.
As has been the case since the lean years began in 2008, when the lean years began, are many of the companies that have cancelled the collective parties for budgetary reasons.
To keep from tradition, many employees pay their spend at parties out of their own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many are demanding prices on the edge of bearability, says the president of the association, the restaurant association Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
The patronage of the restaurant's home patronage is not daring to predict at this point what the celebrations will be like this month.
"People will think twice before making a reservation."
"They want to come out, but they are cautious when it comes to the subject of prizes," he adds.
Shots will go well for those "who offer quality and good service at a favourable price," he says, recalling that the crisis makes customers tend to go down a notch and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
A survey at various facilities shows that the biggest surge in booking requests is for the evening of December 17.
The Soteras Group is reporting a real boom in reservations this Friday, with the most requirements being on spending up to 30 euros, to which they have adapted the offered menus, with total prices ranging from 25 to 30 euros.
in another major company that is Andilana, with 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiar feature of this year's calendar has brought in more early bookings since early November.
"We have done the impossible and the impossible to keep the prices from last year, and our menus, from which everyone should choose, ranges from 19.95 to 30 euros," they report.
In the AN Grup group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 businesses, they remain optimistic after seeing a rise in profits from the second half and have a relatively solid outlook for Christmas sales.
Sources at the company stress that December 18 will also be a busy day as there will be pre-Christmas celebrations between friends.
to their six group menu, they added a Christmas menu, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they saw a tendency for guests to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine).
They also noted that companies are already appearing to invite their employees, and the size of the groups seems to be slightly larger.
The vicepresident of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bar, Restaurants and Leisure Centres in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes it is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and claiming that the number of bookings has "destoped" even though clients "to the max."
This impression did not back down even during the Christmas celebrations, to be paid by who pays, points out.
Pakistan's nuclear program spawned great unrest in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons with a "speed pace than any other country."
The Wikileaks documents confirm the taliban tacit links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the United States Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department released by Wikileaks confirms the extraordinary unrest that averages Pakistan's nuclear program in Washington.
In addition to the elucidated and significant detail they offer about the content of the communications and ideas of the representatives of North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states in terms of nuclear safety instead of increasing "it is in decline," and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state."
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but are stored after the works to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington's vigilance.
This is calculated by the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson in one report before a visit to then-national security adviser James Jones: "The mingling of some nuclear devices to the territory under the control of the Taliban, the alleged diversion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The increased number of people associated with the nuclear arsenal and the missile program is no longer only observed by the US, but also by Russia, as a spreading and presenting reason to be on the lookout.
"Pakistan has had to hire staff with a strict religious belief to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in education and culture levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry at a meeting with his US counterparts.
The biggest news of the documentation released by Julian Assange's site is the increasingly lower cooperation between the US and Pakistan on the topics of nuclear proliferation and the heightened pace of Pakistani production of these weapons.
The embassy's dispatches in May, which qualifies to communicate with Pakistan as "fruling," claims: "Transparency often does not exist; aid offers remain unanswered or are rejected."
another report notes Peter Lavoy, a South Asia national intelligence official, that "through the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as any other nation in the world."
Ambassador Petterson is also asking Washington to "great up very well" during a visit by the army's head of the army, General Ashfaq Kayani, that "the Pacian army must put an end to the tacit support of the terrorist groups."
The Hunt for the Wikileaks
Obama appoints a high-ranking worker responsible for the fight against terrorism to avoid new leaks.
Interpol issues a "red challenge" to trace and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth where it's hard to be sure of the facts.
Yesterday, Interpol announced an "extraordinary challenge," the so-called red notice, to "localize and track movement" to Assange.
However, this is not a classic detention order.
Moreover, this challenge is not new, but dates back to 20 November.
And he is dealing with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' attorney, Mark Stephens, assures the creator of Wikileaks that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
It was November 20 that when the French-based Arms Force of International Police, a French authority, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not disclose it until yesterday, when it received a permit from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have instructions to identify or locate Assange "with the aim of making a temporary detention and extradite" to him.
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of a red call, many Member States, as the organisation have explained, consider the so-called red notice to be made possible - this must be secured by a national police component - especially when the states have a bilateral extradition agreement for detainees, as in the case of Sweden and England, where Assange would appear to be.
The move scorched Assenge's attorneys, who published a writing yesterday claiming that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks had shown a willingness to answer the Swedish authorities' questions with a videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt and not a legal pursuit," the letter reads.
While the whole world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends her son's innocence - Assange is still in an unknown place, but he is silent.
on Monday, an interview was given by Skype from an unknown location to the editor-in-chief of Time magazine, demanding the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that it was responsible for ordering US diplomats to conduct espionage at the UN to violate the international conventions that the United States has signed, it should resign," he said.
His view was rejected yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who qualified the resignation demand as "spoken and absurd."
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior counter-terrorism official, Rusella Traverse, to prevent further leaks of the documents.
President Barack Obama's spokesman's intention to stop adding to Assange's importance contrasts with the views praised by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, a member of the congress to chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January, asked the State Department to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks among terrorist organisations "in order to intervene and prosecute anyone who would contribute or otherwise provide assistance to them."
Further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who said that Assange should be "killed" to be called back.
"Obama should put a reward on him or use an unmanned aircraft or something like that."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, the Baptist priest, the former governor of Arkansas and a possible presidential candidate.
"Anyone in the government, the one responsible for the leak of the information, has committed treason and any punishment other than execution would be too lenient," he said at Fox
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC by "smopping" on the Carode supporter
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret ballot to remain.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to fight the more orbits of the ERC internal revolt (Levic Republican Republican Party of Catalonia), fruitless because of the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party chairman is aware that his gesture to resignation seems insufficient to the supporters of former leader, Josep Llus, Carod-Rovira, and also knows that the sector's influence is now as weakened as its leader himself, and that he absolutely cannot be as worried as he was with other extinct currents.
That is why the leader of the Left will seek to win new reviews by fumbling to help him steean himself into the municipal elections.
First, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee would be able to covertly speak to his tenure.
Use the ballots, not to raise the hand.
If the supporters of Carodo want to hand over a penalty vote to the Speaker, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliatory measures.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid a split and subjecting himself to the person.
In several interviews, he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the vote and one extra, but added, without specifying the percentages that it would not be a good result "in the Bulgarian" way either.
Supporters of Carod are asking the chairman for more than to make his job available - which they see as a gesture that has no weight, as Puigcercós controls the largest organ at the conventions.
But with the majority not having enough of them to force resign, they will seek to recall the executive's plan from now until May.
This is why they expect to participate in the drafting of a strategy reorientation document that the leadership will give the national council vote on the national council on the 18th of the month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercós in exchange for this to promise to move the congress as early as autumn 2011.
The ERC leader said that "many vote" harms stability, and that his goal is for the organization to be able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
in this context, the article that the current adviser, Josep Huguet, signed on his blog, seems to be symptomatic of.
After taking into account Puigcercós's ideologue, this innovation advisor took the fait accompli that the leader would be confirmed by "in exchange for several goals."
And he named five of them, two of which stand out.
The first is to "overcomplige" the executive to represent at least 90% of the members, which also means including new faces who are from a sector of Carod-inclined.
The second goal can be a big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should put an end to the meeting as a working mechanism.
So he is fighting to reform the statutes in order to hold congresses through the delegates selected by the vote.
The end of the model of the meeting system, the exemption in the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction at the last two downhills.
However, the convulsive assembly of 2008 decided that the meeting must be assessed at a special congress on the reform of the statutes.
This matter is still pending as the situation within the party has discouraged the resolution of this matter.
Now, without the lurking critical sectors, it might be a good time to revisit the matter and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered for the month of November; 390 for 2010
According to MILENIO, Mexico has seen a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, according to the daily MILENIO.
Among the murders, the cases of three women stand out and the discovery of the pair of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
in the penultimate month of the year, Mexico count a total of 390 kills, probably linked to organised crime.
Among the cases, the discovery of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlan, in the district of Toluca.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, a coup d'etat to the head, and her arms and legs were bound by a rope.
The next day, a body was found in a suitcase that was stored in the vehicle's luggage compartment above Mixtecas Street, in the colony of Santa Cruz Acatlán, in Naucalpan County.
Early in the morning of Thursday, November 4, the co-cooperative discovered a body carrying signs of torture and at least three fatal missiles in the chest at the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal in the section of Villa Guerrero County.
Alongside the body was a report signed by the probably criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, a man in Nezahualcóotl was murdered with eight shots, after he left his house and wanted to start collecting garbage.
On November 7th, two victims, aged 30 in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc Collony, were killed by a shot in the head.
in Chalco, on a secluded road in El Naranjo, the corpse of a man shot to the forehead was found, and a shell cot for the 25-caliber weapon was found under the body.
in the Ecatepec were found parts of the human body in the sewage channel in the Playa Golondrina colony.
The rescue services carried out a thorough search for other parts of it, but they were not found.
Residents of the Tepototlan reported the discovery of the body with their hands tied back and their heads wrapped in the place of Peno Colorado.
The man had a shot from a firearm at the back of his head.
in the middle of the month, the murder of two men was reported who were packed in the bed underwear and left in the luggage compartment of the vehicle in the Villas de la Hacienda in the district of Atizapán de Zaragoza, and there were also reports of death threats against the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in the Los Reyes district of Los Reyes, which contained a human head.
in the nearby colony, the rest of the body was found, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorreregible.
Two dead women were found on the 17th, wrapped in bed linen in the settlement of Zoquiapan in the district of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning a man was found in Huixquilucan, wrapped in a yellow-blue sheet that was tentatively identified as Mario Ríos, according to a report left by the killers.
Ixtapaluca was found in the San Francisco settlement of Acuautla without signs of life with two blows to the back of the neck.
A tattoo of the sacred figure of Santa Muerte (literally "The Sacred Death" was discovered on the skin of the woman) and also necklaces with her likeness.
At the end of the month, a man's corpse was found in the village of Zinacantepec in the car with at least a third gunshot wounds and a report signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men were found wearing a head wrapped in tape and were also found in the village of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
For the victims, the report was probably written by one of the criminal organisations in which it said: 'This will happen to those who do not adapt'.
Two bodies were found in Ecatepec, bearing signs of torture and bound limbs, inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Centre in the San Agustín Colony.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in the districts of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóotl.
The first was beheaded and found in the colony of Cuchilla Ancón and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with tape, and had a message retained; while the second was tortured and was found in a plastic wrapper in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Together with him, the agents found a note with the message.
China adherents its goal of reducing greenhouse gases
At the UN climate change conference, a representative of the country assured COP16 that his country had made an extraordinary effort to reduce the carbon footprint, specifying that he insisted on his promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, Su Wei, the country's representative, at the UN climate change conference, assured.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had made immense efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and transform it into its industry.
He said his country has already invested $245 million over the past four years in trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
But he reiterated that China would not change its goals and would continue to work on the matter with the international community.
He reported that China's climate-change strategy was divided into the following four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution-building and support for pilot programmes.
They have already made progress on all of these points, including last year's approval of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he explained.
He also stressed that in China, federal authorities had cooperated in a coordinated manner with provincial and local authorities to achieve their goals in terms of energy saving, efficient energy use and emissions reduction.
Furthermore, as he has said, various years of plans are being run or have already been completed, which are funded by both the Chinese government and the governments of other states.
For example, it is, as it has said, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been in place over the last five years, and has received investment from the UN, the government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, a project to replace the fluorescent lamps with austerity and a mitigation and adaptation project, he clarified.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country's expert adviser on climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than common thought.
For example, he has described, greenhouse gas emissions per capita represent 6 tonnes in China, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts to use energy - for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and expects to make further progress by 2020, he added.
Encouraged by the Exclusion of Espina: César Nava
The National President of the PAN Party (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech National Action Party) - ed.
The national chairman of the PAN party, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientos had been enacted and that the former chairman of that party was entitled to turn to the National Order Commission to seek his right.
in an interview made before the objection was raised by the State governor, Gabon Cué Monteagud, he said that the exclusion of Espin was in any event a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the State Committee in Sona."
"Pan Espino has the right to turn to the National Council's Riot Commission in his case in his case to make a decision made by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that now was not the time to think about 2012, and that she had never been to the negotiating table for the alliance's presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his belief that PAN would emerge from the internal elections held on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected, strengthened.
"This (Aaliance in 20122) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not for the time being, it was the intention for local elections that was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The PAN president said that 71 years of dialogue have been behind his party and therefore "this is not being alarmed by internal competition, on the contrary, we are benefiting from it and strengthening us," he added.
He said the committee could, without question, elect the best chairman or chairwoman he deserved for the next three years, so he would hand over the baton to "whoever the committee appoints."
"I am therefore absolutely calm and relaxed, to hand over to any of the five of them with pride in the office of the party chairman."
He predicted that the rise the party had seen in the last elections in July would be reflected in future races, although "there is still no time to think for 2012."
"Now we need to accompany the governor, Gelee, Gelee Cué on this task."
in this context, he stressed that the three governments, rooted in the alliance in the Oaxace, Puebala and Sinaloe, would be a flag and would be the subject of observation across the country, as "many expectations and aspirations are embedded in them, and I am sure that Gabon will live up to these expectations."
When we asked him about the critics of President Felipe Calderón by the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech Revolutionary Institution) because of his four-year speeches that he rules, César Nava called on PRI members to think about the six-year periods of former presidents Ernest Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than the governing of Foxe and Claderón, then let them start defending them, get out of their shell," he agreed.
He argued that the head of the federal executive branch had the right to express himself as he did during his speech at the National Auditorium, as neither gag or censorship was used in that country.
Obama promotes Twitter bill in support of undocumented students
"If you think that passing the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and pledge to pass this bill," the US president tweeted on a popular social network.
President Barack Obama today, with a post on his personal Twitter account, joined the national mobilization to support the Dream Act Act, which should legalize students without documents.
"If you think that passing the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and urge them to pass this bill," Obama tweeted.
His short report draws attention to an online link to a more comprehensive document that asks the public to contact the senators immediately as the vote on this bill is imminent.
"Since the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time, to let your opinion be heard," he points out.
The report was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the passage of any law unless the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts and the government's funding were approved.
Such a blocking, which was announced by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could influence the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of a new treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation, called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman said he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a calendar for the rest of the projects could be drawn up.
"I believe there's still plenty of time to do . . ."
"We all agree that we need to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that we will be able to reach an agreement on this at some point in time and then we will be able to plan the order of other matters," he said.
Democratic Majority Leader of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "vote to close the debate" on the Dream Act, so the proposal to legalise undocumented students in the Senate could be put to the vote from next Thursday, although next week is more likely.
The Senate Approval of the Dream Act, or the "American Dream" Act, would be legalized by the roughly 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, have resided in the country for the past five years, and have been admitted to the institution of higher education or the military.
But supporters need 60 votes to pass the draft, so they need the help of several Republicans, so his adherents' organizations are conducting an intensive agitation to ensure the passage of this bill.
The Democrats, whose majority of the Dream Act support, have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, commented that he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for the law.
That's why Senators in the Dream Act need to win over a few Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom the supporters negotiate the most, Senators from Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins are among the Republican senators, as are the outgoing Florida senator, George Lemieux, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas, but they said they would not support it next time.
Another Republican who supported the bill, John Mccain, has yet to comment at this point.
Although the House of Representatives is leaning toward a different version, according to a majority of analysts, the Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the senate.
with literature they put their finger in the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "tune your finger to the wound" is the equivalent of the Czech "to strike the nail on the head).
The second round of the cycle Pleasing from the Language was a promenade where the participants performed a literary gala
"I understand that with Sex in the language, but... Finger to the wound? What is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round of Pleasing the Language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used as a subtitle on this occasion (at another trade fair, they addressed the subject of Sex in the Language, she explained).
The finger "insils us into the narrows," the Argentine-born novelist said to the audience, composed mostly of young people who gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair to hear this debate at the Tile Table, moderated by Marisol Schultz, and with the participation of Valenzuel, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Monter and Luis García Montera.
Luisa Valenzuel read a text she gave to Gonzal to Celor, which Schultz then described as a great story in which Luisa first appeared as the protagonist who, in search of the knowledge of what "hGyre" goes from doctor to doctor, from answering, though the footprints of the same story did.
From the infectolog, the convinced walks away: 'patience is not my strength, maybe it will be my blow'.
Finally, after a frustration with a traumatologist who took her breath away in the middle of the road but explained to her that the wound was not a scientific term, he was a psychoanalyst who discovers the secret: "the gate is the open, and the symbolic one is the scar."
The protagonist sighed in a lightest, concluding that "she had only learned so much about the blow that she was really outspoken and that she did not exist," but she became convinced that the pleasures and pitfalls in the language had to go hand in hand with each other.
The writer Valenzuel played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also stepped up with a delightful narrative he called Praise of Invention, in which the finger is not named in the wound, but appears at one point.
with elements of magical realism, it tells of a glorious witch who played the clouds, brought back people who had gone far, or corrected the virtue that a virgin had lost, this narrative that was then turned to make America speak, a great novel that had not been absent from the outset of his own chroniclers who told him, and is quoted here by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the exaggeration in the narrative of conquest captains.
"Cervantes, who invented us all (the writer), mocked the fake testimony that was presented in the stories as real, but in other ways it has never been possible to tell the story of America with such an ephemerality that lacked even shame."
However, he pointed out, "they are fools and liars who have a greater imagination" and just where the reality and the lie blend, where it is no longer known what the story belongs to one group and in the other, the fictional literature reaches its peak.
He calls it a truly "Cervant tradition."
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Then Mayra Monter emphasized and praised the diversity of interpretations made possible by the invitation of the International Book Fair with her Finger to the Wrings interview.
The Cuban-Pomestic writer has pointed her finger at the great blow of social violence that passes through her country - and is shared by Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs conclude a tacit compromise that is not intended, of course," she said after she said that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the compromise that is created between the author and the readers - and in their "chemical reaction."
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performances also emphasized "on this finger to the wound of a writer-bound writer."
He said that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual habits and the control of consciousness, which is brimming with dogmatisms, it is forgotten "that behind each nod there is a small no, and behind every denial there is also a small yes."
"To be the masters of our thoughts and to be the realities, we must color: and to color it means putting your finger in the wound many times and harassing those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in cartoons, in black and white, in fixed ideas and without colour, and also to harass the authorities who prefer this black-and-white world," he said, to promote the meaning of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, having experienced both the good and the bad during his career, but has already achieved a three-time series on a crucial series.
in the Santos Laguna and Monterrey duel in the final, two different styles collide marked with their techniques, teams that have a noticeable difference in results between them.
Rubén Omar Romano has played three defeats in the finals, having experienced both good and bad during his career, but has been able to reach the decisive series on three occasions, but until now he left with nothing, and that is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentine had to settle for the silver medal, remained a step behind the winners and, quaintly, playing the following final with the team.
As a coach, the Santasist strategist reached his first final in the 2002 Apertura 2002 tournament, wearing the reins of Club Morelia, with whom he fell to a 4-2 overall against Toluce; then, in the 2003 Clausura tournament, he again advanced to the decider and also lost to a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with Santos Laguna in the Torneo Bicentenario 2010 tournament, again against the "Devils" of Tolla, Rubén suffered a defeat again, although his team played against the "Deduators" (the club's other nickname Deportivo Toluca - re-runner) after 210 minutes of play, drew a tie 2-2, after a series of penalty shootings got into the advantage of three on one and had two opportunities to seal the title, but in the end his three players missed the turnover from 11 steps and the team thus suffered a turnaround to 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals against the "Red Devils" of Tola and one against Monterrey, his future rival, he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, and he could celebrate the title for the first time, though he says the most important institution for him.
"I want to come out as a winner, I don't want to break the statistics, this is for the club, for the passion I am bound to, and the title would be for me, of course, but the first one is the most important", the coach commented when he was asked about the numbers that speak against him in the final.
in living memory he has the previous final, in which, as he confirms, he has learned a lot, "we have learned a lesson that until the referee clips the end, we cannot celebrate, we have to be ready for action, as well as the players, because last time with two penalties, we were already ready to run out to celebrate, and I think we have learned this in this, we cannot celebrate until the game is over."
He is not concerned that this series could be decided by the penalty shootout, he trusts his players: "You never try to reach a series of penalty kicks, you try to finish in a normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and it is necessary to be prepared for it, we were prepared in the last tournament, but unfortunately fate has prepared for us, but unfortunately fate has prepared for us, perhaps because of the nerves or anguish we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it, that left us something in us and hopefully this time something like this will happen."
Romano has a chance in his hands to stop being the other and to taste for the first time the glory that the titles bring.
U.S. changes visa granting rules
People will have to turn to the Service for Visit Applications Center before the Consultation interview; the cost will be lower and the waiting time will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011, the visa consultation process will be changed at the United States Embassy and consulates.
with the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to contact the Services for Visit Applications Centre (accomercacked from English: ASC) before the interview at the Consulary Unit.
The staff from the ASC will remove the applicant's biometric information and they will be evaluated by the Consulatory Department before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, which are the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, no longer to be payable for the meeting to be agreed, the second for the processing of the application and others for the delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant will only pay a single fee to cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: an amount equivalent to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for cases of visas with applications (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for a visa for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to interview the consulator with the consulator, but will only contact the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
As the biometric information will be taken to ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with an interview at the Consulatory Unit will spend a shorter time here than in the past.
Likewise, those applying for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra fee for the $26.

NASA announces discovery of alien life
The U.S. Space Agency has called a press conference for tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a break in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The United States' National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, that could corrobiological confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. by experts in astrobiology, science, which studies the origin, evolution, spread and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA's headquarters in Washington.
When she invited journalists, NASA assured that it would present "the discovery that would cause a break in the search for extraterrestrial life," which aroused speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are, in addition to us, other creatures living in inhospitable conditions that were considered uninhabitable, and who might represent the possibility that they would one day become intelligent creatures such as humans, if the conditions in which they live improved.
The appearance is a microbe found at the bottom of Lake Mono in the Yosemist National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too poisonous to any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses the arsenic for its life, and it is this ability that increases its ability to make a similar life occur in other planets that do not have the atmosphere that is on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proven that "there is a different, second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will announce the real reach of the discovery at tomorrow's press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of living life on Mars; the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who explores Titan (Silton's greatest month of Saturn) with the prospect of its chemical composition being similar to Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patrón produce opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Congress Act lead to the arrival of "Bipartism," they claim.
The 60th parliamentary term was not even launched when the opposition bloc, led by the members of the PRD parties (Partido de la Revolución Democrática, Czech for "Partrana of the Democratic Revolution" - note forwards), PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech for "Prana práce" - note for the sake of the PRD parties (Czech: "Titlement" topped) and Jesús Manel Patrón Montal, who declared himself independent, and the four discussed one thing: the arrival "Bbipartism" to the House.
Before the start of the session for the opening of the 1960s parliamentary term, Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo "playing" against the reform of the Constitutional Act as it eliminated them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it begins "Bapartism" because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilarova, the PRD coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador López by the British side of the PAN (Partricido Acción, Czech "National Action Party" - ed.
Corvera Quevedo said that these reforms institutionally form a political marginality at the instigation of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech "Revolutionary Institutional Party") and PAN.
He specified that during the coming days they would speak to the representatives of the PAN and the PRI parties to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not have it, they would again be subjected to these two parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
"When I came here (opposition coalition), I look at it, because we are excluded from any decision, they don't even have a willingness to consider the opinion of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, said Convergencia that they were aligned with the PRD, PT and Patrón and therefore forming a pluralistic group.
It is impossible to allow Congress to be "duopon" after being monopoly.
The airitology of the reform of the law is not to make congressional endless bipartism.
This group begins with five lawmakers, and its members are now talking with other colleagues to win more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from the PT side, explained that at the moment Congress has become a "reminded" of two - in reference to the PAN and the PRI parties.
"It was previously controlled by only one side, now two divided by it."
Patrón asked Montalvo to respect the personality of the MP, to be given a seat at the negotiating table.
"For the five Members, of which there will probably be nine, but they see us at five right now, will not be left outside, in a different faction, for the arched agreements, to unite to find a seat at the negotiating table, as the problem is that we are standing outside the reform they have formed and agreed to, and we do not agree to this reform."
Another 200,000 pesos are being issued for the "supplier"
The town hall in Mazatlán will pay for another cheque discussed to the owner of the company supplying the electric thermal.
Another cheque for a little more than 200,000 pesos was sent to Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos by City Hall.
This brings the sum paid in this second half of the owner of the owner of the company supplying the electromaterial to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the town hall's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was sent on 16 November of this year, was issued for a sum of 200.144.56 pesos and as its subject listed "the settlement of outstanding payments."
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality will pay this contractor, who was monitored by the High State Review Office for selling at high prices, with another amount of money.
What was not said is the total amount that the town hall still owes her, and how many more checks will be sent to Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been purchased now, it is only paid for what we owe it, as well as to other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques were "released" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on days 15. October, 19. October, 29. October and this last November.
Although the entrepreneur has not yet been published in the Governmental Paper, as the law states in the case of the firms examined by the General State Review Office in order to prevent their services from being used by other administrative authorities, the treasurer assured that she had not again used the services of the City Hall's contractors.
in the previous period, after 25. July, the daily Noroeste published a review of the cheques issued by City Hall to its suppliers, which revealed that between March 2008 and 9. July 2010, during the three-year period of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the city of Camacho Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 cheques.
It also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where it collected cheques for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist jobs in urgent need of maintenance
Tourist managers complain in connection with the accident of a foreign tourist because of the poor condition of the Sánchez Taboada party in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist to the hollow at the Sánchez Taboada's gaze, the local sector in Mazatlán is asking the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition and thus do not show the port in a good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Territory Traders Association, recalled that they repeatedly asked that the impression of the destination be taken into account, and the bad things tourists find here in order to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks affected tourists who walk and see the mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to close a business for a day, and they have no idea of the sales that are leaking, otherwise they wouldn't have dealt with these matters for so long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist was caused by a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the town hall.
"The town hall will have to take responsibility and prevent something like this from happening again, it will have to devote itself to preventive maintenance, not just to correct existing defects," he said.
We would like to enjoy the clean city, as it is not only because of the fact that we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, after all, as well as residents we deserve a clean residence, the town hall should change its strategy of city maintenance."
There are other places that look neglected and pathetic, he noted, such as the mazatal Emblehem and El Venadito (monument, deer's statue).
"Nowadays, for tourists to come, it is not only the promotion that matters, it is necessary to offer a good product, a city that brims with the cleanliness of its beaches and streets where the permanent maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"The attention to this has not been paid to this here, and these facts emphasize something that is well known to all, the maintenance is lacking.
He talked about a number of places to be put in order in cooperation with the town hall, he said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, the subsecutor of the Tourist Forum, said that the rescue of the tourist sites in Mazatlán was urgent as they were not used properly and did not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural destinations and space, which will be needed first to be put in order to make these places more attractive and to be able to place them in the list we have to promote this destination'.
IP requests results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, the president of the CCE, would like MPs to take on a great responsibility by setting an example in the search for a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges facing the state.
The parliamentary term full of decent work and without agreements between the parties and the State Executive is demanding the business sector in Mazatlán, as Sinaloa is convulsing and facing major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary term, consisting of seven political forces, 19 MEPs, 13 from PAN, three by the Party of Partido Nueva Alianza, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from the Convergencia party and the last of the PVEM party, has been launched, comprising a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations of the new members of Congress is to be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same party and paternalist patrons will not be repeated.
Eduardo Dalggedos Zamora, chairman of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), proposed that the recently elected 40 members of Congress take on a great responsibility and set an example on the way for the better Sinala in the various challenges it faces.
"We expect that Members will actually exercise their right, without agreements between the parties, because they usually make measures to promote their own interests and become carnival parades for the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
That is why he talked about the need to reaffirm the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to move the ruling forward in order.
"We want them to do a dignified job and be particularly indebted to society and sectors, because it was the people of Sinaloa who gave them the confidence in the last election with their vote."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, has commented that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives will be to gather all the forces in an attempt to achieve the country's economic growth, because the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important thing is to encourage economic growth to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will encourage job creation in a certain way'.
As for tourism, he asked that the new legislators give him more weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is a ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate, given that this is an important economic activity, bringing currency and investment, which, moreover, directly competes with agriculture."
In addition, to issue funds for launching tourism projects, Congress should help deliver to the state in security and assistance with the Alcohol Act, which has failed to be resolved in previous parliamentary periods.
Searching for the Three Kings
The dolls, cars and bicycles, along with other toys, are on the children's wish list in the Coronado Valenzuel family.
Their parents will find it difficult to meet their ideas on the upcoming feast of the Three Kings, as their household is exactly 12 people and one ram.
But Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Balthazar would give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest dwelling in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor circumstances, as the father has no permanent job.
"Sometimes we have a hard time, because my husband is unlucky, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... I go out with the "plebejci" on the street to sell on the street this afternoon," said Cayetana Valenzuel Andrade, the children's mother.
Four-year-old Adelaida wants a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for ten-year-old José Alfredo, he would have wanted a car for a while, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana would like clothes in size for one year.
"He (José Alfredo) 'I'd wish this monster car', but I said 'we'll see him son' because it was very expensive," he recalls with the sadness of Cayetana.
For the older children who were in the school, the clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, is a size 12, 10-year-old Isaías size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel wears a size 8.
Jose Juan, 14, is missing sneakers, so he could use a five-and-a-half- or six-a-half-six pair.
To help make the sons of the Coronad Valenzuel children's dreams come true, you can take part in the "Searching for the Three Kings" campaign, and bring a gift or cash at the Noroeste reception.
14 suspected drug traffickers who were arrested
Ten inspections were carried out in the Asteries, Wednesday, as part of the destruction of the network for the production and sale of Indian cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and face various charges.
The tours took place in Sherbrook, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places used to manufacture drugs.
"Approximately 750 Indian cannabis beds, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment that was used for production seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the Quebec police.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, both of whom the supposed bosses of this entire network, two men from Sherbrook.
The arrested persons had to arrive at the judicial palace in Sherbrook after their arrest.
They could face charges of Indian cannabis production, possession of it in order to trade it, conspiracy and theft, among other things.
These searches were held following a long-term investigation which lasted almost a year.
"It was the information we received from the public that allowed us to proceed to these arrests," said M. Ruel.
This police operation involved 70 regional police officers in the investigation of the city of Estrie Quebec State Police, the Sherbrook State Police and the Sherbrooku Police Administration Memphrémagog.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without any problems.
The Conservative bill, which the government says should regulate the problem of ships loaded with illegal immigrants, will evidently be overwhelmed, while all three opposition parties said on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I am strongly leaning on the Charter."
"I'm standing upright on the side of the party that built the granite under your feet," said the Liberal chief, Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after the weekly session of the weekly du caucus.
The Liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, the bill, would allow the detention of up to one year for any person from a ship identified as a ship transporting illegal immigrants would infringe the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because it was aiming for the wrong goal.
"We are against it and all the opposition parties seem to be against it, so we will see what the government does," said M. Duceppe.
The NPD critic on the issue of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected critics who want her party not to be strong enough for illegal immigrants.
"Neo-Democrats agree to take measures against smugglers of illegal immigrants and that is what we consider to be the supporting part of another bill, C-35," said Ms Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it blames the refugees and puts children in prison for at least one year," Ms Chow explained.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has blamed the opposition parties.
"The Canadians are telling the parliamentarians en masse that they are not tolerating this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations, which take aim at Canada and treat it as some kind of patsis."
They expect Canada to take consistent measures, Secretary Kenney responded.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence in its bill, which could lead the country to the country's elections to be rejected.
One conservative told the QMI Agency that the government would demand a vote for any member who opposes to answer to his or her constituency.
New unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement , the possible creation of a permanent force to fight corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public inquiry into the issue.
Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, is seeking to ensure that the idea does not come into reliving: Quebec intends to consult the Department of Investigation from New York as early as January next year.
Metropole has had a permanent anti-corruption unit at its disposal since 1870.
That's why Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one of us.
It should be noted that in the meeting of the Permanent Council of Police Offices in Quebec 29. October last year, the measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil himself was also present.
More was needed for a public-security critic, PQ party member Stéphane Bergeron, to rate this announcement as "the rabbit pulled out of the hat" and "amateur solution botched on his knee."
Minister Dutil himself has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"It will be satisfied with the confirmation: you will see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of the problem."
For the president of CSQ, Réjean Parento, nothing can replace the establishment of witness interviews at a public hearing.
"Moreover, Mr. Charest is confirmed that he does not want to create this commission of inquiry, and people think, as you and I are, that he is hiding something," he explains.
"The only means to achieve the creation of a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of High Civil Officials.
In order to emerge from this impasse, he suggested to Quebec that he give special authority to the inspector general's office to investigate the collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General', he said.
He also considers that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioners who are allowed to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the Charesto government's writings.
Quebec would also be after Ottawa to change the Criminal Code to be better suited to this type of crime.
This claim would be based on the commissioner for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), who informed the Minister of Justice, Jean-Marco Fournier, that the case-law on this type of investigation was not explicit.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, was currently looking into some of the amendments associated with the dossier.
In Operation Spring 2001, which affected groups of bikers, even though the Criminal Code has not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently had amendments made to the Gangster Act.
Rivers under close scrutiny.
Several watercourses have come under strict control due to heavy rainfall that have fallen since Tuesday in several provincial regions.
On Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius, there was a landslide.
Two houses were evacuated as a precaution.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
The road is dented.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions suffered heavy rainfall, i.e. it rained from 40 to 70 millimetres.
From 20 to 40 additional millimetres was not expected from today until Thursday evening, by region.
Sections to the north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were hit hardest.
It could drop in a total of up to 100 millimetres.
If we add up these precipitation with the thrashing of the snow accumulated in some sectors, we can be feared by the floods for some watercourses.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Rescue Service issued a fire warning of the danger of flooding for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers, in Lanaudière.
Rivers to the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the forest of Laurentides, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, have been subject to flood alert and continuous inspection.
In the de Lanaudière area, heavy collisions caused the flooding of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in the Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, one makeshift bridge was torn down by heavy rains.
Two residences had to be evacuated as a precaution.
In Outaouais, the spilling of some lakes from the shores was caused by the closure of some roads, mainly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The ambulance service is on alert and oversees the situation in the area, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Centre for the Pestivals to predict the floods issued fire warnings for several rivers on Wednesday, notably Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont was partly a bind
Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback to the Canadian Radio and Television Standards Board (RRTV) for controversial social assistance statements and Haitians, as well as for rude language during the broadcast.
The Broadcasting Council considers that Mr. Dupont and his group from the CHOI, FM, had the right to express their views, but some of the statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance and the improperly negative account of the Haitians' rude language that does not correspond to the broadcast broadcast during the day."
The Council also concluded that the debate on the suicide, including the broadcasting, did not contradict the radio broadcasting regulations.
The Broadcasting Council received several complaints about the comments made during the broadcast, which were broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after a complaint by the Common Front of Social Support for Quebec's Social Support.
The group complained that the sums indicated on the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must present reliable information, not deceptive.
As for the suicide, the moderator, Stéphane Dupont, thought suicide was a gesture of despair.
The majority of the Commission members concluded that the transmitted report was such that suicide could not be seen as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"Most of the Commission considers that the disputed episodes of the broadcasting of the "Duponton Noon News" have come across a delicate subject in an impartial and appropriate manner."
There was no complaint against him.
The latest dispute concerned a statement that followed the Haiti earthquake.
So Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort embarked on a media shootout that sparked many responses.
The CHOI host said he had not sent any donation to help the Haitian, because we could not know with certainty that the needy would actually receive the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates an unduly negative picture of the Haitians.
"I've already atoned for my three-day delay on the matter."
"My file has been intact for a year and a half," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use gross expression in broadcasting.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio broadcasting cooperated "beyond its responsibilities."
The conditions, which will have to notify, inter alia, these decisions once in the course of the main broadcast within a period of three days, the consequences are minimal.
King du kung fuvà Montreal.
The Montreal resident, originally from Algiers, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely special run-off.
The athlete, who excels in the "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), enters the tatami and rings of the world in kickboxing and Thai boxing and looking for new challenges.
"I started with martial arts as kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained to Zemmal, who has lived in the capital since 2008 to study with professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for fights a little bit everywhere, because for those who don't like the game on the ground that appear in combat sports, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, this man, who works as a security guard and as a helper for UPS, has just delivered the bad news to his rivals when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championships from 23. to 30. October, Edimburg, in Scotland.
"I have won the kickboxing category of full contact and Thai boxing categories, he said."
"I am currently preparing for China for the World Cup in the san-sh."
"They were invited to the opponents who finished the first four at the last World Championships in each category."
"I won the Broncos in Toronto in 2009."
"In 2005 in Vietnam I finished eighth."
"In 2007 in China I finished in the fifth rank of the tournament, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished third , added.'
"Interestingly, I've made some progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be the first this year or next year!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline coming from China where punches and legs, as well as being thrown to the ground, are permitted.
Matches are traditionally set on the platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, from this form of struggle, is a Vietnamese-born American, Cung Le, well known in the martial arts world.
While Nacer Zemmal is to retain only one result in his career, he will boldly confirm his participation in the "King of Sanda" super-turnate, the Super Bowl in kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, the likeable fellow explains."
"It's a bit of a miracle for Stade Lumpinee (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before suffering a loss in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real pro, he analyzed."
"There are four competing categories (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)."
"The victors of the semi-finals will meet in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will meet to be crowned only champion, the king of kung fu."
450 contracted millions without public tenders
Hydro-Québec has agreed by mutual agreement of 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering to the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is the consortium created from BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which won the most important contract, a contract to manage the entire project, a total of $295 million without a public tender.
This consortium, on behalf of the Énergie gérance, was empowered in 2004 in parallel to the selection of Hydro-Québec to entrust to the private sector its responsibility for the management of this major hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
In early 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" won a lucrative contract without any announcement of a public tender.
For the Quebec side, the complaint against a consortium of businesses confronts us with a serious problem of ethical nature, risking the exclusion of competition and triggering price increases.
"It's a new way to implement the collusion and eliminate the competition."
"This means that people, they no longer make sidecards in secret, they are now open to doing them openly," PQ MP Sylvain Simard said at a press conference yesterday.
A little earlier, in the morning, M. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly because he says it is hard to see how the public interest can be sold in this way.
The Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, objected in the afternoon, in a deniquity about this contract being a colouza.
"I have my own path," she thundered, claiming that the PQ was "unrespectable" and "lad of accuracy."
She said "it would be the least of it" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for the creation of a consortium is a common practice worldwide.
It is usually an alliance, capped at a time, that allows two or a few businesses to group their mutual expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a comprehensive project.
The Eastmain project is very complex with the work's complexity in view of the skillet.
Construction is already running and must be scheduled for 2012.
However, the contract was granted without the competition being able to act; it was a deal.
It must also be admitted that the consortia's formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week by Le Devoir, a consortium of consultancy in engineering is under investigation in government.
If we fly the business register of Quebec firms at speed, this will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, with some of them appearing to be created permanently.
This is how Dessau operates in partnership with most of its main competitors; let's name CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal person, and that is Dessau.
As for the Énergie Gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau underlined in particular the fact that "the Territory of la Baie James is characterised by a special dynamics of the workforce and that Hydro-Québec has responded to it since the 1970s."
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Energy Company Baie James (SEBJ), gave an explanation to wrinkle us to the front of the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you are going to the tender and if there are few bidders to the contest, your offered prices may be higher."
"You have two options to choose from: i.e. to take away the people who are in that contract as the contestants, and that you say, "Let's make a deal of a satisfactory and good price."
"But the main idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competence of the people," Mr. Laporte confirmed.
This contract awarded to the consortium of Énergie Gérance is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000 received by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 consultancy contracts in the engineering sector, concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories performing soil samples analysis.
SNC-Lavalin scooped up 22 contracts, of which Génivar acquired from them 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without having a stake in "Éergiega of the gérance."
All contracts were concluded.
The total is $449 783 344,400, including a contract with Énergie gérance to $295,131 564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were "very good acquaintances of the Liberal Quebec Parties."
Minister Normandeau dropped the report that PQ was also linked to the firms that "fund" it was "funded" before specifying that they were its executives.
Barometer of responsible consumption - 'green' etiquette does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly sceptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little faith in the players in sustainable development, but also of "impartial" brands and environmental certificates, to follow the selection of products accordingly.
The worst of it is that even bathing in a media universe that urges us to be more socially responsible for consumption, this media universe laments the lack of credible information, the failure to fulfil obligations that it even qualifies as a brake on its commitment, Baromèètre reports responsible consumption, the first article of which was published yesterday.
Even though consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, the Quebec residents who are trying to sell them, they still don't trust them too much
In fact, two-thirds of us say that they don't believe the environmental promises of companies simply because the green advertising of companies is identifying a measuring tool developed by the Sherbrooke University's Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Other findings: half of consumers doubt the credibility of the official certificates, given to the so-called just products, but also the credibility of the products and brands, which are described as ecologically responsible, Barometre says.
In the same way, the debate of politicians on the subject is accepted as a serious mere 14.6% of Quebec's population.
However, information on responsible consumption appears to be paramount to stimulate this consumption site, revived at the moment by almost a third of Quebec's consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the questionable nature of the information would soften the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by Baromètre, after the higher price of these products.
After all, a third of Quebec's population is incredulously opposed to the reported data about the products or the "green" services we seek to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, to change the brand name of one or more, thus responding to their beliefs.
A full 61% of them favored purchases from traders from their neighborhood and preferred to buy food grown in their region, says Baromètre.
More "green" and responsible - the responsible consumption index reached 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - Homo consumus Queeek likes to present itself as the king of recycling, which seeks the least impact on the environment by caring for animal protection.
But their social and environmental conscience was clearly left somewhere outside their car, Baromètre says: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebec residents said they were using public transport or that they recommended the use of a car to travel for at least two people, in the interest of conservation.
Walking and the bike were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioural survey who used this cliché.
A loan to the state to buy the cinema complex eXcentris
The Quebec government, which we asked for a financial participation in the purchase of the cinema complex by eXcentris by the Angus et le parallèle, agrees to participate, but only up to the amount of the loan.
Developer company "Angus et le Parallèle," which sought a $7 million donation from the Minister of Culture to buy the cinematographic complex on Saint-Laurent's tabloid, and which demonstrated its mission as a film-maker, has not won what it demanded.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the dossier, but on its own terms.
Rather than expected, the government of Quebec proposes a loan, the amount of which would be lower, some of which were the original expectations, which could set the basis for a viable solution on advantageous terms and resources from the state.
The first action plan and the request for 12.8 million were already rejected by Quebek by Quebek last spring, but applications have already been revised to cut.
The proposal and plan for the work were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the president of the Society for the Development of Business in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who directs the eXcentris cinematographic project.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counterpropos came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have until December 31 to respond.
However, it seems that the state's gift-great-great-great-great-great-nessed hypothesis.
Recall that the Association of Cinema Owners and Cinematographic Centres in Quebec was opposed to the state's direct investment to support the purchase of the eXcentris, judging that the Minister of Culture should not finance a real estate project when he did not do so for other theatres.
But several participants in the discussion, on the other hand, demanded substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, was given to his cinema space during his ten years of film art after he himself financed the construction of the complex, which may have been the reason for amending the state's financial council.
The shortage of the halls for independent films is gairdled in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to win over a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini at its head, is running a campaign to release funds to the private sector, in the belief that it will gross $700,000 to push through the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, the only one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The aim of future acquirers is to reopen all three halls on 27. February next year and screen Xavier's most beautiful film, Beauvois Men and the Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't like Le Devoir and so he ignores himself, so he and his group think of the shrinkage proposals made to him.
The raised curtain on Canada as a whole...
America's new diplomatic sources made known through WikiLeaks reveal what the United States sees as a complex of inferiority of Canadians against Americans, but by the same blow, betraying their sense of superiority to Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that it is up to each Canadian-American electorate to vote for, and believes that President Obama's visit to President Obama helped the Conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
Four new reports, which were the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, unveiled to the public yesterday, provide sensitive details to get 'under each other's skin'.
The Communication, dated September 22, 2008, in the midst of the election campaign, sets out in detail at what point the United States is not part of the betting debated by political leaders.
Much to the surprise of the American ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides some explanations for this situation.
"The Canadian inferiority complex, almost obscured, makes perhaps political leaders conditional on talking about internal betting, rather than realizing that this election also applies to the United States (as in the free trade campaign of 1988)," he writes.
"The United States is therefore," he concluded, "a convert elephant in this election:the nationalist, but potentially too threatening to be talked about."
The ambassador understands this "enignal silence" all the less that both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of a candidate, party or, better still, the head of the party to manage these important relationships should be a key factor in the electorate's mind when they go to the polls."
We can read another statement of this sense of importance in a report sent by Terry Breese, chargé d'Affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure that the government is maintained in a confidence vote in early February, regarding the federal budget by which Canada publicly reaches its first deficit in more than a decade, due to a $30 to $40 billion recovery plan," writes M. Breese.
There was no mention of the government's need to adjourn the pre-Christmas session of parliament so that it could not be defeated by the coalition, and that the opposition parties make their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report and signed by Ambassador Wilkins points out Washington's increasingly negative image that is being hailed by the United States' dramatic series broadcast on CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcasts of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which not too subtle references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also to kidnappings for the purpose of human raids at the CIA.
Another report reports that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner, Bernardo Kouchner, if Europe was ready to receive some of the Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner replied yes, but on the "case-and-case case" principle.
At the end of the meeting, it says here, "he forwarded some paper to the State Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian descent."
"The secretary accepted the secretary, saying she would revise the file."
Let's note finally that the people involved in WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on the CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "destroyed."
It broke up, and Mike Huckabee heard about it in the United States.
World Plan to restore lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed a plan in Cancún to restore home lighting, store and industrial space lighting in 100 countries to achieve a reduction in the greenhouse effect (GES), which corresponds to almost one third of the other constraint to stabilise the planet's climate from now to 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of the large concrete projects that the UN wants to push through in Cancún to compensate for the absence of difficult-to-reach reduction commitments on the part of industrialised advanced countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent incandescent flinches, which monopolize the market still monolpolize, are replaced with fluo-compromising or, better, with light bulbs with electroluminium-cented diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), a substantial amount of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) GES emissions on the planet due to lighting would be dismantled.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions.
It's the equivalent of 70% of emissions from a car park across the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, major countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, among them Canada, joined in voluntary reduction plans to allow GES' global emissions to fall from the 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to deduct from this balance of the 5 Gt to achieve a stabilisation of the heating of the climate to 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 so that it can be excluded that it will not be out of control.
In incandescent incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the remainder, i.e. 5%, the product of light.
With fluco-compact bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new bulbs with DEL, we will reduce this consumption twice more.
Fluocompact bulbs last averages from 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new DEL light bulbs, the kind he put into production this week - the company reportedly participated in the UN study - have a projected life of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a red-hot light bulb, giving us an idea of a possible saving save plan for the replacement that would be applied in 100 countries.
All of these new bulbs can also work with the reactat and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluo-compromacus light bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be sorted as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, and manufacturers would set up collectors.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluoccuphetti-extract bulb, but rather thermal coal-fired power plants that emit many mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these headquarters put 25,000 tons of mercury into circulation annually.
The report also sets out in detail the profits that each country would make from this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would thus save $1 billion a year for buying electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants, costing $2.5 billion to build
Côte d'Ivoire is eagerly awaiting the results of the election results.
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, requested the immediate publication of the results of the I.S. Crown Republic of the Presidential Election after the deadlines set expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for an independent electoral commission to complete its work and to immediately announce the preliminary results, the spokesman for the President of the United Nations stressed."
"It asks all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and the institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressures exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission let the electoral commission pass the last date - Wednesday's midnight - without releasing the results, three days after Sunday's scandilde.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI confirmed on television that the commission "continues to work" in order to declare the results.
On Wednesday, calls for CEI to finally announce the name of the second-round winner, between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassan Ouattara, a member of the opposition, have already multiplied.
But Camp Gbagbo relies on the annulment of the Constitutional Council for the "fraudulent" vote in the north, administered by the former New Army (FN) rebels since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the Côte d'Ivoire's presidential election campaign, confirmed that voter intimidation's maneuvers practiced by the FN (New Army) in the north of the country have deterred supporters of the Ivorian President of the Ivorian President.
The election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council had taken into account the complaints lodged by Gbagbo.
But opponents of President Gbagbo believe that the country's supreme court is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who debunked any connection to the former rebels, condemned the delay in the results' announcement as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagba to respect them, but not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the release of the results because he knows he has suffered a loss and that he has filed a complaint with the Constitutional Council after he has prevented the election commission from broadcasting the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, underway on Sunday, was seen as a coronation of the reunification and reconciliation process of a country that has been divided into two-half for years.
The United Nations warned on Wednesday of the Ivorian political faction that it could be held responsible for any potential violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, 31. October, as the winner with 38% of the vote, up from the 32% for Alassan Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Badié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France, according to the International Labour Office (BIT), remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), as shown by makeshift data with a correction of seasonal deviations (CVS) published on Thursday by INSEE.
The number of unemployed people stabilised at 2.631 million in the metropolis.
The second-quarter data was confirmed to 9.3% of the active metropolitan population and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate is increasing by 0.1 points.
In a wider scope, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but would like to work, regardless of whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, and regardless of whether they are looking for work.
The situation of the current young people on the labour market has escalated with a new rise in the unemployment rate reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, 637 000 young people aged between 15 and 24 were unemployed.
As for the elderly, they saw a slight increase in unemployment in Metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as in a year), that is, 482,000 people from the age of 50 upwards and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the population aged 25-49 saw benefits from unemployment stability to 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0,1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% across France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy about its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, is continuing to produce monthly statistics and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after it was 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and placed in custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the bosses of the waste treatment companies and the brother of the PS of the Administration's Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, was charged and imprisoned at the prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of an investigation into public procurement, supposedly underhanded.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with misusing the company's assets, misuse of public funds and public property, concealing, bribes, accepting bribes to influence the office and possession of ammunition, his lawyer says.
"Alexandre Guérini is belligerent and insists that he and the judge explain all the questions this one intends to ask him, rather than any delusions."
"It is easy to pursue him for many reprehensible reasons, but it is another matter to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before questioning her client.
Mr Guérini said through his attorneys that he had sent a short message to the judge before his interrogation to explain.
One of his loved ones, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but ensure the operation of the landfills he was supposed to manage.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of the funds associated with their operation, he was never aware of any of this, Mr Simon said.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, the former CEO of the services of the Aubagne conglomerate, was charged on Wednesday for misusing public funds and the plot, and allowed the protagonists of the matter to be free, under judicial supervision, with the prohibition on seeing each other.
"My client was able to give explanations to all the facts he was accused of."
"The investigating judge takes this into account and will leave him free," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, saying they were under judicial supervision for two of them, said prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General with the elegance of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MMM), is being prosecuted for accepting bribes to influence the Office and for passive corruption."
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for "alienation and misuse of the company's assets," the other for "a flier in the misuse of public funds."
Finally, business associate Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with "calling the misuse of the company's assets."
Among those confronted with Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girde, who was recently charged in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts.
Investigators suspect his company of aiding aided to launder money from a large-scale gangster.
The investigation is conducted in the framework of several open court investigations against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the conclusion of public procurement, in particular on the matter of waste.
From a source close to the investigation, the search focuses in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects trash from Aubagne, as well as from some towns in the Marseille (MPM) municipal community.
The Case of the Clotilde Reiss: The Élya Palace exaggerated the Medirie Medirie
Over the course of more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Klotilda Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for "shpionage," unifying views in France, has taken diplomacy to combat alertness and emphasizes relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this closely watched by diplomats from the United States.
American documents, received by WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde, reveal some of the drawbacks of this crisis.
They describe how the Élysée Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how leading French officials have tried to convince Washington that the young Frenchwoman's release was not a compensation for the release of Majid Kakavanda, an Iranian imprisoned in France and wanted by the US judiciary for smuggling material in favor of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they are subjecting the sharp light to the way the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Klotilda Reiss.
He didn't really do anything.
The diplomatic telegram, written in Paris on 12 August 2009, has the headline: 'Iran:French comments on how to resolve in the case of hostages'.
An adviser at the Élysée Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa, Patrice Paoli, speaks with the representative of American diplomacy, Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They recommend the Americans to do the same amount to be brought back to the country by their own nationals of the violence-refession in Iran.
"Do the noise," they say, "still emphatically utterly "in the media the words "the basic rights of man," "innocence," "an unavailable deliverance."
It is necessary to bring to the distress of the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it the more they ask you to stop."
As there have been attempts to negotiate through discreet channels, "it will not solve the silence," the Iranians are "abrection masters of evasive manoeuvres."
Mr. Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is "auroan family tactic: taking hostages for the purposes of "political blackmail."
It announces that the liberation of Klotilda Reiss (which will occur on 16 August, on the day the French embassy will give her a refuge) "it will require a large sum of money for the Iranians" (a €230,000 caucus).
And he will announce that the Élysée Palace is anticipating the cases of the hostage, a phenomenon that "will escalate."
Iranians "could arrest another 1,800 or so French living in Iran in the future," he says.
28 August 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but still remains blocked in Iran.
The information is being circulated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, who the United States claims to have been expelled for illegal e-tech trafficking in respect of Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a judge's decision.
The US embassy, as many observers, has been questioning this disturbing consensus.
For Washington, which is persecuting Iran's illegal networks to extract material destined for the nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France agree to bargaining?
The liberation of the Iranian to free a young Frenchwoman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Élysée Palace, as he states, was not only "scared by this judge's decision" but was looking for a way to oppose it.
"There have been conversations between the presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the court's decision," he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under the "limited" supervision of the French intelligence service.
An adviser to the Élysée Palace is dialing a phone number, hangs up on the phone, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the Paris buildings run by the Iranian Embassy."
At the time of Klotilda Reiss's imprisonment in Iran, the Elysee Palace is making efforts, negotiating, through a communiqué and organized "leaks" to the media to convince him that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad is playing a "significant" and "influential" role as a "mediator."
Americans observe this activity, not without irony, stating that the manipulation is bearing fruit, as several press articles reflect the French official version.
Telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes the media "blest" of French official officials."
What is the basis of such a degree of "earminess" expressed in relation to M. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their statements full of egalomaniacs, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then looks at the reasons that forced the Élysée Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intense communication "spoil to validate President Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyses.
The policy, implemented in 2008, "was observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and described as premature and undeserved."
By "overreasing the Syrian role," Paris is trying to "demonstrate Syria, what a shycomer can come up with when it plays a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to 'simpose the grain of discord between Syria and Iran'.
The American Embassy knows this from a very good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided in him: "of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is"
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least bring confusion and confusion among the Iranians."
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it at the Élysée Palace.
In the communiqué, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role to play in favour of the liberation of our compatriot."
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Pecivální" that will prohibit adolescents from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, governmental officials in the affiliated said.
The bill will be presented to Parliament in December to ask companies operating online games to block access to these games after midnight to persons under the age of 16, officials from the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have learning difficulties at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the lead official at the ministry in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be newly available from 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he clarified.
The government also assumes that it will ask companies to limit the daily subsistence time to these young people's games, whose parents so request, the worker in charge added.
It will also make free programmes available to people who request it, to limit the time spent on the internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most "affected" and the daily newspapers regularly bring different facts linked to the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also an undeniable champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, in the face of 58 other nations.
World Championships 2018-2022: Fifa establishes host countries.
The full unrest on suspicion of corruption is being established by the Fifa Executive Committee on Thursday by the host World Cup countries in the 2018 and 2022, a selection of supremely politically motivated, where the fight for influence and lobbying risking the upright technical criteria.
The matter is certain, the Fifa Royal Competition in 2018 will be held in Europe , the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 Championships will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010 or to continue setting up to the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities to be attended by delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leading government officials in Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the opportunity to create an idea of the scale of economic and political betting around the world.
Negotiations behind the scenes face the risk of last minute lasting.
It is difficult for the rest to establish the hierarchy by candidate.
According to the evaluation report Fifa's documentation, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and the American (2022) contain the best arguments, as do the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not carry too much weight for the 22 members of the executive board at the hour for voting.
The Sunday Times at the start of the revelation, leading to the suspension of the two CE/European Commission members?/ for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu), may have ruined the chances of its country, the cradles of the hilt that have hosted the world championship only once, in the year.
The BBC put the crown on Monday when it aired a documentary that "bugged a pin" by three influential CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fifa dissatisfied and to bring into trouble the English leading official with David Cameron in the first place.
The Prime Minister is hoping to repeat the move made by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who managed to win the London Games in 2012 for the organisation of the 2012 Summer Games.
Will this intense activity be enough for England to give new shine to its name with the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, as the pair of Spain-Portugal are not lagging the trumpards of already prepared stadiums, his showcases (World Championship in 1982 in Spain, the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games, the Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their footballing culture.
But the gloomy economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Any retaliation against the English and doubts about the payability of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadions, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided not to move the Championship to Curich and publicly declared "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in verbal references only fumble twisted at accusing the English press against CE (European Commission) members.
"We'll throw mud at them, try to compromise them," said Mr. Poutin.
For 2022, the United States appears to be the logical favorite, with its considerable experience in 1994.
The world's highest performance of the economy, the headquarters of the main sponsors of Fifa, seems to be well ahead of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have produced a beautiful project.
But these candidacies seem premature for the two countries, which together underwent a "test" in 2002.
Another threat: the award of the 2026 World Cup to China, which is buoyantly desired by Fifa, made the Asian's chances for 2022 invalid.
With Qatar, which has pulled a large ace out of its sleeve in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand into new landscapes, but these two countries pose more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pay for the flimsy TV fees (due to the time shift) paid for by European countries, creating the momentum for Fifa.
Second mandate: obvious (certainty)
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand gave the appearance of hesitation.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they are.
The mandate of the Élysée Palace calls up someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not in good agreement with the share of the secret of the presidency.
So it is necessary to act as if doubts are constantly persistent.
In one and the other.
In 2006, if this would be worth believing, Jacques Chirac's friends made claims to keep the third mandate out of the question.
On November 15, with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that "it will be decided sometime in the fall of 2011."
As he recalls before members of the UMP Parliament on Wednesday evening at the Élya Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" has sowed a low-fries.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The president merely recalled that the amendment to the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It was just a statement on his part, not a notice.
This is not the first time he has resembled such meetings in the humorous tone of the presidential election.
"In the worst case, or at best, you still have seven and a half years ahead with me," he said in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next stage."
His statements the day before yesterday will not be made by a candidate more than the previous day; he will not be made by the candidate or less.
If they call out comments, it's because of the two truth.
Accelerating the path to the run for the PA, on the one hand.
But that's not the entrance to the Ségolèn Royal arena, pushing Nicolas Sarkozy to convict himself.
It is, on the contrary, because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PA want to be set up for the battle-mates rather than intended.
Poor poll on the other side.
First, the right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy over Nicolas Sarkozy's candidacy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing this matter with the UMP ", people from the immediate and circumspectia of the Prime Minister responded.
"If he believes a possible defeat, he will not run," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will still believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, copiated with the obvious.
Euro: The Central European Bank is forced to continue its purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Central Governing Council of the Year was to be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for bringing the stage out of the crisis, or, at least, the announcement of the cessation of the large number of unusual monetary policy operations that must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of sovereign European claims is committed, the Securities Issued Institute will no doubt not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of a deterioration of the situation today already strained on European securities markets.
The political price in that case would be even higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the Central European Bank in favour of addressing the debt crisis of European states.
She would not say whether she thought the bank could have done more, for example by increasing their program to buy up the sovereign bond purchase program.
"I will make my reflection for my European partners (...) "'
The night before, in Brussels, in his interview with the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Commission, the President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear to be more articulate in terms of his intentions and content to say that he said that the programme of buying state titles on the secondary market was "contingwith" and that we would "see how we will make the decision" during the meeting this Thursday.
The only certainty: The Central European Bank will be watching for its basic unchanging interest rate at 1%, its historically low level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchases of treasury bonds by the Central European Bank have doubled to almost €1.35 billion in the last week.
And thanks to the unreasonableness of the market agreements, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
Overall, the eurosystem's central banks have purchased €67 billion since May 2010.
Among the market's agreements, the anticipation of the continuation of purchases is not in any doubt (see page 29).
Nor do economists expect any significant change in the exchange rate.
If loan operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the Central European Bank's arsenal, the latter is the latter to access the unlimited provision of liquid funds under generous terms and for a period of between one week and three months.
Economists expect the mechanism to be extended by several months today.
"I can't imagine changing her schedule in a significant way."
"If not, it would mean accepting the risk of creating short-term new tensions," says Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"The progressive outlet announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," anticipates Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
On the plan of its interventions in the public debt market, "should the European Central Bank have to maintain the purchase volume of its bonds to revive the dull market," adds Norbert Bräms.
In view of the exposures of European banks in the sovereign debt markets in the euro area, there is no longer any choice but to maintain their presence in the market.
"It needs to replace the shortage of investors in the market at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent the outburst of paid performance from being among the fragile," the major bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates take off, states will be all the more troubled to reduce their debt rather than stabilize it.
It's saving the euro at this price.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government buckles his back
After the start of the week, the worrying situation for Italy relaxed a bit, with the return flow of the bond interest rate for 10 years yesterday.
A return to temporary peace.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economics, the region's presidents said they had heard Giulio Tremonti classifying the situation as "inregheliable" and that he expected an "unpredictable" weekend, which he then debunked.
In any event, on Tuesday, the deviation from the long German interest rates reached a record of 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy contracts (CDS) to cover the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) soared up to 263 points, which caused some upset in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the derogation with German interest was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "too busy" with the "murdish development of the markets" and a possible outbreak of the Irish.
"The good news is that Italy, the eurozone's third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and uncorrupted, its problem is the absence of growth and lacklustre fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and puts the state at risk of not being able to cover up its funding needs.
Brussels' latest forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the Senate's budget to analyse it is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission is calculating, the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of gross domestic product next year (against 3.9% projected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour of a new summary of the state budget proposal, which could be introduced after the holidays, of €7bn.
"If necessary, new strict measures will have to be taken," says the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy is accepting the support of international institutions.
"The cornerstones of her economy are fine and her calculations are correct, we have been saying this for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the Governing Board of the International Monetary Fund under pressure from Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, either short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product of 2011, NDLR), the effort to stabilise the required in Italy is less than the effort required of other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OCDE.
What remains is a question of political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, and then the elections to be expected at the end of March could begin to be organised after that.
This would trigger a period of time, not suitable for a decision in a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening the anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde reiterated this yesterday at a press conference in Paris: 'I think Europeans demonstrated this on Sunday throughout the day and the night, they are evidently very committed to defending their currency and their currency zone.'
Although it is all relative, yesterday's recorded expansion, concerning interest rates on European national bonds, brought water to the mill to the governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the start of normalisation.
The Standard & Poor's Notation Office has announced that it could downgrade the record of Portugal's debt, the targets on which various speculations focus most.
"Because in May there is a real insufficiently transparent and obvious policy, mainly based on banking systems," says Exane BNP Paribas economists.
All the more so because "political time runs slower than the market time."
Aware of this broken context and the dangers it is hiding, are stepped up by European countries of debate, to strengthen the already existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers, the most affected by the problem, and on a wider scale with their G20 counterparts, are progressing very well.
This is with regard to the Eurogroup meetings (Eurogroupe) and the Ecofin Group from the start of next week.
The Central European Bank meeting takes place today.
The programme includes the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries with a focus on markets (see above).
As for the European Finance Fund (FESF), its Chief Executive Officer, Klaus Regling, bailed out in Singapore's tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors from the Far East of the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of this trip is not to increase funds, it is certainly preparing the ground to achieve this goal.
The first issue of securities to the FESF is expected for next month.
Yesterday, US officials told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in the mobilised funds with additional direct involvement in the FMI.
The countries at issue in the first place, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that join the strict measures with quick effect.
Lisbon and Madrid a different path than those used by Greece and Ireland.
The two countries want to avoid at all costs asking for international aid before applying their own budgetary correcements and deciding on the structural reforms necessary to regain their continued confidence.
The European funds' equity entrants are finally talking about options available to speed up the normalisation process for the sovereignty bond markets.
On his trip to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came up with the idea of whether the €750 billion of euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund would not hesitate to rejoin the stock of securities.
Economists at Barclays Capital, an actor in the very first trade plan with European sovereign claims, reckless with the addition of around €100 billion would be enough, "better" in the form of a direct provision of financial liquidity.
The means there is: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, subsidised by EUR 60 billion to date.
The Council, which has all the chances to be tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions deteriorated.
Snow and ice: 24 counties have an orange alert.
Snow rations are still causing difficulties in transport, particularly on the second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk of disrupting some economic activities.
Twenty-four districts are now in orange on the risk of snow and ice.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, forest Deux-Sèvres a la Vienne, joined the 20 districts that already have a declared orange emergency, 18 as early as Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France, the considerable flurries of snow are causing problems in the north of la Gironde and les Charentes and light snow on Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, from 7 to 10 cm in places, is expected in the districts concerned and a blanket of 1 to 3 cm, in places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions are affected.
The flurries of snow are large enough to cause transport difficulties and disrupt some economic activities, predicts Météo France.
On the coast of the Côtes d'Armor, some districts have banned the passage of heavy freight - trucks over 7.5 tonnes with the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac route.
Road traffic on the roads of the second tier in Brittany is, according to the officers, and police recommend driving out with their vehicle only when it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been cancelled for this day.
In Pikardia, school services were banned for Thursday.
No special measures are foreseen for restrictions on freight transport on Wednesday evening.
The district office "calls on all car drivers to be as careful as possible on the roads and to adapt the driving of the nature of the road."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris's Roissy Airport on Thursday and 10% to the Orly due to expected snowfalls.
DGAC recommends passengers using air transport services to contact their company.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport in the south of London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday's shot.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the debate on modernising traffic at Ile-de-France is in full swing, billions have been raining.
At least during the discussion.
We are particularly reminiscent of the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro, to be built by Société du Grand Paris.
To allow this construction to be launched, the state announced a subsidy of €4 billion.
In theory, this is the amount that will then allow SGP to use part of the financing from its dual source for contracts.
Today we finally come to the first additions.
The 2010 Reinforcention Finance Act, which is being examined by the National Assembly's Finance Committee this morning, contains the mechanisms provided for to secure these funds.
There are two: creating a special equipment tax and raising the tax on the offices at Ile-de-France.
The first, we will read in the text of the bill, Article 15, reads "in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris."
It is quantified: 'The proceeds from this interest are 117 million euros per year'.
The second is the reconstruction of the office rate, which already exists "to be upgraded, in order to increase the yield from it and to affect Société du Grand Paris" to the increase.
How much would it take?
The ploughing.
This is not quantified in the text.
We're up to 4 billion a long way.
"It is specified that these fiscal resources are joining the 4 billion euros of the capital injection, which will be mobilised by the state and put into Société du Grand Paris according to the project," we can read in an explanation of the reasons.
To us at SGP, this system does not seem shocking.
"Since we created the income (both taxes, ndlre), we can cover up the studies for three years and then dig into 4 billion, it's explained."
"This will be budgeted and applied as needed'.
SGP considers that 4 billion will be credited in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the promised billions of billions belong to even absent subscribers, risks provoking a rather busy parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on 7 December.
Avenging hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double meaning.
On the one hand, an overt scandal is exposed, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy governing relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at international level, and anticipates the future dominated by the regression.
But let's do it first.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, this is confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by the Secret Service (any nation) consists entirely of press chats.
The "extraordinary revelation" of Americans about Berlusconi's way of sex life is reported by what everyone has been able to read for months in any newspaper (all owned by Berlusconi in addition to these two), and the infamously carto-the-caricature profile of Kadhafi has long been the subject of sketchy for cabaret performers.
The rule, according to which secret documents are only allowed to consist of reports already known, is essential in the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
When you go to the bookstore, which is dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that each work is repeated (on Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, Templars or Masons) exactly what was already written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of the occult texts does not like to search for new information (he doesn't even know where to find news about non-existent ones), but because those who devote to the occult believe only what they already know and what they confirm what they have previously learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same goes for classified documents.
The informant is lazy, and the lazy (or limited spirit) head of the secret services (and, if he is not, could, I know, be the editor of the newspaper Libération), who considers only what he admits to be true.
The high-secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy sent to the State Department was the same one that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why was there so much fuss about these documents around the revelation?
On the one hand, they say what any cultured person already knows, namely that the embassy, at least since the end of World War II and since the heads of state can make calls or fly by plane for a joint dinner, they have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small nationalization exercises have been transformed into spy centers.
Any viewer watching the films about the investigation is very well aware that it is seemingly ignored out of hypocrisy alone.
However, the fact that this is repeated publicly is vilted by the duty of hypocrisy and casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most highly classified information of the world's most powerful country is a harsh blow, not a negligible, for the prestige of this state department.
The scandal affects both the victim and its "executor."
But let's move from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once, in the days of Orwell, all the power could be taken, like a Big Brother who controlled every move of his people.
Orvell's prophecy has been proven since the ability to check each movement through the phone, every transaction you've done, the hotel's visited hotel, the highway used, and so on, has become a complete victim of a wreath of power.
But when we demonstrate how it goes now, that even the "morkups" with the most secret information of the powerful cannot resist the intervention of a hacker, the inspection report ceases to be a one-way and becomes a circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker - elected as a citizen's avenues - may know all the secrets of power.
How can a power be held that no longer has the ability to preserve its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a mysterious, unrelenting secret because it is drawn from public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secret was unforgiving secrets is to take away all his power.
WikiLeaks made no mistake with Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this blow of the established power so significant?
It is clear that in the future, states will not be able to send online sensitive information - that would be tinged to its publication on a poster plastered on the street corner.
But it's also abundantly clear that with current technology, it's pointless to hope that it's possible to keep the news averted by phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of state was travelling by plane and contacting one of his colleagues.
How will private and sensitive messages be kept secret in the future?
I know very well that for the moment my prognosis belongs to science-fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials transporting the formalities discreetly to fill the formalities on uncontrollable routes and carry only those messages that they know by heart or rather hide precious information in the heels of a shoe.
The information will be preserved in unique copies in drawers sealed with key: all in all, the attempt at espionage in the Watergate scandal was less successful than the WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is now moving sideways forward, that is, backwards.
One century after a wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet rehabilitated a telegraph based on wiretarks (telephonic).
Video cassettes (analog) allowed cinema lovers to capture the film step by step, move it forward and backward and unveil all the secrets of the assembly,while now the CDs (number) only allow to jump in chapters, that is to say, after the macroprobes.
We arrive from Rome to Milan in three hours via high-speed trains, while we arrive from an air and transport journey that includes three and a half hours.
So it is not extraordinary that politics and communication techniques will return to horse-drawn cars.
Last note.
At other times, the press tried to understand what had been consecrated in the embassy's secret.
Now it is the embassies that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France hacked its funding promises
A year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to test up to commitments to make promises for fast-blocked funding (fast start-up) or prematurely) implemented by developed countries.
And the big French hacks were revealed
In the Copenhagen Accord, the developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union has promised €7.2 billion for three years and France €1.26 billion (that is, €420 million a year).
At the launch of COP16, the EU drew a large ace to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start funding: a report specifying the action of its member states, the press conference, the grand side event, the distribution of the brochures...
A transparent operation invaluable and appreciated on its true value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to be done in the same way and with equal degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that it made €2.2 billion available in 2010, leading to the right path to upholding its promise of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on the detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
These funds are "new and additional" under the Copenhagen Accord to ensure that the increased burden is implemented without the detriment of Public aid for development.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and an additional" means.
While the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
The European Commission, for example, considered 2009 to be a reference: international funding has been preserved, and it adds 150 million to it for the three-year fast start funding title.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment terms or terms at the level of public aid for development.
By contrast, France considers that the financing of 'all new projects' of 2010 is 'new and additional'.
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or the global level of Public Aid for the Development of d'Aide publique au développement.
In particular, the total amount of support for France towards developing countries may remain constant (or even reduced), to honour its commitment to "new and additional funding...
Another crucial element is the distribution of donations and loans.
There is no rule yet, and each chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as. France, considering that 1€ borrowed is equal to 1€ for the donated.
It is clearly hard to prove to be: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be supported for some of the investments that are profitable (often the projects associated with reducing emissions, consisting of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we receive as the equivalent of one euro that we give... , we should not understand it as part of our obligations, but as a loan price for the creditor country (i.e. the interest rate equivalent).
But France can only make such a justification: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros, of which 91.5% is the loan (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (€36.1 million) - see the EU document to be able to verify this for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses a loan on such a scale.
Germany has requested 46% of this place, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) abide by their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union gives €1 to its promise in satisfaction, France will only give 10 centims and consider this effort to be comparable.
Beautiful juggling piece!
To summarise, in its financing of the "fast start" France operates with a double cheat: on the one hand, the development of the share in time and, on the other, with a real financial burden.
Although it spends only €36.1 million, it can convince that it spends €420 million "new and additional" in connection with his promises.
The Finance Minister's handling (because it seems that although it is Bercy who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would the Member States continue to donate if they just have to lend?) and in negotiations, because developing countries are not entirely naive...
The early financing chapter is just a small question mark, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could be a grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not the case for us.
Whatever it is, it is essential to draw on the lessons of this first year of early funding.
France should first announce a change in its way of keeping the accounting records for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and decency and justice to other European Union countries.
But above all, France should avoid a debate on deposits in long-term funding (another major chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the issue of 'additionality' or how to book loans.
France should change its position to become as progressive for these deposits as in others.
Hope is therefore being put in the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciuko-Morizet, who will come to Cancun next week.
France's surprise fast-track announcement and its vision for "additional" and the use of loans could trigger an increase in the level of international confidence, necessary to move forward in discussions.

The 10-year-old will be immortally ingested in one day by 81 different chemicals, according to one study published this Wednesday, by the Future Generations Association (ex-Men for Rights and Preservation of Future Generations).
The Association, which points out that its results "do not have a significant statistical value with regard to the low number of samples analysed but are characteristic of the processed issue," bought between July and September of foods commonly consumed in four meals and one light meal as a light snack per child of roughly 10 years in supermarkets in l'Oise and Paris.
These typical dishes, including official recommendations - five fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as confectionery,they were analysed by research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other polluting agents.
The plate's balance is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are listed as carcinogenic, possible or likely, and five substances are among the clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptive to internal excrement glands (PEs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Centre for Cancer Research.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical admitted individually are not exceeded, in our research we can well see that the reality in exposing consumers to contaminating substances, perhaps carcinogenic, and/or PE is striking," the association says.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain about ten résidu, with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven to be certain carcinogens, as is the case with about 20 residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, reported by the study as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a banned fungicidal agent in France.
The same goes for the green beans of Kenya, included in lunch, where the studios have discovered traces of the powerful insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, minced meat steak, tuna in a can and even buns and chewing gum were riddled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water from the tap, the analysis revealed the presence of nitrate and chloroform.
The salmon's steak for dinner was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues discovered, and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave did not avoid analysis.
The final risk to the consumer of this "cocktail of contaminants" is likely to be underestimated," the study suggests.
The Ecological Europe-Greens Society (EE-LV) proposed "creaking to the emergency" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase of civilizational diseases."
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the residue's state of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereal.
