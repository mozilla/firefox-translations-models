Twenty-eight-year-old chef found dead in a store in San Francisco
The twenty-eight-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was on the steps of a local store this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who wants to hurt him, adding: "He's finally started to thrive."
The body found in the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning has been identified as twenty-eight-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the medical examiner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said it was a violent death and an investigation was ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who was formerly a regular chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We have a small team that works as a close-knit family. We will miss him very much," the spokesman said.
During this difficult time, our thoughts and grief go out to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said Frank had initially slept in dormitories, but that recently "he has finally started to thrive."
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to connect with his family, he always cooked us food, made us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any argument.
He was a brother who took things as they were.
"Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an uncut diamond that he lit up every day," he said.

Czech Railways has invested more than CZK 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, the state-owned carrier has invested more than CZK 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
A third of the carriages are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amounts for modernization in individual years, with the exception of 2012, are gradually decreasing.
In the last six years, Czech Railways has invested more than CZK 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
A third of the carriages are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent resulted in a reduction in the average age by two years for locomotives and stand-alone units and by six years for conventional wagons.
The carrier invested a larger share of its investment in regional transport, where about 60 percent of the money was directed, and the company invested 40 percent in the renewal of long-distance vehicles.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years.
However, upgraded older vehicles are counted as brand new in this indicator.
If vehicle modernizations were not taken into account, the average age of ČD traction vehicles would increase by ten years.
On average, passenger wagons are slightly older, with an average age of 23 years when modernisations are taken into account.
If only the age from the date of manufacture is taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, classic trains consisting of wagons and hauled by a locomotive have gradually disappeared from the Czech and worldwide railways in recent years and are being replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the number of locomotives decreased from 280 to 223 pieces, and the number of classic wagons dropped from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
In particular, the carrier got rid of old vehicles equipped with leatherette seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening while driving.
Between January and July, the carrier had 110 of these cars scrapped.
Among the investments that ČD plans to make in the vehicle fleet in the near future, it is possible to mention, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds of up to 200 kilometres per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international route Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic express lines.
The contract provides for the purchase of up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electric units.
The authorities have known about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they are unable to get rid of it.
We are completely helpless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the editors of the online daily Aktuálně.cz have been following the story of a billboard in South Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where there is not only an interesting walk in the treetops, but also the Olympic Park.
Highway administrators know they are standing there illegally, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of similar ads across the country.
According to officials, the fault lies with a flimsy law that makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
What is needed is a complicated bureaucratic wheel.
In the meantime, however, the company changes its name and the office is short for it.
Or just move the ad a few meters and the official process has to start again.
A quarter of a year ago, the Road and Motorway Directorate admitted: on the main road from České Budějovice to Lipno, there is an advertising billboard on our land by the state road on the black.
But even three months were not enough for officials to get rid of an unauthorized portable structure with a giant advertising poster.
As if no one minded that he was standing right next to the road, in a fifty-meter protective zone, where nothing was allowed to stand for safety.
Road managers say they simply can't deal with the billboard because of the leaky law.
Maybe load it up and drive it away.
"We can't afford that," says Nina Ledvinová, spokeswoman for the Road and Motorway Directorate, referring to the complicated bureaucratic wheel that the removal of the billboard must be preceded by law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate the online daily Aktuálně.cz began to follow in detail in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and the authorities cannot solve effectively and quickly.
In South Bohemia alone, the editorial office counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules right next to or near the road.
The situation is similar in other regions.
"We have trouble forcing companies to remove the banners," confirms Jiří Klása, head of the transport department of the České Budějovice regional authority, whose colleagues deal with similar stories.
According to Klása, the culprit is a leaky law that binds officials.
First, he has to intricately approach the owner of the billboard to give the ad away.
But company bosses are often unbeatable, or they know the trick that Aktuálně.cz have already described in the past, when they began to take a closer look at the issue: just move the mobile advertising stand a few meters and officials can throw the previous call to remove black advertising in the trash.
This is because the authority must determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, it is seen as a new device and we have to address the owner again," explains Jiří Klása.
The new law will not help.
A change could be brought by a new law that will ban billboards on motorways from September next year and restrict them on category I roads.
Critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily portable advertising will remain the same as before.
And the authorities will not be relieved.
Companies can continue to earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year from renting illegal space, and no one can pay for them.
For example, the billboard attracting to Lipno belongs to the company Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: the České Budějovice municipality is currently conducting three administrative proceedings against her for illegally erected billboards.
The company faces a fine of three hundred thousand crowns in each proceeding.
These are multiple advertisements that were placed without permission in the protective zone of a class I road.
The proceedings have not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the Transport Department of the České Budějovice City Hall.
The ad that Aktuálně.cz is interested in is not yet one of these cases, but it will most likely be added soon.
According to RMD spokeswoman Nina Ledvinová, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will thus reach the table of regional and then probably municipal officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that cannot be contacted.
She does not take over the post office and closed her official headquarters in Žižkov more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who is behind it.
In the past, the company's post office went to the South Bohemian businessman Anton Fischer, who became famous for a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representation of the Hyundai brand.
Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard leases the space from Comerz Billboard and offers it to advertisers, has denied any connection in the past.
However, this spring, when RMD began to be interested in advertising Lipno at the instigation of Aktuálně.cz, Fischer had state officials send a letter to the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his guesthouse, where the company is allegedly based.
Even from this address, however, no one has contacted the highway administrators to this day.
A futile struggle.
Such silence or opaque changes of settlements are not uncommon.
A few years ago, we gradually fined one company two million crowns.
But it changed the name and ID number and there was nothing to solve.
The bailiff returned the case, the ads continued to stand, perhaps in other places.
We are quite powerless against such companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, one official admits on condition of anonymity.
The amendment to the law in this respect has not yet been addressed.
Aktuálně.cz spoke to several Members who were interested in the issue.
But they have not yet developed any activity.
On the contrary, there were deputies who wanted to extend the deadline for preserving billboards on the main Czech roads.
The government refused.
Billboards are not only for national, but also regional and municipal politicians a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand to limit them, on the other hand, they themselves need them for advertising in election campaigns.
I do not hold the relatively established impression that if something does not work, then it is necessary to change the laws.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more rapeseed and poppy seeds, statisticians estimate.
According to estimates by the Czech Statistical Office, this year's cereal harvest will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Yet this year's harvest exceeds the average for the past five or ten years.
On the other hand, rapeseed (by 3.9 percent) and poppy (2.5 percent) will be higher.
This year's cereal harvest will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Farmers harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
These are the results of an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office as of 15 July.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic, assuming a one-tenth decrease from last year.
However, last year's cereal harvest was above average.
This year's harvest exceeds the average for the last five and ten years.
On the contrary, the harvest of rapeseed and poppy seeds will be higher this year.
Rapeseed farmers harvest 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they got 1.256 million tons under their roof.
This year's poppy crop could be 2.5 percent higher than last year's.
The anticipated decline in cereal production is caused both by a decrease in the yield per hectare by 3.7 percent to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and by a decrease in the area under crops.
Farmers have sown three percent fewer fields this year.
Winter wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, is estimated to be harvested 3.3 percent less this year.
Farmers sowed it in more fields.
However, the decrease will be due to a lower yield per hectare, which will fall to 6.04 tonnes.
Statisticians expect a roughly one-fifth decrease in spring barley, which is most often used for beer production.
The reduction in harvest is due to a reduction in sown areas by 15.2 percent, as well as a lower yield per hectare.
Winter barley, on the other hand, yields 6.3 percent more.
The rye harvest will also increase.
Statisticians estimate the rapeseed crop at 1.305 million tons, which is more than last year.
The area under crops increased by 7.3 percent.
However, the yield per hectare will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's rapeseed crop will exceed the ten-year average by 13.3 percent, while the area sown is one-third larger than ten years ago.
In the last four years, poppy fields have also been increasing.
This year, farmers sowed it on 35,543 hectares.
Compared to 2008, when poppy was grown on a record 70,000 hectares in the Czech Republic, there are half of the fields.
Thanks to the expansion of the sown area, this year's poppy harvest will be richer.
It will rise by 2.5 percent compared to last year to 27,423 tonnes.
However, the yield per hectare will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police charged two men with knife and machete attack, and the court sent them to custody.
Police have charged two attackers who attacked a thirty-five-year-old man with a knife and machete in the center of Olomouc on Tuesday.
"Although the attacked man tried to escape, they caused him cutting and cutting injuries that required treatment in hospital and further treatment," police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková said.
Both apparent perpetrators were apprehended by police immediately after the attack.
The plaintiff filed a motion with the court to remand them and the court granted it on Friday.
Both men face three to ten years in prison.
Police accused two detainees of attacking a thirty-five-year-old man in the center of Olomouc with a knife and machete.
The attackers inflicted cuts and cuts on him, and he ended up in hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people that happened at noon on Tuesday on Svoboda Avenue, police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, Olomouc police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková said.
A mass skirmish between two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratorie bar in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal dispute, two attackers attacked a thirty-five-year-old man with a knife and a machete.
Although the attacked man tried to escape, he suffered cuts and cuts that required hospital treatment and further treatment, a police spokeswoman said.
The skirmish, which attracted a lot of attention in the city center and forced several police patrols and constables to intervene on the spot, involved family disputes.
Criminalists charged a thirty-four-year-old man from Slovakia and a thirty-seven-year-old man from Olomouc with attempted grievous bodily harm and disorderly conduct.
The plaintiff filed a petition with the court to remand them and the court granted it on Friday, the spokeswoman added.
A machete was also used in the center of Olomouc during a mass brawl by attackers five years ago, it happened just a few dozen meters away, in front of the Varna disco in Riegrova Street.
Police said at the time that a group of about a dozen foreigners with guns attacked guests of the restaurant who were standing outside the entrance.
According to police, they had knives, clubs and machetes in their hands.
The court then sentenced the two attacking foreigners to a suspended sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You will be surprised, maybe you walk around them every day.
One of the most glaring examples of an unused and empty house is the large building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of Senovážné Square.
It should have functioned as a hotel a long time ago.
But still nothing.
That it is necessary to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what about using the existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the center of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square, there are several apartment buildings that, despite their location, size and often monument protection, are just desolate and empty.
We selected the properties in the centre using the Prázdnédomy.cz project, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of financial problems of their owners, opaque relationships between companies, or belong to the state, which is unable or unwilling to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
Let the owners pay a special tax for them, the initiative wants

Mr. and Mrs. Clinton earned $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to release his tax returns.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, earned $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars were donated to charity by the Clintons.
Most of the Clintons' income — over six million dollars — is from their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax returns.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her tax returns on Friday, increasing pressure on her Republican rival, Donald Trump, to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, earned $10.6 million last year, the Associated Press reported.
Most of the Clintons' income — over $six million — is from their speeches, mostly from before April 2015, when Clinton launched her election campaign.
The tax report showed that Mr. and Mrs. Clinton paid 34.2 percent federal income tax last year, as well as state and local income tax of nine percent.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of their income in taxes.
But Trump has a problem with such a step, he has not yet decided to publish his tax return.
There is a possibility that Donald Trump pays no taxes at all, Clinton tweeted minutes after her confession was released.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to secrecy surrounding Trump's earnings, not least to raise doubts about whether her opponent is really as rich as she claims.
Trump's fortune is estimated at billions of dollars.
Lower earnings would damage the Republican candidate's reputation as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Kaine, who is running for vice president in tandem with the former first lady, today released a report on his tax payments over the past decade.
He and his wife, Anne Holton, gave 7.5 percent of their earnings to charity and paid 25.6 percent of their earnings in taxes last year.
Polio has broken out again in Nigeria.
Boko Haram Islamists prevented consistent vaccination and killed doctors.
Polio cases have resurfaced in Nigeria.
In the northeast of the country, the government has announced emergency vaccinations there, where two children infected with the disease have become paralyzed.
The vaccines were transported there by helicopters.
Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram were active in the affected area, preventing vaccination and even killing doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus circulated there undetected.
In northeastern Nigeria, emergency polio vaccinations for children will begin after two children infected with the disease have become paralyzed.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that one million children will be vaccinated in Borno state and another four million in surrounding countries.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday quickly delivered polio vaccines to the stricken northeastern part of the country, where Islamist Boko Haram terrorists are stationed.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been circulating undetected in the area for many years.
Boko Haram extremists have defended vaccinations in the past and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also made it impossible for doctors to reach areas where children with polio were found on Thursday.
Both affected toddlers arrived with refugees from the newly liberated part of Nigeria from Boko Haram.
Michel Zaffran, director of the WHO's polio eradication section, told the BBC that vaccinations in Nigeria would begin as early as next week.
The Islamic radical group Boko Haram has long been active in Borno state.
The area was only made available to international organizations and the government earlier this year, when Boko Haram was significantly weakened in this part of the country.
Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adewole admitted that the new polio cases were a big disappointment for the country because Nigeria wanted to announce polio eradicated next year.
The WHO warned that it was possible that although the disease had not appeared for two years, it was still spreading among children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all polio cases worldwide.
While polio was still present in 125 countries in 1988, it now persists in only three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan, and northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the moving stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis met with twenty former prostitutes who, thanks to the police, escaped from a gang of pimps.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and invited them to look confidently to the future.
With this meeting, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for the fight against it to be stepped up.
Pope Francis met in Rome with twenty former prostitutes who were freed by police from the power of a gang of pimps.
The head of the Catholic Church listened to the moving stories of the fallen women for more than an hour and then urged them to look confidently to the future, a Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one each from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All of them, according to the Vatican, were subjected to severe physical violence during forced prostitution.
With the visit, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for the fight against it to be stepped up, the pope's spokesman said.
Francis often draws attention to the fate of people on the margins of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived at the Vatican in April and June this year thanks to his personal invitation.
France will strike the jihadist factories.
But it will not be possible without the help of Muslims.
Muslims themselves are to help France fight radical Islamism.
In addition, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Valls is preparing fundamental changes in the functioning of mosques and the education of clerics.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mosques and places of worship.
And more will follow, the interior minister announced.
There are over a hundred jihadist factories in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state in its fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom of this religion," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
In particular, it intends to ensure that only imams who have been educated in France preach in mosques and prayer rooms.
At the same time, he wants to stop foreign funding of mosques.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money for the construction of new mosques comes from abroad, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
This is one of the reasons why preachers who can sow radicalism in France are brought to mosques.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," he added.
The key to ensuring that he fulfills these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should act as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
The French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then-Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, is now operating in the country.
Even then, the foundation was supposed to contribute to making the financial flows between mosques and the countries financing their construction more transparent.
But the institution was soon hit by internal divisions and rivalries.
"It's a total failure," Valls said recently.
After the attack on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate about a new institution to replace the defunct foundation flared up on the French political scene.
Everything was precipitated by further terrorist attacks in France, carried out in the name of the Islamic State by radicalized Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently said that a new foundation will be created this October.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure domestic funding for mosques and also to supervise imams.
For now, it is not clear where he will get the money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also for various educational centers.
However, several proposals are under consideration.
One of them is a special fee or tax on halal foods.
In practice, this would be paid by halal food vendors to provide certification.
Part of this money would then go to the foundation's coffers.
A contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 of them go there on a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not only that.
According to the prime minister, in the future only preachers who have undergone special education programs at French universities should work in mosques.
This should ensure that preaching is consistent with democracy.
We will close radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is in a crusade against radicals.
And more will follow, the interior minister announced recently.
There is no place in France for those who preach hatred in mosques and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
There are an estimated 2500 mosques and places of worship in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, authorities have deported about 80 imams and are considering several dozen more.
But not everyone thinks the government's actions can take a significant step against radicalism.
Those who want to become radicalized will do the same.
It doesn't happen in mosques, young people are radicalized online, said Severine Labat, an expert at the National Center for Scientific Research.
Kelemen lost in the 1st round of the sprint to star Baugé.
To advance to the eight-finals, the Czech track cyclist must fight in the repechages.
Track cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, after advancing from the qualification of the sprint among the top eighteen, lost in the 1st round a duel with the French great Grégory Baugé, the defending silver medalist from the previous Games in London.
To advance to the eight-finals, they have to fight in repechages.
There were 27 riders at the start of the royal discipline on the track and the best Czech track rider of the present time scored the fourteenth best time.
He managed the two-hundred with a flying start in 9.969 seconds.
In the main knockout phase, he faced fifth Baugé in qualifying, who already has a bronze medal in the team sprint from Rio.
Although Kelemen was harassing the experienced Frenchman in the end, he watched the procedure.
Defending gold medalist Jason Kenny had a great performance.
The twenty-eight-year-old Briton set the third fastest two-hundred in history and won the qualification in an Olympic record of 9.551.
As expected, he also easily dealt with the last advancing, the German Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet with Bradley Wiggins was also successful, setting a new world record of 3:50.570 in the 4 km pursuit race and advancing to the final.
The previous maximum (3:51.659), which the British had been for four years since the London Olympics, was improved by more than a second.
Young doctors push: They want fresh air in the field
Representatives of young doctors met to approve new steps in their dispute over a new contract.
The British Medical Association's (BMA) Young Doctors' Council (JDC) must ask the entire board to support further industry events in early September.
JDC says ministers have failed to resolve issues over the treaty.
In July, young doctors and medical students voted to reject the contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who participated in the election.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC chairwoman Ellen McCourt said the government had "remained silent" on questions, leading to the rejection of the contract.
She said: "In this light, the JDC executive body has voted to reject the proposed new treaty altogether and to request new formal negotiations on all issues."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Executive Board today formally requested a special BMA board meeting to approve the ongoing program of escalating industry events in early September.
The dispute has led young doctors to call six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in NHS history.
The leader of the junior doctors at BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which the BMA recommended.
He told BMA members at meetings before the vote in front of 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the agreement was a good one and should be accepted.
After the vote, the health minister said the contract would be a burden on medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance of the "incompatible"?
It was a gesture that ended in crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the formal end of an eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the sumptuous hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin wasn't smiling, and he barely radiated warmth, even by his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken about his "dear friend" Mr. Putin - five times, according to one of the reports.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis levels, but would be even better.
The next day, a local newspaper wrote that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm revealed the exact opposite.
But the lingering coldness that emanated from Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: Turkey's downing of a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin threw punches around and accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The scandal was all the greater because it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding true trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
For months, the state-controlled media has waged a massive nationwide campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
More serious were allegations from top officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He emphatically denied this.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a ceasefire are clear.
First and foremost, Erdogan was nearly removed from power in a failed coup last month and therefore needs all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have visibly shaken him as well.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have had a hard impact - in particular, the cancellation of charter flights that annually carry several million Russian tourists to the coast of Turkey.
This number has decreased by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly breathe a sigh of relief when flights are eventually resumed.
They make money from Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when imports of agricultural commodities from Turkey are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as a report in the newspaper Vedemosti proclaimed.
But the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it sees as a poor response to the coup attempt.
In addition, long-standing hostility has led to lengthy talks on EU accession and the entry of Putin - who is eager to take advantage of the cooling and sever Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly got bonus points when Ankara asked for help from elected authorities after the coup attempt.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-seated fear of regime change, this is a given.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to demonstrate what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of the incompatible": how two countries that feel rejected and used by the West join forces.
However, despite the fact that they have publicly demonstrated mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently positioned itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are on opposite sides.
You could say that after nearly three hours of initial talks, the two presidents said at a press conference that they had not even mentioned the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering a question about the differences between them, while Putin chose to highlight these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which the two states can find common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of utter disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian warplane - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand should be relegated to the role of back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
Of these, it relieved when it almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At the time, strategist brands were using "RBS" to protect other consumer finance brands.
It has been backed by millions of pounds spent on sponsorship of international sport, from the Six Nations Rugby Championship to Winblehouse champion Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to make national brands stand out more.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scottish customers, but will not launch new business.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of headquarters and stock coding on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that are coming to the fore – Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During his trips to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered questions from Ross McEwan.
He told BBC Scotland: "RBS will cease to be our investor brand and the brand that our employees work for as we become much more of a brand bank."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have domestic aspirations.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities, and our workers will work under those brands.
RBS has already said it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations championship, preparing a profile of the individual sports sponsorship brands.
"Is this a good time for us to move to a brand bank, because the fundamental question (that we are asking) is how do we focus on becoming a better bank for customers?"
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical to say that we would become a great bank for customers and introduce those brands.
But along with the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think there's a lot of change going on.
We can remind you of these brands, I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on Predilection led the 3,000th winner to the finish
Dettori splashes champagne after a double win in Newmarket earned him 3,000 victories
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th win in Britain at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached this milestone with his second victory of the evening on his local track - the Predilection, a horse trained by John Gosden.
The forty-five-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in flat racing.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion Dettori, who previously won on the horse Ghayyar, said: "It's special."
I am very touched because my family is also here
I am extremely glad that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I anchored 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not Royal Ascot – it's a Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations as he brings in Predilection after victory
Two jockeys have reached this milestone in hurdle racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who have led more than 4,300 winners to the finish during his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it is no surprise that he has reached a milestone that only a few riders before him have reached.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical fister that sets him apart from other riders in the weigh-in.
He is a fantastic ambassador for horse racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to the sport for years.
A few weeks ago I told Frankie at Epsom that if he didn't just do weekends and big races, he would already have 6,000 winners!
But the truth is that Frankie has ridden winners in the UK for the better part of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He has a lively character, which is good for British horse racing. But more importantly, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous flying jump
From fleeting finishes to flying jumps, Frankie Dettori has been the messenger boy in British flat racing for two decades.
It was like a roller coaster ride.
A plethora of big race winners, including his famous "magnificent seven" at Ascot. He also survived a plane crash and was banned from taking off for drugs.
Three years ago, he stagnated for the first time when he returned from a 6-month driving ban, but he showed incredible inner strength and returned in top form despite all the doubters.
And it may not be the last time - Dettori has previously stated that he would like to continue racing until at least 50 years old.
Russian President Putin fires presidential chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday unexpectedly sacked Sergei Ivanov as chief of staff.
Ivanov was one of Putin's closest aides for many years.
Sixty-three-year-old Ivanov was appointed special representative for ecology and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said Putin had "released Ivanov from his services as head of Russia's presidential office," but no reason was given.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012.
Forty-four-year-old Vajno was formerly a diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
The website (in Russian) states that he later worked as the head of presidential protocol and the presidential office.
In appointing Putin, he said: "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities as a head of state in terms of drafting laws and checking to what extent your instructions are followed.
Putin told Russian television on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to be released from his post and recommended that Vayno replace him.
Will smiles convince?
This move completely mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest associates and, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, broadcast on state television, the two men said they were leaving the post of chief of staff at their own request.
But the smiles on the cameras convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of some power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man once considered a possible president suddenly wanted to lead Russia's environmental policy was met with great disbelief.
On the Kremlin website, notes addressed to Putin are quoted as saying: "It is true that in 2012 I asked you in an interview to entrust me with this very demanding post, one could even say a problematic post, for four years.
Apparently, I was the head of the president's office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
Prior to that, he held the positions of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, previously worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 90s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he appointed Ivanov as one of his five closest aides.
At one time, there was even speculation that Ivanov could succeed Putin as head of state after his second term, because a third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But the post was taken over by another close associate of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later before returning to the presidency.
Thomas Gibson, star of "Criminal Minds," was fired after hitting the director
Gibson was embroiled in a physical exchange on stage in Los Angeles last month.
ABC and CBS, which produce the series, announced his release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played special agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before announcing his firing.
There were creative differences on the scene and disagreements.
I am sorry that this has happened," he said in a statement.
According to statements from ABC and CBS, the details of how the character of Gibson will disappear from the series, which follows the stories of a team of FBI agents, are a little later.
The fifty-four-year-old actor, best known for his starring role in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has appeared on the series since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Thoughts and have put my heart and soul into it over the past twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I hoped to be in it until the end. But that will not be possible now.
I would also like to express my thanks to the writers, producers, actors, our amazing team and above all the great fans this show could have hoped for.
The series is expected to return to season twelve on September 28.
In the town of Banff, fish mysteriously landed in a garden
A man from the town of Banff asked for help in identifying fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish may be sand eels left behind by the waterstorm.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a short film of his find on the Periscope Canal, thinking someone could help him explain how the 5-centimeter fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects with Fife
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers connected the North Plateau and Queensferry Crossing and the viaduct - the bridge now connects to Fife.
This is the first of four closures between the "platform fans" that are now almost completed around each of the bridge's three pylons.
The section of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tonnes of iron and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 suspension cables.
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment in the building of Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we all witness how civil engineers used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this section of the bridge on a truly impressive scale.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge platform was a delicate operation that required extraordinary precision.
In total, more than 79% of the bridge's total area is now in place, and the concrete for the last parts of the platform is now being cast in Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to be lifted onto the bridge.
Michael Martin, project leader at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure in the construction of any bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the pinnacle of civil engineering.
After installing the last part of the road platform and connecting it to the North Tower expansion platform, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by extending the northern approach viaduct 700 millimeters to the south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled with a gradient of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances with which the team worked were very small - only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Moelfre Bay rescue: Three men 'happy to be alive'
Three men are "happy to be alive" after being washed away by water from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station sounded the alarm at 13:20 UK summer time on Friday after the crew saw the incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety while their boat continued uncontrollably.
"We saw their boat circling near them and thought the worst," said Moelfre lifeboat helmsman Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong wind blew him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while a third man, aged 60, was found without a life jacket exhausted holding onto a buoy.
They were all taken aboard the shore lifeboat and transported back to the lifeboat station
Jones said: "The three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had an emergency shutdown rope, but somehow it was disconnected from the person steering the boat when it capsized.
Someone from above held a protective hand over the boys.
The judge refuses to hear the case because of Tluchoř's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of three deputies who, according to the indictment, were supposed to receive a political tobacconist, i.e. a lucrative post for a political concession, from Prime Minister Nečas and his then head of the cabinet, Jana Nagyová.
In 2012, the tax package was approved.
Šnajdr, Fuksa and Tluchoř made it possible with their resignations.
Then they appeared in influential positions in state-owned companies.
That is why they also faced suspicion of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, unjustifiably, and they received compensation in total of almost 2 million crowns.
Tluchoř is now acting as a witness in the case, following the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in the courthouse at Ovocný trh and deals with civil disputes.
Nevertheless, Judge Helena Králová wants to be cautious and avoid possible objections.
The case will probably be handled by another Prague judicial district.
Králová has already twice acquitted Jana Nečasová, formerly Nagyová.
It was an alleged misuse of military intelligence to spy on the first wife of Prime Minister Nečas Radka.
Tluchoř was not involved in this case.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, however, this is an unnecessarily exaggerated reaction.
I do not think that impartiality can be interpreted in such a way as to exclude the court if the witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
"I'm afraid nothing could be judged then," he told the newspaper.
"It seems crazy to me," he added.
Roman Boček, a former official, is also charged in the case of political newsagents.
According to his lawyer Petr Toman, however, any objection would have a chance of success.
On 13 June, the District Court for Prague 1 heard the indictment of the former head of Prime Minister Petr Nečas's cabinet, Jana Nagyová (now Nečasová), and other defendants in the case of misuse of Military Intelligence.
In the picture, Nečasová and her husband come to court.
Tluchořová was supposed to deal with statements about Peroutka.
The wife of an ex-MP, for example, was supposed to judge President Miloš Zeman's remarks about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutka.
Zeman said he sympathized with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl apparently died in an air raid by Allied forces.
She flew to Syria with her two girlfriends of the same age from London's Gatwick Airport in February last year.
The Home Office did not comment on the news of her death.
Young Londoners who fled their homes were secretly taken to Syria via the Turkish border, according to police.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abace and Kadiza Sultana have headed to see another former classmate from London's Bethnal Green Academy, according to media reports.
The case sparked a huge wave of attention last year, as well as tensions in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that about 600 British Muslims, including about 50 young women and girls, have travelled to Syria so far.
Many of them have joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
A dream job for a salary of a hundred thousand crowns.
A well-paid job for which you don't even need college.
This is what the work of an IT guy looks like at first glance.
And often on the latter.
The advantage is not only an extremely high salary for Czech standards (in Prague you can earn up to CZK 180,000 by working in IT), but also extreme benefits.
The reason is a huge shortage of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
According to estimates, there is a shortage of almost 20,000 IT specialists in the Czech Republic.
According to statistics from the Grafton recruitment agency, the most wanted are programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
Therefore, candidates do not compete for a job, but jobs for candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager at Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
Higher education is not a necessity for IT students.
Higher education is a good foundation and is an overall indicator of a candidate's intelligence and trainability, but it often has little to do with development knowledge.
Developers must constantly learn new things, which once a university graduate will not replace, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
The most earnings are in Prague.
The wages of IT workers are everywhere far above the national average.
They get the most money in Prague and Brno, in the regions it is not such a chart.
"Wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Kubačka confirms.
Technical directors will earn the highest.
In Prague and Brno they can come to 120 000 - 180 000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but even there it does not fall below CZK 80,000.
IT project managers are also in demand.
They can earn 60 000 - 100 000 CZK upon arrival.
There is also a fight for graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the labor office, this does not apply to IT people.
If companies overpay for an expert from another company, they will be happy to reach for a graduate.
They can raise it on their own.
They cannot do without language.
Knowledge of a foreign language is useful in every profession, but at least decent English is necessary for IT students.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a must for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we encounter a number of cases where companies are looking for a professionally educated and experienced person and are satisfied with only an average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a support worker speaks more foreign languages, he or she is interesting for his employer because he or she can serve more customers from different countries, adds director Kubačka.
Oh yes, there's paradise in Google.
Only silently can Czech workers envy employees at Google.
Of course there are flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home or various part-time jobs, not only for mothers.
"For new dads, the company gives four extra weeks of vacation after the birth of their child," says Martina Joneková, a Google spokeswoman.
Pampering also includes health care for employees and family, meals, transport, training, wellness or massages directly at the workplace.
Who wants to educate, has the green light and it does not matter what new he wants to learn.
But the benefits don't stop there.
Such a full fridge for free is also definitely not to be missed.
A healthy lunch (in some locations as well as breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called micro-kitchens in all offices, where people can always find a healthy snack, the spokesperson reveals.
And so that nothing has to be thrown away, what is not eaten, he puts in boxes that employees can take home in the evening.
And the reason for these unbelievable advantages by Czech standards?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"For Google, the important thing is not that employees sit in the office for eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, progress or development, ideas and innovative solutions," the spokesperson adds.
The UN has sharply criticized Bulgaria for criminalizing refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the UN commissioner for human rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "raises serious concerns about Bulgaria's failure to comply with international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
He warned that "it is particularly disturbing to see important and influential public figures publicly expressing support for criminal armed militias that brazenly conduct hunts for refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey."
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross into Bulgarian territory irregularly are automatically arrested," Zeid stressed.
Worse still, they are often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or more - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalised, despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria has detained 14,000 migrants this year, compared to 21,000 during the same period last year.
Pokémon Go - the pursuit of health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to watch how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many people have lamented that teenagers and children no longer play outdoors and prefer to spend their free time over screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people off their couches and leads them to activity.
Screen time has initially shrunk to television, then video games, and most recently smartphones.
It's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I'm talking, of course, about the fashion that is Pokémon Go, an application based on characters that first appeared in video games in the late 90s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest in the US, Australia and New Zealand ahead of the launch of the new game in early July.
Rollout in other countries was then postponed due to massive interest, which led to overloading servers.
Pokémon Go gained more users than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter has in just a few days.
How does it work?
In short, players on their smartphones go out looking for Pokémon to track them using GPS, and when they find them, they can "take a picture" (via a screenshot on their phone) or "catch" them.
Mania has gripped the generation that played the game at a younger age, lifting it out of its seats and rushing out in search of Pokémon.
In the US, thanks to this game, there has been a significant increase in the number of steps that the "average" person takes every day.
Apple's smartwatch app Cardiogram, which has 35,000 followers, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people who exercised for 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't have information about who is playing Pokémon Go — it only sees raw data on exercise levels.
Many public campaigns to "find 30," "get off the couch," and "be active every day" have fallen on barren ground because most public health messages are boring and aimed at people who don't look well.
Still, the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of getting cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we can't list in full here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
Thus, you cover the three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sun rays. And fun.
Some people even make new friends in the hunt for Pokémon.
As it happens, there are, of course, some boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can walk in the door.
And what, like?
There was a breakthrough.
In their time, smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our activity, but they didn't give us a reason to do anything like this game did.
The novelty wears off and interest in it begins to fade at some point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, more games will emerge that will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many people in their quest for activity, health and better shape.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's all-around gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on skip.
Effortless on the beam.
Everyone was speechless at the simple.
Excellent in everything.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The nineteen-year-old American gymnast took the direct path to the all-around title on Thursday and surpassed the others at full speed under the Olympic spotlights.
The overall result of 62.198 clearly confirmed her lead over silver medalist and member of the "final five" team Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafinova.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during her performance on the balance beam in the individual all-around finals in artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American woman in a row to win the all-around and fifth overall, confirming her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
When her overall final ranking was on the board and her long journey up to this point was over, tears appeared on her face.
This achievement puts her in the same league of the rare athletes of her time as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to the sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at world championships - including 10 gold. Her stunning routines are a mixture of ambition and precision, and 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
The final stage awaited her in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the riders, but between herself and the burden of too high expectations.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas with a hand full of gold medals would be seen as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning gold and silver medals in the women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles got her first Tuesday when she was like an exclamation point in the celebration of outgoing national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists she has never looked forward during her long journey to the top, which is not entirely true.
Part of her line-up in plain – the one that features her typical triple flip double flip – is set in Latin music that would just fit home, on the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
This is no coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and her talent was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother on the way to the gym where Boorman trained and where he gained strength.
She hasn't lost a multisport event since the summer of 2013 — a string of victories that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafin took the lead briefly with two turns, it was an illusion.
The hammer and the simple - where Biles is defending the world championship - are waiting.
She regained the lead with 15.433 points for the beam - and finished with 15.933 points in the simple ones.
Raisman hugged her gently as they waited for the final score—a mere formality—and tears appeared around the shimmering red, white, and blue shadows as a wish she had written in her diary came true.
Raisman's performance was something of revenge for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared third place with Mustafin, but then won bronze due to the sum of the top three routines.
This time, the twenty-two-year-old captain of the team, whom the Americans call "grandma", was far ahead.
After her simple ones, she sent air kisses to the crowd, overcome by a return that seemed uncertain at times.
For Biles, the nineteen-year-old athlete's post this week on Twitter, where it became a complete hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial killer case shot dead while listening to music in car
According to a police report released Thursday, two women and a girl aged 12 died in the most serious attack of the decade, the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot as they sat in their cars, chatting and listening to music.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead in a car parked in the driveway on June 12.
The report said the armed man was on the passenger side and fired eight rounds from a handgun. He then fled in another vehicle.
According to police, the triple murder was not a robbery because the attacker did not take wallets or the $2,900 that one of the adult victims was carrying.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said investigators are looking into whether the shooting was linked to any of the previous four attacks.
There have been a total of nine attacks in two Hispanic-majority neighborhoods over a four-month period, killing seven people and injuring two others.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of houses," Howard told CBS's KPHO earlier this month.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late 90s, a black BMW from the late 90s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators declined to reveal what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to hospital where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report of a shooting that targeted an empty van just half an hour before the triple murder. Police believe it was caused by the serial killer.
Investigators found shell casings and assembled a bullet from bullet residues in the seat and from under the hood of the engine.
Mother of a six-year-old child with microcephaly: "His condition is improving"
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, which is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all – of course you're ready for it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, learned that Edmund might never know them or survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in an institution.
"My first reaction was that I thought people don't do that anymore," Picciuto explains.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Until the age of three, he could neither sit nor crawl. And they still don't speak.
However, it is already slowly fulfilling some milestones.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth performs sign language that Edmund uses to say "please sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's no ordinary sign language - he says Edmund invented some of the signs himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, as is the case with Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary substantially.
It is too early to say what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of those infected.
Picciuto recalls the emotional toll taken by an uncertain future.
I keep asking, "What's next?"
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
In fact, I've never asked what the overall prognosis is, because I don't expect anyone to be able to tell me at all.
But Picciuto has encouraging news for mothers of all children suffering from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
Know that it will be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and flooding necessitated rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. More rains are expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) reported that after extreme downpours, a number of rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi will overflow their banks, threatening widespread flooding.
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on its way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's office for national security and emergency preparedness, said they were receiving requests for water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said the Tangipahoa district alone had asked for ten thousand sandbags.
Flood watches will remain working in much of southern Louisiana through Saturday.
The weather service said in a statement that another 8 to 13 centimetres of rain could fall over the sea.
In southern Alabama, flood watch was on alert Friday as rains continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite Rivers near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are forecast to peak over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both said they could flood a number of homes in suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He said the danger was flooding downstream in the Ascension district, where these swollen streams would only slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, a little further south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest recorded level at 9 a.m. local time on Friday.
Rescuers are still recovering people from storm waters in County Amite and Wilkinson in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued at Gloster earlier on Friday.
Hansford, 62, said water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 yards from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said he was alerted by his other stepson, who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was coming," Hansford said.
I had it up to my waist.
According to his wife, this is the highest level she has ever experienced on the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said he and all members of his family are disabled and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three huge military-style trucks and transported them to Gloster Fire Station, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that as heavy rains continue, flooding is "spreading rapidly" and authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston reported that 35 centimeters of rain fell between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been heavily soaked since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rain and paid travel required residents to be rescued from their homes in Tangipahoa district and classes were cancelled in five school districts.
A CBS branch of WWL reported that 200 homes had been flooded, according to an elder from Tangipahoa.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
Mayor Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped by the high water.
Shelters have been set up in the community of Amite and the town of Hammond for those who have been evacuated.
"They will be able to return home when the water starts to subside," he said.
In Tangipahoa District in Hammond City, more than 20 streets were closed due to flooding and local residents were provided with sandbags to pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"The last major flooding we had here was in March," said Lacy Landrum, the town's administrator.
It looks like these floods will be similar.
Rupert Lacy, emergency manager in Harrison, Mississippi, said persistent rain continues on the Gulf coast.
He said a few homes were reported flooded on Thursday, but on Friday none of them were reported again.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "Boy Shot Like a Gun Gun," survives Philadelphia shooting
According to police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia. This week marks the second shooting of a 6-year-old child in the city.
The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahai Brown.
Grandparents say the boy suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when he was transported to hospital.
"He got so much, his little body was shot through," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the station that the boy should recover.
He was supposed to start the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three other men were also shot: two aged 29 and one aged 32.
One of the men, aged 29, is in critical condition, while two other victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
According to the station's report, a child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a twenty-nine-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there was likely a shootout between several armed men.
Shell casings from offensive weapons belonging to various assault weapons were found at the scene.
By all accounts, it was definitely an ongoing battle.
On the street, there were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it appears that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved," Philadelphia Police Capt. Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No one has been detained and police are reportedly examining video footage from cameras.
Another six-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a stray bullet outside a home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood on Tuesday.
The girl is recovering and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I envision the women's gymnast team for this year's Olympics, for several reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And second, there are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired so many young girls of color.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which is complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish descent, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
It also cemented the presence of black and Latino women at the top of the sport.
The number one gymnast for the past four years has been an African-American.
Simone and Gabby were number one and second last year, respectively.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became the Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who performed unexpected but masterful gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to win gold in the women's individual all-around.
And team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are witnessing a sporting peak, but in gymnastics classes in the country it does not look like that.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie made the same journey to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are the "final five" because the gymnast team for the next Olympics will consist of only four athletes, and this is the last year that Marta Karolyi is training.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a costly sport and gymnasts train mostly in private gymnastics clubs that maintain parents who pay the costs of training, equipment, travel, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their wards and families). And that's not all.
Most of these sports clubs are in affluent areas in the suburbs that can support the activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all the training, and for the families of gymnasts and gymnasts, it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes when they started gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics training that is more accessible and accessible to the communities of the countless young girls that Simone, Gabby and Laurie have inspired.
I founded the gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free or low-cost gymnastics in Harlem to more than 15,000 young people within the city (primarily black and Hispanic background), and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifetime benefits for good health, success in school and at work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics. And that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simon, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing "girlish strength" and winning Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to embark on the journey to become healthy, strong, and successful young women.
Following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to go on strike
Ministers had hoped that a revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would end disagreements over the changes. But 58 percent of the 37,000 junior doctors who participated in the election rejected the contract.
Hunt revealed plans to enforce the contract in July, saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and further delays would have a detrimental impact on staff and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that includes changes in night and weekend work practices to improve care during non-social hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Young Physician Commission, said in a statement last night: "Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly in the sense that the current workforce crisis will increase and therefore all doctors will be treated fairly."
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors comes under a new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
BMA efforts to resolve disputes through negotiation have been met with reluctance to involve Dr and often deafening silence on the part of the government.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that the option is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, push for enforcement and address the concerns of young doctors."
If this does not happen, then young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 visits were postponed as nurses and specialists were called in to replace doctors who were among the protesters.
Ministers had hoped that a revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would see a disagreement over the changes.
The BMA wants higher weekend work payments for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be the subject of a contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of the NHS employers, urged young doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: "Industry-specific action will achieve little or nothing, but it will put pressure on already overstretched teams and services and increase concern, exhaustion and disruption for patients, caregivers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have been in talks with the Young Doctors Council and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervisors and informants.
Employers had hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues – such as workload, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, training costs, subject mutual recognition, study leave and the gender pay gap – was a testament to how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were taking the agreements reached with the BMA in November.  February and May.
A drug for sixty crowns a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take a drug that costs about sixty crowns (two pounds). Authorities recommend giving it to more patients for a longer period of time.
The anti-clotting drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of having a seizure again in people with heart disease.
The drug is now given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or other attack.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them suffer another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fat, which forms a continuous layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer is torn off, a blood clot may form, blockage blood access to the heart and heart attack may develop.
If the clot is released, it can continue through the bloodstream, blocking the blood supply to the brain and causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at higher risk of having another attack.
Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by Britain's AstraZeneca and sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces the risk by making clots less likely to form.
The NICE draft directive published today recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin, twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Centre for Technology Assessment, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there is a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who suffer another heart attack or stroke – often with devastating consequences.
Fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a patient's quality of life.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
We are pleased that with the preliminary recommendation of ticagrelor, we can expand the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it.
As information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, the proposal does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
With computer culture, fraud began to flourish in Muslim areas
Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, linked to a government report
A culture of political correctness has led to a disregard for widespread fraud in Muslim communities, a government report said today.
Ex-minister Sir Eric Pickles has sharply criticised police, election inspectors and town halls for ignoring voter abuse due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
The former community secretary, now the ruler of the anti-corruption crackdown, said intimidation of voters on the basis of their religion was so bad that police should cordons outside polling stations to protect alerted voters.
He recommended that voters take their ID with them so that they can prove who they are when they vote.
At present, voters only need to give their name and address.
The report also proposes to apply indelible ink to people's fingers when casting their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, Pickles says.
It calls for the press to be given greater access to meeting documents and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not only about protecting against election fraud, but also protecting the local government from the wider corrupt environment and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street in the wake of an election scandal in Tower Hamlets, west London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the city's incumbent mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from his post following allegations of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically affected" the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, in his words, "conducted his campaign in such a way that it was the religious duty of devout Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes have been challenged or as a result of identity theft, where a person votes and impersonates someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concern about fraud in postal voting — which is alleged to have involved older members of the Muslim community pressured people to vote for the candidate they had chosen.
Sir Eric, pictured, gave some advice on how to clean up the voting system, including presenting proof of identity
His report states: "Evidence has been presented that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of their elders, particularly in communities originating from Pakistan and Bangladesh."
"There were concerns that... State institutions turned a blind eye to such behavior because of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including banning political activists from manipulating postal ballots to prevent "vote extraction."
The report, now being reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for more thorough checks on registrations to prevent the use of electoral rolls for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider asking voters to present proof of identity before voting.
Using indelible ink on people's fingers when voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Carrying out systematic national checks to ensure that people can vote.
Requests for automatic postal voting should be limited to three years.
Ban political agitators and activists from manipulating mail-in ballots and election envelopes.
Give the police the authority to form cordons around polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier to prosecute those exerting unlawful coercion under the 1983 Reform Act.
Ban the taking of photos at polling stations.
Require that only English people (with the exception of Wales) work at polling stations.
Strengthen training to ensure that workers follow the rule that voters go to polling booths individually.
Sir Eric criticises London police, saying it is "surprising" that no criminal charges have been brought following the Tower Hamlets case.
"The Election Court has expelled Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the strength of the evidence of the crime.
He also criticizes the fruitless "check-in checks" in voter registration departments at City Hall.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court decision in the Tower Hamlets case was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some authorities threaten that reputation.
Infatuated with the cycling doppelganger of Duchess Kate and other celebrity doubles at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics this week went crazy with French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who bears a striking resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the twenty-four-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete vying for gold this year who boasts her own celebrity double - at least not according to social media.
To celebrate the Rio Olympics and all the celebrities currently appearing on our screens, the FEMAIL women's column has compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
Like hunted game: American archer team member Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to Kate's double on the bike track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin brother of star Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. archer Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter after images surfaced of him strikingly resembling a Wall Street wolf.
Brady himself noticed the media frenzy and admitted that he had heard about his resemblance to Lee since he was a child.
"He doesn't see much resemblance himself, except maybe a beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a dude and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be highlighted even more this year: the striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafinova, with her large, expressive eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when it comes to the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Gell star Matthew Morrison for several years.
And for a change: A user thinks Nathan with an "athletic version" of the actor from the movie Inception
Another long-standing comparison is that of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimova not only boasts the same dark skin and blond hair as Annalynne McCord. And Nathan Adrian of Team USA is described by fans as looking like "an athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Able-bodied women: soccer star Hope Solo (left) and series actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar face and eye shapes
Not just one: A Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed the similarities
On the waves of theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of the couples
One Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are truly identical."
Soccer star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have incredibly similar face and eye shapes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, or gold medal winner for gymnastics Gabby Douglas, who boasts a beautifully wide smile that seems to copy that of Gabrielle Union, star of Bravo, girls!
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer "blew up."
Viewers of Wednesday's live broadcast of the Olympics on CBC were outraged by commentator Byron MacDonald's analysis of fourteen-year-old Ai Yanhan's performance. The swimmer finished fourth in the women's 4x200 m freestyle relay
Canada's CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said the fourteen-year-old Chinese swimmer "dragged like a stink" and "exploded" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone had been switched off when he began spouting his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring "revival" to the CBC commentator team, said, among other things, "That little fourteen-year-old from China has given up, you fool."
Too much excitement, stretched like a stink, exploded.
Thanks to.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swam the second relay of the race in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck - and allowed the Canadians to catch China.
Viewers in Canada quickly began to make themselves heard online and were horrified by the tone and language the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: "Did the CBC announcer claim that a fourteen-year-old swimmer from China 'blew up'????"
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the air."
Ai Yangan of China in the final of the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay was described as: "That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool."
Criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came from all sides, with many calling for his removal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn't hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists#znechucení.
Soon after, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's live commentary, saying, "We apologize for the leaked comment on the swimmer's performance."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we are sorry that it happened."
CBC eventually apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to a comment
Co-commentator Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
The CBC then copied and pasted their apology into a response to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The station also quickly apologized and released a statement.
He sincerely regrets that the words were spoken, they should not have been put on the air.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and to those who follow us on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron apologizes deeply for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast and tried to explain his remark by saying he didn't want it to sound like a personal attack.
"I would now like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said in a broadcast from the Olympics broadcast on CBC.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not the person of the swimmer as such."
"Needless to say, I didn't intend any disrespect, and I'm very sorry."
Primark customers outraged by woman shamelessly trying on lingerie in the middle of a store
When the woman undressed to try on her panties on the sales floor in the middle of the Primark, shoppers weren't sure which way to look.
To make matters worse, she tried to see how the size fit, took off her panties and put them back on the shelf.
She continued browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of panties at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Flokestone.
A Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where a woman tried on her panties before putting them back on the shelf
Mother-of-two Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at the time, said the mysterious woman, after trying on her underwear, "redressed and walked out of the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe their eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, grabbed her panties off the shelf, took off her own tights and panties, and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place – she just stood there, cheeky as a monkey."
"Everyone just stared as she took her panties off again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same with three others before finally deciding she didn't like anything, dressed again, and left.
"She didn't seem to mind who was watching—or even thinking about the person who might buy the panties she was trying on."
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "The idea of someone taking home panties that someone else was wearing and nobody cleaned them. That's disgusting."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Miss Davidson added: "When she left, I picked up things that she was obviously trying to get out of sale – which is also the only right thing to do."
"I would be terrified to bring home a new pair of panties and find that another woman was wearing them, took them off and that they weren't washed."
A Primark store spokesman said: "Primark is aware of an incident that occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday 9 August."
All the products concerned were withdrawn from sale.
How to defend yourself against a weapon attack with Krav Maga
The outside world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhone Mizrachi, the Grand Master of the Krav Magy Federation based in New York, to find out how to deal with armed looters at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain the upper hand over your abuser, whether they approach you from the front or from behind.
If they approach you from behind, Mizrachi says, then the first thing you need to do is turn around to see your attacker and "have a clear path of the shot."
You then grab the gun between your forearm and shoulder just before hitting it in the face with your free elbow.
Then follows the knee to the groin, and while the attacker writhes in pain, you wriggle the gun out of his hand, hit him in the face with the barrel and begin to retreat, holding the gun pointed at him.
If an armed man approaches you from the front, this is a similar technique - get your body out of the firing line, grab the weapon and twist it out so that the villain cannot shoot.
At the same time, force the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then wriggle the weapon out of his grasp and start to retreat, still aiming at him.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way to get out of a robbery - unless you are a Krav Maga Grandmaster - is to issue all your cash.
Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe in a travel guide
A British traveler decided to put his immune system and gag reflex to the test - by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Suffolk-born presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, licked a euro banknote, the railing of Piccadilly Circus, a toilet flush button on a train and a Russian public phone with his tongue as a testament to his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was getting into.
However, the experiment on which the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was made yielded interesting results.
The idea of licking a flush button on a train that thousands of other people have used may seem downright repulsive, but there are actually many more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Ian Wright spoke to doctors and healthcare professionals about strengthening gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left anything worse than a bad taste in his mouth.
Ian Wright is famous for testing the resilience of his gut while traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system safely, from public railings at train stations to flushing
In a film about it, he says, "Ever since I was a kid, I didn't care much about my health, and I put everything in my mouth, from dirt to eating worms and muddy water."
In the film, he certainly confirmed his reputation.
The only thing he refused was dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple swab, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
In comparison, freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
But he refused to lick one public toilet in Russia after his luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have fewer than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio made a traveller's film, The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in various places, such as the bathroom
In the film, he said, "This is pretty much the ugliest thing I've ever felt in the toilet."
There is nothing dirtier than this!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting here.
Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was made in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help strengthen the gut bacteria and immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio's senior vice president of snacks, juices and new categories, said: "We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that they would watch with interest and at the same time would allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We came up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended with the idea of "let's call Ian."
It is said that interest in gut health is becoming a worldwide phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a broader context — the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health, and how that is connected to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and through this document we have brought more detailed information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the film!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's put it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked something I wanted him to do – like the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film."
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, others pretty hard.
I'm glad we licked some of the dirty stuff."
Valio conducted a 2015 survey that found that 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and gut health, and 58 percent of respondents said they used products containing added lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
A family of needy people vandalised a municipal building in Saltash, Cornwall, before eviction
A needy family left £50,000 in damage to their council home after they were accused of terrorising their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forced eviction from the house, officials of the housing association were shocked to find that the property was in disrepair.
There were holes in the walls, the floor covering was torn, there was rubbish everywhere on the floor, and the walls were scrawled.
The family has now moved out and is believed to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned about whether the house could be saved.
She said: "It was a nightmare for the people here and I don't think people should live like this.
There are a number of circumstances to consider, as this property is likely to be known as a "not so nice part" of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and their names are infamous.
The couple have three sons who have stayed at the house from time to time, and police said the family's reign of terror included street fights using baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug distribution, and loud shouting, arguing and cursing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name appeared on the lease, was sentenced in June for antisocial behaviour.
Stinking garbage was found in several rooms in a house that may be demolished.
In the house where drugs were distributed in the past, the floor covering was torn out
Neighbors say they saw them fighting on the street, and people regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner this week after being given an additional 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
Neighbors who were relieved welcomed the eviction, saying their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone at all."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always like this.
How many times we have seen the police here cannot be counted at all.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was incredibly quiet here - we're not used to that!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, neighbourhood supervision manager at Cornwall Housing, said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were regularly called to the house
Garbage and old toys were lying around in an overgrown part of the municipal house
He adds: "It is a shame that the tenant has failed to take responsibility for her own behaviour and that of her family. Eviction is always the last step that Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very complex case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, must have frightened her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall Police and the members of the local community who bravely informed us.
I hope that this step will bring some comfort to the neighbors and at the same time carry with it the message that we will not tolerate unsocial behavior.
Fitzpatrick said the tenant's three sons, who lived in the house at various times, were in their early 20s.
A dirty mattress that remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after moving out
Workers will now have to remove piles of rubbish left around the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weight, equipment and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined when found guilty of possession of Class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed the money was intended for the foundations of a house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Tanya and her partner are believed to be living in private accommodation in Plymouth after moving out.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted with graffiti.
Police say they will seek eviction of tenants who violate the rules of their leases
Angela Crow, of Denovo and Cornwall Police, said the eviction was a clear message to other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity and to those who would like to follow such behavior," she said.
Denovo and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal terrified after low military jet flight over beach
Tourists enjoying the sun's rays in Aveiro, Portugal, were scared to death
The Portuguese Air Force's P-3C Orion aircraft flew incredibly low
The Air Force said it was a training flight and insisted there was no threat to safety
As the low-flying jet descended over the crowded beach, panic seized the frightened tourists.
Dramatic footage shows a military plane coming almost touch-to-touch from sunbathers on a sandy beach near the town of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to rise after being disturbed by the noise of jet engines, without seeing what would emerge from the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon on the Costa Nova near the town of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic flyover on social media, said: "The plane flew really low twice and at one point it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I really thought the plane was going to fall on my head."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when a plane flying low appeared out of the darkness
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to descend low because it was the only way to inspect the ships.
The plane reportedly flew slightly lower than normal due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the Air Force insists that people's safety has not been compromised.
Forest fires this summer destroyed part of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to thick fog and smoke from fires that obstructed his view
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats as part of the training.
Half of funeral services do not comply with regulations.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with the law.
The Czech Trade Inspection Authority (CTIA) found this out during inspections in the second quarter.
According to her, funeral services most often do not inform survivors about their prices or do not issue a written confirmation of receipt of the order.
The CTIA imposed 41 fines in the total value of CZK 73,000.
Its spokesman Jiří Fröhlich informed about it today.
Inspectors found errors in 47 out of 95 inspections.
In addition to the failure to inform about prices and the lack of receipts, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially uncertified measuring instrument.
The Inspectorate therefore banned the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7,077.
This concerned urn covers, candle covers and vases that were not properly labelled with the mandatory information.
"Given that violations of the law are still occurring in this specific area of services, the inspection will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
London schoolgirl who joined IS killed in Syria
It was reported that Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, has died in Syria.
Tasnime Akunjee's lawyer said the family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, several weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that she was likely killed during a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country.
Sultana was 17 and, according to her family, died just as she was preparing to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One wants to believe that the only good thing about this whole thing — as a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers associated with going to a war zone — is that it will deter people from ever making a decision," Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a flight to Turkey in February 2015 and then onto a bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultana family learned that they had married an IS fighter in Syria — and were widowed within months.
Reid says that if Clinton is elected, she will keep Garland as the Supreme Court nominee.
Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid says he is confident Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected.
Senate Republicans blocked Garland's appointment, even though President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the person to replace the late Supreme Court justice will be chosen by the future president.
Reid said during a conference call Thursday that he believes Clinton will select Garland "with some degree of credibility."
Reid's spokeswoman later said he had not spoken directly to Clinton about nominating Garland and that he had only speculated.
He praised Garland and said that Team Clinton would not want to "rock the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is president of the federal appeals court in Washington.
Reid said the Republicans blocking Garland's appointment are "henchmen" and "lackeys" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was unfit for office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars are for "both women and men."
Treats is working closely with photographer David Bellemer to release a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli's 70s calendar.
But instead of revealing celebrities, she's trying to find the next generation of top models for her 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nudity magazine is different from old-school Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
Evidently, he thinks the calendar as well.
"We need to get back to the depiction of timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by photographs of the female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar's release.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where is vinyl going: who really buys records?
Vinyl is loved by lonely middle-aged men.
Before you decide to flood the comments section with peppery comments under the pseudonym Not AllLoneMiddle-Aged Men, note that this statement is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurrection of records is linked not to the boom of millennials wanting to enjoy the originality of owning a physical object, but to the nostalgia of middle age.
Those who have recently bought an album on vinyl are most likely people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It's not really about accumulating an enthusiastic fan – there's an emotional dimension to the whole thing: older people who buy records are more likely to want to retain their feelings (56% versus 53%) and to be happy alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog had been broadcast as a television report, I would have been watched on camera as I drove out onto a busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent grey suit and gesticulating widely. Then I would stop, put my hands out and say something authoritative, like, "Let's take a look."
So let's take a look.
While Soho's charm and charm are slowly fading from its heart – buildings once occupied by independent retailers are now filled with hotels, restaurants and eateries, ready-to-wear and office supplies – a few fantastic specialist record shops remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while. I will stand close to the various men in these shops and try to observe their age and emotional state.
Stuart, 55, a Glasgow native, whom I follow from Sister Ray (count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has a meeting in London in the afternoon and looks at the shops to fill a few hours of time.
I ask him if he is a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
All these recordings line the walls of his living room - pictured above (he emailed me the photo, I didn't follow him all the way home).
He also has this huge number of albums and singles because he can afford it: he can now buy records that he couldn't afford when they were originally released, and he buys again what he sold in his youth and didn't have a penny.
"A lot of what I buy is from the late '60s and early '70s. It's stuff that would have been published when I was 11 or 12. Back then I was too small to get them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy the records are probably introverts who enjoy the company of themselves. He adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez, 25, works at Sister Ray and also thinks many of the customers he meets fit into YouGov's profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave. People who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy their old records back.
According to my interviews, people most often disposed of their collections between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their records and bought CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records back," he says.
This could explain the boom of record lovers of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to discover in a store like Phonica that you'll find a nice community of like-minded people in music stores.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly offended by the contactless payment system.
Some fans of gramophone records may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have opted for the familiar environment of record covers, things that evoke memories of peaceful adolescence.
"I think filling a gap or owning something tangible can bring some comfort," Wez says.
I'm a collector myself, it's the same for me, and I think a lot of people do too.
It's an easy way to fill a niche in your head.
"We're all like their social workers!" says a co-worker from a pile of records.
An ICM survey in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not yet listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of those surveyed have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy records do not have one.
At this point in the report, he probably looked seriously concerned as he went through the pile of bossa nova compilations.
The "trophy" aspect and the revival of interest is something that Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men), has noticed.
"Someone came in recently and said, 'I don't have a turntable yet, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on a shelf,'" he says.
The percentage of such is not large, but it happens.
It's more about the product side than the music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a gramophone."
These are younger people, not older, grown-up teenagers who are getting into it.
Fopp, where almost an entire floor is currently reserved for records, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
There are couples in their seventies, photo-takers, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere isn't as relaxed as the shops used to be – the speakers are filled with the latest Wild Beasts pop full of synthesizers and sex instead of pulling jazz, it's good to see the diverse customers.
None of them look particularly alone, but the intrusive mental trauma is hard to gauge when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) walks in Fopp for a few minutes, looking at various records on sale.
She is one of those who looks at shop windows rather than spending feverishly.
According to her words, she does not earn much, so there is no question that she would collect gramophone records.
It costs a lot of money.
It is easy to listen to music on computer or similar. But gramophone records have their charm...," he sighs longingly.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is the shop that supposedly inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend to be very intrigued by the calves of girls in tight jeans and watch a group of teenage girls who are just crowding around Polaroid cameras. Then father and daughter decide to buy a Crosley turntable.
On the left is a staircase with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average record collection.
No one looks at them - maybe because they are just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that you can't reach them.
It's a pure "vinyl gimmick".
But since any attraction to it could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho for more, there's not much to complain about.
It's no surprise that the demographic area, where more time and money is likely than other areas, is also the one where the most luxurious, such as vinyl, is likely to be spended.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's results are accurate — at least in record stores, they don't take into account the large number of vinyl collectors and lovers who actually exist in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard in schools or offices.
He certainly doesn't spend Thursday mornings wandering around the record shops of Berwick Street, going through tapes and avoiding the sight of a strange, thirty-year-old fake TV presenter hiding behind the backs of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies the sharks, says the recording shows a female estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters tall
Court in France refuses to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A court in France has rejected an order by authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, home to thousands of refugees.
During a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be allowed to close a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, sell tea for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The office of the prefect of Calais argued that the sites needed to be demolished because they were a parallel economy that did not pay taxes and because they posed fire hazards and health risks.
Aid agencies told the court that shops and restaurants were vital and that the free meals offered by the state-backed association and other groups did not provide food supplements for the growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Questionable makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis preventing people from running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the prefect Calais' objections were "entirely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said grocery stores, cafes and restaurants have a much bigger role than simply serving food to people who "live in extremely desperate conditions."
He said the premises provide quiet places for refugees and volunteers to meet.
One of the sites threatened with demolition was a café in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, run by a non-profit organization, which offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and asylum counseling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
A petition to protect the "children's" café was signed by more than 170,000 people.
The Guardian received a letter saying closing the café "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are as young as 8 years old."
The charity Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the camp had risen to more than 9,000 after a steep rise in arrivals over the summer — the highest ever.
He thought he was dead.
Ulč resurrects itself and volleyball Ústí.
"Since March, I have been able to train normally," he reported at the start of summer training at full strength.
What happened to you?
I had a bilateral pulmonary embolism, then heart problems because of it.
Because when I was at the Universiade in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble was caused by a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my calf for two years and I didn't know about it.
It hurt me, no one found me anything.
Then the clot got up.
There is a damaged vein in the calf, it will hurt all the time, especially when it is working or the weather changes.
But nothing that would limit me, more of an aesthetic thing.
Were you afraid for your life?
Had.
Last year at the summer tournament in Dřevěnice, I didn't know I had an embolism, and I couldn't move there at all.
In the evening I vomited blood.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, I was completely done for another five days.
I really thought I was dead in Dřevěnice, and so was my girlfriend and family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with that?
I probably had to experience it, now it will only go up.
I know that I have some problems with my blood, that I have to watch myself more when I fly somewhere.
But everything can be done about it.
Only when I wanted to return to the preparation of Příbram last year, there were still problems with my heart.
Now everything is fine.
Since March, I've been preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I knock it off, physically I'm better off than before.
What do you expect from Ústí nad Labem?
I'm looking forward to it, the group looks good, I know most of the guys.
I am curious about the other two foreigners who will come.
Hopefully we'll sit down humanly so that it fits together.
Will you lift the estuary?
It had a reputation as a batterer, but every season is different.
Brno two years ago was eighth, now it finished second.
There is a new team in Ústí nad Labem, only a few players remain.
It was the last one in the Premier League, so there is a lot of room for improvement.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see after the first rounds who will be battered, hopefully not.
Is Coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He is already experienced and has experienced a lot, he will think of a better than last place.
But my arrival had nothing to do with his, I had agreed earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, I'm great friends with one of them and it was agreed that he would work here.
I won't say the name.
Finally, Mr Brom came, and I am glad.
He's got a big name, he's been to good clubs, he's been coaching for many decades, he's a good former player.
It will move us up.
What will you bring?
This team is going to fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to cheer and I like to get an opportunity in a not so top team.
I was in Příbram for two years, but Ústí is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team, because you start from the bottom.
You mentioned foreigners, Australian Boehm is already training in Ústí nad Labem.
What does it look like?
I happen to know him, at the Universiade we played against each other in a group.
And we talked a few times there, sometimes we sat together in the evening after games, so we already know each other as friends.
We beat them 3: 1, I immediately gave him a shot at the start of the summer training in Ústí nad Labem.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he's a nice guy.
American Nadazdin and Brazilian Ze will also arrive.
Do you know anything about them?
I corresponded with an American, he looks like a nice guy, a Brazilian who knows how he will speak English.
Did you contact the American?
It seemed like a good idea to me.
I am a recorder, that is, the one who creates, so I should communicate with everyone.
I immediately found out what kind of player he was, I found on the internet how he plays, I saw some videos.
He seemed quite fine, the boy jumps, he is tall.
We texted each other on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he would fit in with us.
How are you looking forward to being the number one record player?
I didn't want to take anything else.
After all, I'll be twenty-four, and I don't have the temperament to take turns.
I'd rather be in the center of the action, I'd rather be in charge of the team than have someone else lead it.
I probably wouldn't want to play anymore if I had to be a second record player and devote myself to it full time. If something is not done to the fullest, it sucks.
How many times have you been number one?
Half a year in Příbram, when it didn't work out for Kusta as captain, he got injured, then there were problems with money and he left.
From then on we went up and I played all the time.
In Brno, where I am a pupil, I alternated between one and two.
An excellent year was in Staré Město, after which I had a lot of offers and chose Příbram.
Budějovice wanted me from there, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short positioning remains Phelps' domain.
"To be on the podium again and hear the anthem is sweet as ever," Phelps laughed, his eyes full of tears again.
His fiancée and mother were cheering in the audience again, this time his son Boomer slept peacefully with headphones on.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started swimming competitively and in a few hours it will all be over, he said movingly.
In the final, Phelps was almost two seconds behind the silver medalist Kosuke Hagino, who won the long position.
The bronze went to China's Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's World Championships.
After Al Oerter (discus) and Carl Lewis (distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to dominate the same discipline at four consecutive Games.
For most of the race, fellow American Ryan Lochte and home Thiago Perreira held the lead with Phelps.
While the defending champion put on a crushing finish in the final freestyle fifty, they fell out of the medal positions.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance to expand his unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the ceremony of the position, he advanced to the final of the 100-meter butterfly.
The legend could not be overshadowed even by compatriot Ryan Murphy, who won a backstroke double - after a hundred he won a double track in Rio.
In the final, he left Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin behind by 37 hundredths, Russian Evgeny Rylov finished third.
While Murphy has only fifth place out of two hundred from last year's World Championships, in Rio he became the king of signs.
He dethroned Larkin, who managed the same double at last year's World Championships.
But he only won a medal at the Olympics now.
Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel shared the gold in the freestyle hundred.
For sixteen-year-old Oleksiak it was the fourth medal at these Games, for Manuelova the second after silver in the relay.
She won swimming gold at the Olympics as the first African-American woman in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
"This medal is for all those who come after me, sport will become love for them and they will get to where I do," said an emotional Manuel.
The third was the Swede Sarah Sjöström, who won the 100-meter butterfly in Rio in a world record and still has a silver in the freestyle two-hundred.
World record holder Cate Campbell of Australia finished sixth.
The breaststroke two-hundred was won by the Japanese Rie Kanetová, for whom it is the first Olympic medal at the age of twenty-seven.
She has no precious metal from the World Championships, her maximum was fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio went to Russian Yuliya Yefimova, who despite her doping past has faced hostility from spectators and opponents due to her start at the Games.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should keep answering these questions.
I'm terribly tired of it, said the Russian swimmer.
She won the right to start in Rio at a special panel of the CAS arbitration for sport just before the start of the Games.
They dealt with my appeal and I won.
If anyone likes it or not, or has a different opinion, they should go to the arbitration court, she added.
Hermann: Disappointing, we could have won.
And the start at midnight?
I don't remember that.
The Czech women experienced a special day.
It wasn't until less than an hour before the game that they found out who they would play against.
They had to master tactical preparation in a flash.
And then, at an unconventional time, the match began on the small court number 1.
They did not start the first set well, then they closed the gap of their opponents, but at 19:19 they did not manage the endgame.
In the second, they were clearly better and leveled, but the decisive tie-break did not work out.
Above all, a number of broken services meant a 10:15 loss and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have beaten the Russians," Hermann regretted.
How would you evaluate the match?
Hermannová: After an unfortunate start, before I warmed up, we got into the game beautifully.
In the endgame, in the last balloon, I missed the reception to which I had previously become accustomed.
We lost a set, which was key.
In the next set we started them with an overview on the court, a different defense and we pushed on the service.
In the tie-break there were terribly spoiled serves, there we lost this aspect.
It was disappointing because we could have beaten the Russians.
Sluková: It's a pity at the beginning of the first set, we missed it.
We were able to pull it off, but we missed the points.
The second set was great and in the third it was the service that decided.
We made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points and that was five points, we hesitated a lot.
It's a shame, because the Russians were playable.
How did you play on the small court No. 1?
Sluková: Similar to China on the side courts.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
It was one o'clock at night, complete silence, there was no music, nothing anywhere.
That was the difference from the center.
We would not choose such conditions, but we cannot choose.
How was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of your opponents an hour before the match?
Hermann: It was strange.
We started to warm up for the game without knowing the opponents, so we couldn't do the tactical preparation like the other teams.
But Simon (coach Nausch) prepared tactics for almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of tactical papers ready, so we were pretty well prepared in that respect.
Do you remember ever starting a game at midnight?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played at half past eleven, but not at twelve.
Block of Russian Birlova in the preliminary round of the play-off at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermannová embraced in the preliminary round of the play-off at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Was it uncomfortable?
Sluková: Since we have played the last two matches in a group of ten, we had already shifted the regime earlier.
This was two more hours.
It's strange, I can't imagine that any other sport has athletes who have to give their best performance at twelve o'clock.
But I think we prepared the best we could.
We knew it would be like that, but it's not typical and probably won't be my favorite time to play.
How do you rate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since advancing from the group was our goal, on the one hand it's okay, good.
We did what we told each other.
But now after the game I'm sad.
Sluková: I will sleep through it and from tomorrow I will remember the Olympic tournament only positively.
Big Brother is here, the first surveillance SIM is coming.
You won't escape it.
The new rules will apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to purchase a SIM card from a local operator while staying in Thailand.
That is, not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas who, for example, work in Thailand or have married there.
Takorn Tantasith, secretary general of the Office of National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, has said there will be no exceptions.
The plan to sell SIM cards intended exclusively for foreigners was presented by the national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
The new measure, which will allow them to be tracked, is planned to be implemented within six months.
According to Tantasith, this is a means of preserving national security that will make it possible to deal with crimes committed by foreigners.
In addition, so-called tourist SIM cards are intended to help detect people who exceed the permitted length of stay.
Within six months, special SIM cards for foreigners should appear alongside SIM cards intended exclusively for Thais.
The difference will be the tracking function, which will be permanently turned on for cards intended for people without a Thai passport.
You won't be able to turn it off.
"This is not the case with SIM cards for Thais because we can always easily track them," Tantasith added.
It should be noted that in Thailand prepaid is not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators gave out free starter SIM cards to tourists at airports.
They were fully anonymous.
Ten telecoms regulators from other Asian countries, including Malaysia and Singapore, are considering introducing the same measure as Thailand.
There is currently a mandatory SIM registration in these countries, but legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the planned measure does not mean an obligation for foreigners to purchase a SIM card from a local operator when entering the country.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
The operators of a given country only know the relevant network information when they cross the border, that is to say, when the SIM has logged on to their network.
So they know the phone number, but not the owner's information.
However, the difference in roaming prices compared to local operators is so abysmal that even most tourists start looking for local SIM cards during their stay in Thailand.
The authorities' efforts to supervise the movement of foreigners have been met with immediate criticism by foreigners legally living in Thailand.
Tantasith calms the situation and compares the planned system to the obligation to provide a residential address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a warrant to track a specific person.
Any abuse of the system will be punished by an unspecified penalty.
"If a service provider tracks the location of a SIM without a warrant, it will be charged with a crime," Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should maximise the use of prepaid cards.
While at present, a specific number will be recycled only after a 90-day period after which the SIM has not logged in to the network, the number could be renewed after fifteen days if leaving Thailand.
Luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a whirlpool on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment where most of the care of the property is taken care of by the manager.
The condition was sufficient parking spaces and an elevator in the house, which basically disqualified the older buildings.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with rocking the floor, high energy demands and the like.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old buildings are not able to offer.
Other interesting visits can be found in the magazine Moderní byt.
The entire interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langerová and her colleague Kamila Poláková from the Artiga studio.
Why did you approach them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to anyone?
We would recommend cooperation with an architect to anyone if they design an apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second level is the interior design itself: designers have a much better idea of the range of possible materials and, based on the client's wishes, are able to match the interior appropriately.
We had already cooperated with architect Lenka Langerová on our mountain apartment, at that time on the basis of a personal recommendation from another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us during the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social and living space with adequate facilities for a family of four, conceived as a modern, but not cold interior.
The priority was to achieve the interconnection of the apartment with the terraces and to implement intelligent home control.
And, of course, it was necessary to monitor the quality of the workmanship.
Did you leave everything to the experts, or did you yourself interfere with the final form of the interior?
We approved all designs, including technical drawings and samples of materials, but the design always came from architects.
At the beginning, we set out what we expect from the design and showed some of the interior elements that we would like to incorporate into the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think that our collection of mostly Czech authors, including works by Karel Malich, Karel Vysušil, Václav Špála and Otto Gutfreund, helped the architect to orientate herself in our tastes.
Also, the combination of black, white and walnut wood was the architect's idea as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. We then jointly verified whether everything fits together using visualizations.
Were there any complications during the implementation that forced you to give up the original ideas or, on the contrary, accept new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the construction site at the moment when it was first possible to climb to the height of our floor, and found that the views we had planned were actually shading the surrounding buildings.
At that time, we fundamentally changed the layout literally overnight.
Granite was used on the kitchen counter and on the paneling of the fireplace wall.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces complemented by leather, for example on the upholstery of Norma dining and bar stools from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you planning any changes here or is there something you wish you had differently today?
I believe that it is a modern, airy interior that primarily fulfills its purpose.
We are not planning any changes, most of the modifications after moving in took place in the level of shading and occupation of terraces.
Perhaps the only criticism is the floor, when walnut wood turns out to be too delicate in a household with a dog.
A word from the architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, authors of the realization.
The apartment is on the top floor of a new building, so it was possible to make a completely new layout and several other modifications within the building.
For the interior, an important element is the placement of light guides in the ceiling of the corridor and the main toilet.
This gave us daylight into the darker areas of the apartment.
Also, direct access from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the USSPA pool is one of the building modifications that was very beneficial for the function of the entire apartment.
It also features a swimming pool and a hot tub.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, says a Muslim woman living in Prague.
You come from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are originally from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, not far from the Spanish border.
I moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France, which led me to work for a magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was beginning to feel like I was suffocating in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mainly because of the atmosphere among people.
It seemed to me that every Frenchman is terribly negative.
People in France are generally negative, but it's gotten worse lately.
It's interesting that you mention negativism.
Some people evaluate the Czech character in this way.
Believe me, you are not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not think so when they come to France, because they don't perceive it as tourists.
But for me it was too much.
Money, for example, is a big topic.
People feel that they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there is also the problem of people's behavior towards Muslims.
This is completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor started looking down on me just because I was a Muslim.
As if I were some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel comfortable in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job basically anywhere else and I came across a vacancy at Air France here in Prague.
I admit that I didn't know Prague at all at first.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years now and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Mainly because of the completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't catch any negative reactions or swearing, but I feel that people are freer here.
That I can do anything, dress any way, and no one will judge me.
In France, you are always looked at unpleasantly, for example, when you have special clothes and so on.
In Prague I started to feel really free.
I don't think the people of Prague care about such things.
Where do you work now?
After working at Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
Then another friend and I started a website where people offer and search for shared housing.
So far we operate only in Prague, but we would like to extend it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here, who are half Czech, and two Czech friends.
I have to say that another specificity of Czechs is that they initially keep more distance.
They don't let someone near their body right away.
That's quite different from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses each other on the cheek.
It's different here, but I understand that it's a cultural thing, so I try to adapt.
You mentioned that you don't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, it is quite easy for me in Prague, because almost everyone here speaks English.
Even in convenience stores or grocery stores.
I would like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And since everyone can communicate at least a little in English, I don't have such a need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there is someone to help me.
Have you encountered any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a Muslim?
Not really.
Maybe it's also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience comes to mind.
My manager, a Czech, once told me about a French football team and said something like this: They are not French, but Africans.
That touched me quite a bit.
But that anyone would have a problem with me being a Muslim, that has not happened to me yet.
This is despite the fact that a colleague once warned me about some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go to the center, that they would scold me there.
The anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly linked to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something similar to Paris, Nice or Brussels could happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is that nowadays anything can happen anywhere.
Until recently, I could not imagine that something like this would happen in France.
And it's not just Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognize violence at all.
To me, people who kill are not Muslims.
The Qur'an says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel about terrorists shielding themselves with your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to follow the violence reports too much, but every time I read something, I feel the need to apologize for something that isn't really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met on Jiřího z Poděbrad Square.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims and Christians demonstrated against the violence.
Did you notice it?
I didn't know about that.
But my understanding is that these people feel the need to prove that they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they need to do something like that.
Why should they feel guilty about something they didn't cause?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
For example, my co-workers are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They are a bit more religious than I am, so we sometimes have quite wild discussions about Islam because we all perceive it a little differently.
I come from France, so I went through a different education, for example, they learned Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordination of women.
How do you see it?
I don't feel subordinate in any way.
Quite the opposite.
I am a woman, I have strength.
This is also related to the fact that you do not wear any headgear.
For example, the hijab?
And it's mainly due to the way I was raised.
My mother, for example, is a really principled Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he just doesn't wear a headscarf.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It is up to everyone how they interpret it.
When one reads the Qur'an, one should form one's own opinion on these things.
So when I read a passage in the Qur'an that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself: I am not the wife of the Prophet, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect it, and when I travel to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where headscarves are required, I take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
Nowhere else did I feel so good.
I thought about Poland for a while, but I feel great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
In my opinion, Prague is the ideal city for this.
Czech Muslims together with Christians demonstrated against violence.
Yachtswoman Kozelská Fenclová was blown to the advancing positions in Rio.
Friday's sea rides in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, went well for Czech yachtswoman Veronika Kozelská Fenclová.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved up to tenth place before the final two heats.
This would ensure the Czech's participation in the final run.
You collect packs as Pokémon.
They want to compete with carriers.
The idea to use the already planned routes for the transport of consignments is the work of television director Matěj Liška and the manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
With the idea, they breathed life into a trio of apps with different geographic reach.
We launched the domestic application Převezu in May.
At the moment, there are a thousand cities uploaded in it and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn it first before we focus more on foreign countries, says the forty-one-year-old manager in an interview for iDNES.cz.
How does the Prevezu app work and who can benefit from it?
Download it and register for free.
You can then enter the route and details of how big a package you can carry and how much you want for it.
Someone may be asking for a transport that day.
When the route and delivery time are suitable, it is paired and both receive a mutual notification.
At that moment, a chat will open, where the pair will arrange a handover.
How many people do you think would have to register to always find a courier for each package?
I do not know the ideal state, I can not estimate how many registered and how many trips are needed to ensure that the coverage is completely optimal and each offer is matched with the demand.
On the main roads it already works and it is logically easier than on the way between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
Meanwhile, people are also building trust and finding out that no one can run away with the package.
Have you not had to deal with such a case yet?
How many users does the service have after two months of launch?
Right now, we have about 5,000 to 6,000 people creating paths.
We consider this a success and we believe that more will be added.
Isn't there a risk that the sender will wait too long?
We hope to compete with large conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the same day and for a fraction of the price.
For a large company, you will pay several thousand for delivery within two hours.
Here you will pay a hundred or less, because it is a journey that someone is already taking.
Should traditional carriers be worried about a possible loss of customers in the future?
We hope so.
The market has a huge potential, huge multinational carriers are fed here, as well as retail chains, where everyone started to buy and gradually found out that the quality does not correspond to what they pay for.
No one wants to find a note in the mailbox with a message to pick up the shipment at a branch, no earlier than the day after 7 p.m.
By that time, I had needed the package for six hours and was waiting at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that will not annoy anyone and will send a signal to the competition to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
Neither has ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a manager of a music club, Matěj Liška as a television director.
In 2014, they started preparing the Shippansee LTD application, which uses already planned trips between world capitals, especially by plane, to transport packages.
In 2015, they commissioned a company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming took three quarters of a year and the application was launched on the market in March 2016.
They started developing the Převezu application in December last year and released it in May this year.
It is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
Profi has been developing the Messel and Moonstick applications since January this year and made it available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention from the beginning was to make all these applications that will one day merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
The sharing economy has been a topic lately, and this is a service like AirBnB or Uber.
Aren't you worried about operating in an area about which no one can say much yet, where the boundary of sharing and where the shadow economy is?
It's the same, just a different product.
We know that if it succeeds and we go up with it, we will be another thorn in the side through the shadow economy.
But even if someone saves and someone earns, it is not the intention to circumvent tax offices and tax inspections.
Every user, on one side or the other, will be encouraged to tax their income if they make income out of it.
Why do you think the service has such great potential?
The sender saves and the transporter earns, respectively reduces the cost of the trip.
This is the powerful idea that unites interest on both sides.
In the age of social networks that divide people, we would like this one to bring people closer together.
Nice stories can be created, people are happy that they helped someone and they will talk about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
In my opinion, people have been missing a personal approach for a long time, we say about this application that it is a service of people to people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier will not flee with the package?
Each user of the application scans their ID card together with the registration and provides their bank details, payment or credit card.
These are the channels that give credibility to both service and man.
Couriers also collect stars based on senders' ratings.
We will also offer insurance, we are still fine-tuning the details.
In the event of loss or damage, the courier is liable for an uninsured shipment, but does not assume responsibility for the contents under criminal law if there is something illegal inside and he does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find a submachine gun or ten kilos of hashish in a sealed package in his suitcase, he falls on the criminal responsibility of the sender.
Is there a risk of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
If necessary, the registered are traceable by the administrative authority, which will be the only one able to see it, nor are we able to see them ourselves, the data is protected against misuse.
How much money will the courier get after successful delivery of the shipment?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he asks for.
The sender will be charged an extra few percent for providing contact.
This money is our profit, but it is only a few percent, because we want to push the volume.
Also, no one can accuse the courier of not delivering the parcel when he actually delivered it, the receipt and delivery is verified using QR codes.
Are there any limitations?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can transport anything.
We have three sizes, small as a cube of butter, medium as a plate of eggs, and large as a bass of beers.
After that, there is no further restriction and if someone has space in the car, he can transport a refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the application, so the courier can see what is wanted from him.
You don't even have to pack the item if you don't really want to hide the content.
You put the forgotten sweatshirt in the courier's hand and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to launch the service?
A friend of mine got the idea more than two years ago, I didn't pay much attention to it at the time.
Then he showed me a demo app with transnational reach that mainly targets air passengers.
At that moment, I told him that I would not look for an investor, but I would like to become one myself and put my savings into it.
It took another year of development before we founded Shippansee LTD in London due to the greater credibility of the whole product.
But this is not the version you are focusing on now.
No, we focused our marketing on the Czech Republic, where we are trying to improve the application, because the whole thing had birth pains and there is still room for improvement and resolution.
We try to respond to customer feedback and we do not deal with the foreign market so much at the moment.
We know it's a long run, but we're not in a hurry, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were upgrades in their own way.
I was born when we said that the domestic segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application of Mesíkem is local, for the city.
But it can send a package to the exact address and to the other side of the world.
It works for senders in the same way as Převezu, but the difference is that as a courier you can see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in your mobile.
We called the application for couriers who want to make a living from it Měsík Profi.
So someone can earn extra money by picking up packages around the city?
Exactly, the last application is downloaded in Prague by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make the most of the trip to work.
As everyone is fooling around with those Pokémon now, they can collect this just as well.
You see where the orders are around the city, you come to it, click and see when it has to be delivered and take the shipment away.
It's set up cheaper than competing services.
At the moment, we are still making a web interface that will be crucial for companies to send shipments, they will fill in the data on the web, so they will create points on the map.
We are then able to invoice them for the use of the service every month.
Are you now working full-time on the project?
It exhausts us, but we normally have it at work so that we can feed and develop the project.
We are not hiding a strong multinational investor, we are two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped in with other suggestions and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to manage not the Czech market with us, but who should go with us to a global product and become another huge player on the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The story part of Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring almost forgotten variety.
This will be corrected by the second part, and the solo game in it, according to the first information, will be more varied than in Call of Duty.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the content should be based on the concept of network competition in the first part.
Therefore, you can look forward to freedom of movement, which in addition to running also includes the possibility of using a combat titan.
In addition to action passages, the game will also include levels focused on dexterous movement.
They will resemble platformers and include puzzles.
For example, double jumps, running on walls and a rope slide are essential to overcome them.
In addition, sometimes it will be necessary to eliminate enemies.
There will also be maps resembling mazes and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to raise and slide platforms and close massive doors.
You will adjust the shape of the battlefield.
As a result, the pace of the game should oscillate between furious action and quieter moments for exploring an unknown planet.
We will play as a pawn Jack Cooper dreaming of a career as a pilot.
At the beginning of the campaign, Cooper and Captain Lastimosa are shipwrecked on the alien planet Typhon, which is inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And neither will the local wilderness.
In addition, Lastimosa is mortally wounded in the crash, and Cooper is tasked with activating the captain's titan.
His dream of a career as a pilot will come true sooner than he expected.
But the first step will be to steal the battery necessary for the robot's repair.
Cooper's conversations with the titan will also be significant.
It will serve as a source of information about the soldier's past, but at the same time the robot's depersonalized communication will create humorous moments.
For example, if titanium will dryly list all the injuries that Cooper faces during a planned jump.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 was brought by Polygon.
In addition, the result will be judged in two months, and Bonusweb will give you your first impressions of the network game after gamescom.
Titanfall 2 launches on October 28 for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
The THQ brand comes to life, but the original label remains dead.
Swedish company Nordic changes its name to THQ Nordic.
After the bankruptcy of THQ in 2013, it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the company's logo and name.
Nordic has released Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and the Red Faction Collection.
In addition, another 23 games are being created for the publisher, 13 of which the company has not yet revealed.
Thirty years ago, when I retired, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a man twenty years younger, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - at first she had obviously been trying for a long time, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she used to date a similar one before me.
She was completely crazy about him.
In those first days, her voice even changed, she had this girlish, amorous voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I watched the whole thing.
Back then he regularly came home from work at half past four, so she always left at three to go shopping.
Every day she tried to at least see him.
Later I found out that they were meeting in his house, in the laundry.
How many times I knew they were there.
I got my keys, determined to catch them there.
But I don't know why, in the end I always stayed at home.
I was never able to go there, to take that decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife controlled my mind.
I think she soon found out that I was controllable, that I would do what she wanted.
And I did.
Maybe I'm just a slipper.
At the same time, the neighbors indicated to me that she also knew about it.
I was such a fool that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all broke, it would be bad.
Only my daughter knew that it would affect everyone in the family.
So I always put it off, on and on.
But one day I went to his apartment and said I needed help with something in the laundry room.
He went there with me and I told him that I had received an anonymous message, that he was meeting my wife and that everything seemed to indicate this.
I asked him what he had to say.
He stood there, shrugging his shoulders, staring at the ground, and not saying a word.
Then, at that time, I met his wife on the way home from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't react to it and didn't tell me anything.
Nobody told me anything at the time.
I'm the kind of person who has never really gone anywhere, who has trouble getting to know someone, let alone finding a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I kept counting on it to end one day.
I told myself that I would forgive her all this and life would go on.
But that was not the case.
And I basically never came to terms with it all.
I still have it in me to this day.
I used to let her know it quite often, but in the end I gave it up for peace of mind.
He continues to live in the house next door and I continue to live with her.
Only she is more than my wife my housekeeper.
At home, she always did everything - cooked, washed, cleaned.
She is hardworking.
I think she always tried to make sure I had no other reason to complain.
And you can say that she is also good.
But sometimes I would like to stroke her, hug her, and she will not let go.
We go for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks what a happy marriage we have.
But she once told me that she never loved me.
That she loved me, but that she didn't love me.
And I see that she loves him to this day, he is her god.
And I don't enjoy such a life.
Even when it started and I took it very badly, I once told her that I didn't want to live and asked her what she would say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she would agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: Yes or no.
But she thought about it and finally said, "But there is plenty of room here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
After the terrorist attacks, France is stepping up its fight against radical Islamists, calling on the government and the local Muslim minority to help.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee their freedom of religion," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
He intends to ensure that only the spiritually educated in France preach in the country.
He also wants to stop the financing of mosques from abroad, where preachers indoctrinated with jihad often come with the money.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then-Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Even then, it was supposed to contribute to making the financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction more transparent.
Soon, however, internal contradictions hit it and it never functioned properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
The new foundation is likely to be headed by former Interior and Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as a champion of the secular state.
There are about 2500 mosques and places of worship in France, about 120 of which serve radical Islamism.
Since 2012, French authorities have expelled some 80 Islamic clerics from the country and are considering several dozen more.
This week, German police also cracked down on jihadist clerics.
The imams reportedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a space where worshippers allegedly became radicalized and later attacked a Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate erupted in France about a new institution to replace the defunct foundation.
Everything was precipitated by other terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks – to ensure domestic funding for mosques and to supervise imams.
However, it is not yet clear where it will get funding, although several proposals are under consideration.
One of them is a special levy on halal foods, i.e. mainly meat derived from slaughter according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by halal food vendors for granting permits.
Part of the money would then go to the foundation's budget.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 of them set out from France on a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
Moreover, only preachers who have undergone educational programs at their universities should work in French mosques.
Because of this, their preaching should be in harmony with democracy.
The government is also closing radical mosques.
"We have closed twenty since December and more will follow," Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.
"There is no place in France for those who preach hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
An unknown gunman seriously wounded his ex-wife on Friday morning at a shopping centre in the northern Spanish city of Zaragoza, the Independent reports.
The shooting occurred after the woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in a car outside a shopping mall, from where he also opened fire.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun on himself, the Independent reports.
The woman was taken to hospital by her uninjured daughter, and an ambulance had to arrive for the man in critical condition.
The crime took place around 11:00 a.m. in the central part of the capital of the autonomous region of Aragon, near the local university.
Citing the Spanish news agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably the couple's unresolved recent divorce.
Rolls with asparagus, wakame seaweed, ginger and chilli sauce.
Summer favors light, easily digestible meals, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our tastes and our heads.
And so the summer gardens smell grilled pork neck, pork belly, pork knuckle.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too light, still occasionally except for salad or roasted vegetables.
True, grilling is economical for time and dishes, plus it is a social affair and no one has to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to make good delicacies that make dining special, their preparation is a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to boil, bake, fry or stew anything for a long time.
And on top of that, they will contribute to our health.
Whether it's homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and a few well-learned griffins are enough to make the preparation fun and the food itself a real exotic delicacy.
As well as even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
Here, there is even no more time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice.
The paper can only be softened into water for a moment and then it depends only on the chef's imagination how he intends to play with fillings and accessories.
There is no algae like algae.
The advantage of many dishes of Asian cuisine today is that the ingredients are usually already commonly available.
Including pickled sweet and sour ginger, which is one of the basic delicacies accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can prepare it at home, but real pink gari ginger has a unique spicy sharp and delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe that is used to mix several types of vinegar and ginger.
Just buy a bag of the appropriate size, and the side dish with proven antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are mainly used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures to serve and decorate food on various festive occasions and rituals.
Long ribbed banana leaves are very widespread in many countries of Asia or South America also as an "aid" for the preparation of various baked, cooked and fried foods, which are packed in them similarly to aluminum foil.
The banana leaf then imparts a specific flavor to the food.
With us you can buy in stores with exotic fruits and vegetables, even pre-cut into the shape of wheels.
However, choose only leaves rich green, and therefore healthy - not cracked and without stains.
Similarly easy is the preparation of a salad from wakame seaweed, sesame and sesame oil.
It can be bought frozen again.
Who often eats or prepares sushi, probably knows especially kelp nori.
In Japan, it is one of the most important types of seaweed, from which the so-called nori leaves - sheets intended for the production of sushi - are made by chopping, pressing and drying.
Wakame – a dark green algae growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaido – is also eaten fresh and dried, and is as popular as nori.
By the way, who would not know miso soup with wakame, allegedly Asian women have been using it since ancient times for recovery after childbirth.
And in general, this algae has effects almost miraculous.
It purifies the blood, strengthens blood circulation, even allegedly prevents graying of hair and is literally loaded with minerals.
Dried and crushed wakame is also used as a seasoning, for example to flavor rice.
Fresh algae are first left to infuse in water, then rinsed, put in boiling water and boiled for half a minute.
Then they are cooled in ice water, the central rib is cut out and further prepared, perhaps as a popular salad.
However, buying it ready-made, frozen, is the easiest solution.
So all that remains is to roll a roll with an easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a longevity bomb.
If you resist and do not throw in an extra grilled pork belly.
Eat healthy, light and summery.
Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a little skill, and you have an interesting fresh dish that deliciously combines flavors.
And it's done in no time.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of carrots, 40 g of white radish, 100 g of green asparagus, 60 g of cucumber salad, 60 g of wakame seaweed and 60 g of sweet chili sauce.
A handful of chopped coriander, a teaspoon of black sesame, a teaspoon of sriracha chilli sauce, 20 g of mango and 40 g of pickled gari ginger, a little pine nuts.
First, prepare the rolls.
Soak rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we remove it and wait for it to soften.
Meanwhile, boil the asparagus sprouts briefly in hot water, after about three minutes let them cool quickly in ice water so that they do not lose color.
We put the filling from vegetables on the allowed paper and wrap.
Prepare the filling from white radish, carrot and cucumber, cut into fine strips, mix them with sweet chilli sauce, add chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and put on rice paper.
Put asparagus shoots on a banana leaf, add rolls and finally decorate the whole dish with wakame seaweed, pickled ginger, mango slice, sprinkle with black sesame and add a few pine nuts.
Britain has to settle for silver in rugby sevens, Fiji takes gold
Great Britain's impressive performance in sevens rugby ended with a devastating stop at the final hurdle, with Fiji beating the British 43-7 in the final match on Thursday night at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
The Fijans taught a masterclass in processing, dumping, dodge, support play, line running and brute force – and won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with a fresh consolation prize in the form of a silver medal - Britain's third of the day - and the British could be proud of their performances in the inaugural Olympic Rugby Sevens tournament, beating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A hard-earned 7-5 win over the South Africans in the semi-finals on the same day may have frustrated them in the final.
However, Fiji would beat a 15-man team in full health in their form.
It won't be a consolation for the British, but they can rejoice that at least one of them will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: the head coach of the Fijans is Ben Ryan, the former England boss at Wimbledon.
Great Britain has come a long way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost the only one.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji started spectacularly, the intrusions of the British repelled for joy.
For captain Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like running behind a line of buses in motion, and the World Cup champions were leading 5-0 when Osea Kolinasau emerged from around the corner.
The clock showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right flank from which it was a conversion.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The great Mitchel tried to stop the huge Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring a third time, but only slowed the Fijans down.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua threw a touchdown into the right corner to give the British a 17-0 loss.
Nakarawa added another on his return and there was still more than 1 minute left on the clock... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then penetrated the languid Britons and rushed to the line where he scored.
The conversion to 29-0 was followed by a break.
It was as if Fiji was born for Rugby 7s while the British were still learning to pass on.
That's just the way it is.
The British made mass changes after half-time and stopped the Fijan onslaught... for a long four minutes, which compared to the first half was good, until Josuo Tuisova penetrated after Fiji's brilliant interlude.
Dan Norton tried to create an opportunity for the British, throwing a touchdown into the left corner to increase an 36-7. But the match had long since been won by the inhabitants of the Pacific islands, and their fans were singing, waving flags and dancing in the stands.
It was hard not to admire the utterly joyful attitude of the Fijanians.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame sweetened the victory of the Fijans with another attempt.
The whistle sounded, the Fijans embraced, and the British fell on the lawn, completely overwhelmed.
Earlier that day, Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals, and Great Britain beat South Africa in a close semi-final – by a margin of one conversion.
Kyle Brown gave the South Africans the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton's dazzling footwork broke through the defensive line and scored under the hook in the second half.
A brilliant late dump by Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of Team England's fifteen, secured victory - and ultimately a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning were inspired to win the rowing race by a coach's battle with cancer
You won't find more emotional gold at these Games – and that's what to say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 punishing breaths into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found further meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio de Lagoa.
Although there were two at the oars, there were three voices in the boat. As the boat whizzed across the surface towards a second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's pairs race, the voice of ever-present coach Robin Williams was still in the boat with them. They are the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such a result.
Their superiority was absolute, it was their 39th race overall in which they remained unbeaten.
What we see - two outstanding female athletes flying across the water with the elegance of a swan - does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
Behind every rowing gold medal is a battalion of helping hands that make the difference, bit by bit. And no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who, 30 months ago, didn't know if he would live to see that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was uncertain.
I suffered from bladder cancer, which can be operated on, and I had this operation.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It will change your perspective somewhat.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
It was fortunate for the trio that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, in the off-season, and shorten the outage to a minimum - if we can call it that in such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get myself back together quickly.
That was the impetus.
I was in the hospital and walked around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps were enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but this one was a bit more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts were of Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, talking less than usual as he tried to cope with his own restlessness.
Stanning, a captain in a Royal Artillery regiment on a mission in Ghanistan, said: "I've been down with emotions this week, maybe it's a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It emphasizes again how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked and so did Robin.
It's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin so far.
Without Robin we would be nobody, so a huge thank you to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better person to coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The pair set a stunning rhythm that their rivals could not match.
Even in the final 500 meters, when crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large margin.
We were maximally focused at the moment.
Helen shouted, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn't want to achieve something great.
We weren't looking forward to today's fireworks, we just wanted to row well, go out and win the race, which we did.
The pair take a year to think before deciding what to do next.
Glover is getting married next week, and her future husband is TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say it would be my last race.
That would put too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to find out that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
I feel much better about it," she said.

Jail?
Rather, let them transport people for free, says taxi mafia hunter Rubeš about the groundbreaking indictment.
Six taxi drivers and a former Prague City Hall official are defendants, as CT reported.
You have made a number of reports in which you have exposed fraudulent practices and those who are supposed to be in the group that will stand trial.
You have faced several unpleasant skirmishes with the exposed actors because of this.
How groundbreaking is the news of the indictment of members of an organized group for you?
I was expecting some kind of trial.
I am mainly curious about the verdict.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
This is useless.
Primarily, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them by taking all the people for free.
This is a rather peculiar solution.
Does this mean that you do not perceive the possible punishment as effective enough?
For me, it's enough that some of them are so scared that they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one makes pingla, another delivers pizza, and one has completely given up on it.
Defendants could theoretically receive two to eight years in prison.
Do you think this is an adequate rate?
In general, I have a problem with imprisonment.
I consider this to be a bad punishment.
To put someone in jail, especially in such a case, is nonsense.
Such people should return to society what they took from it.
For a quarter of a century they have been destroying the name of our country and robbing people.
So let them now make a good business card and deliver people for free.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would work as community service.
Like someone goes to collect garbage, they would get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they'll get probation in the end and they won't care.
They find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Film Academy of Miroslav Ondříček in Písek and then at Tomas Bata University in Zlín.
He is one of the people who started in the Czech Republic with viral videos and videos directly for the web.
He works as an editor for internet television Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of programs, and now prepares the Prague Guide, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
In the form of short reports, Rubeš advises them which services to avoid in Prague and which ones he recommends to use without fear.
Previously, he filmed series called How to Do It, City of Deception?, Life in Luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Money.
The indictment refers to them as an organized group.
The police followed her for several months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be described as mafia-like?
They are such cute mobsters, not the kind we know from The Godfather.
They are more about mobsters - juniors, but they are definitely organized.
Just in the fact that they guard each other's relays (taxi ranks).
Prague is completely parceled out.
I have observed that, for example, the main railway station does not like Pařížská, Pařížská does not like taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Lazne (disco club)
Everyone just watches their own place and each group is somehow organized.
It seems to be a convoluted network.
The defendants are only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate who warned the driver against the checks.
As you say, undesirable phenomena have not disappeared from the streets.
In your estimation, what percentage of Prague taxi scammers is involved?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones are still on the street.
I am talking, for example, about Aleš Ryjáček.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he carries a telescopic baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands by the Charles Bridge and transports people.
The last time I rode with him, he wanted me to do seven hundred in three kilometers.
For some reason, the police did not detain him.
They chose only a few people from the whole large group.
However, the situation is the same in other locations in Prague.
By indicting seven people, it will be difficult to eradicate the already famous Prague abuse, which apparently has much larger dimensions.
Of course, this is not entirely useless.
It will help, but all evil will not be eradicated, that's true.
Do taxi drivers who rob foreign tourists still perform in the same places you have shown in your reports, i.e. near Charles Bridge or Pařížská Street?
Yes, exactly.
They stand in these locations every day and break the ordinances every day.
This is ignored by both the municipal police and the Prague City Hall.
It's not even a cat anymore, but complete indifference.
The business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Still, some of them, even if they are only part of the group, will be brought to justice.
This is already a breakthrough.
I must therefore ask: do you feel satisfaction?
If I took it as satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be to improve the center of Prague.
And even if I feel like it's a little better, I'll keep doing it.
It is necessary to push on the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief remains there, we should still do something to eliminate him.
We cannot be satisfied with that.
But it is not so, there are of course more.
Are you always trying to confront them in taxis?
Sometimes I do test drives and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week I caught a taxi driver, by the way from the same group, and was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three kilometers, although he then claimed that it was 56 crowns (he used a decimal point trick).
He had a receipt for it, the police came, and this taxi driver was so endearingly cheeky that he still went to the policemen and asked them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
A taxi driver pasted a decimal point on the taximeter and robbed tourists of 357 crowns.
Can it be said that the audacity of fraudulent taxi drivers did not subside even after you showed the faces of those who charged ridiculous amounts for a short ride in your footage?
Their audacity is still unbelievable.
What happened to the taxi driver demanding 56 crowns?
The police sent him away, saying they could not discuss with him on the spot because he had issued a receipt.
And I think that will be a problem in the court (six taxi drivers and one ex-official).
On one side there will be a taxi driver with his receipts, on the other side the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the municipality may not use secret recordings from a taxi as evidence in court.
When I was filming episodes about their scams, the taxi drivers themselves pointed out this precedent to me.
But I always wanted to use the footage only in a reportage.
Are you worried that this fact could protect them from the courts?
I hope that every judge will understand that no taxi driver could drive for six or ten crowns a kilometre, because he would not be able to make a living from it.
You talked about the decimal point trick, which underwater taxi drivers move especially in front of foreign clients.
Is it still current, or are they afraid to continue using this trick after your reports are published?
I think we popularized this trick by airing the show.
Recently I was driving with a taxi driver, he boasted to me that he was the honest taxi driver.
But then I noticed that black cardboard was glued from the side of the taximeter.
When I asked him what it was, he said, "You know what it is."
When fines have not worked well for taxi fraudsters, can the trial of their colleagues make a warning impression on them?
Is there anything at all that can deter them from scamming?
You talked about how you think they will always find a way to cheat.
I think nothing can deter them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are fair taxi drivers who should fight harder to get them out of there.
From my experience, I have to say that the fair taxi drivers in Prague fortunately prevail.
But do they want to go against those who spoil the reputation of their services?
They have taste, but they lack skill.
They can't walk around much and they can't say exactly what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (because of the proposal for a nationwide restriction coming from the office of Mayor Adriana Krnáčová), it was not very clear what they actually wanted.
Once they said that they do not protest against Uber, that they just want to have the same conditions as this service, then again they said that they want more than Uber.
It turned out that they just blocked Prague and created only the best possible ad for Uber.
How do you evaluate the approach of the Prague City Hall in solving the problem of overcharging fares?
It is obvious that the criminal police had to step in to solve something.
The magistrate was short on that.
They had a mole there who was bringing out information, that is, the taxi department had been doing its job for several years completely unnecessarily.
I hope that the official will be charged for all the thwarted checks until the last check so that he realizes what he has done.
That's the worst thing about it to me.
I was even with him on one control drive, which I found out later from their schedule.
Several months have passed since the last episodes of the series were published.
What's the response?
I mean mainly with foreign viewers, on whom the series is actually the most focused.
Whenever I have friends from abroad, I show them the videos.
And when we walk along the Old Town Square, they are surprised that the same people who are seen in the footage are really standing there.
Infamous Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I would build a fence around them so that people would look at them.
Museum of communism right on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a taxi when you need to?
Brightly.
I drive with services where I do not have to pay in cash, but by card.
I use services such as Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also many dispatching centers that are fair.
I have only taken a taxi on the street once since.
The driver said to me after getting into the car, "Wow, you have courage."
Bem dressed as an Italian tourist.
Fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were reported as early as 2005.
In the same year, former mayor Pavel Bém went on a control drive disguised as an Italian tourist and at the first attempt the driver cheated him of two hundred.
But editor Rubeš had worse experiences.
Taxi drivers charged him 820 crowns for a ride from the Old Town to Wenceslas Square, which comes to about 195 crowns per kilometer, as calculated by the reporters.
Prague City Hall set the maximum price at CZK 28 per kilometer.
There are also other surprising sums in the filmed reportage: for example, a two-kilometer journey from Pařížská Street to Truhlářská Street cost a tourist 400 crowns.
Expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at Charles Bridge.
For a ride to Anděl, which has 2.5 kilometers, they charge even six hundred crowns.
Marble is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemicals, and the longer the better.
Dirt from it goes well, although sometimes dirt has to be put down with a scalpel, it needs to be gouged out of the folds.
It's not easy and it's not fast, said restorer Vanesa Trostová from Oldřichov v Hájích.
Hats off to her: the tombstone is surrounded by scaffolding, which has to be climbed and climbed countless times.
"The restorer should be careful, patient and undemanding to the working environment," she said.
This is by no means her first restoration work in the Frýdlant region.
Thanks to her, for example, the stone elements of the façade in the rear wing of the Frýdlant Town Hall were restored, she also restored the statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Zátiší, St. John of Nepomuk in Frýdlant, Pietà in Frýdlantská Okružní Street, the Marian Column in Frýdlant or the Atlanta in the façade of the spa in Nové Město pod Smrkem.
The restoration of the tombstones of Melchior, Kryštof and Kateřina of Redern began in Frýdlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned of dirt and crusts, the loose stone parts are secured against falling and shifting; They will either anchor to the wall or to each other.
They will also undergo treatment and preservation of the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be gilded again.
"Then it will begin with gilding the inscriptions on marble slabs with pure gold leaf," said Věra Sobotová, an officer of the State Monument Care of the Municipal Office in Frýdlant.
There are no records from the past that the tombstone underwent any repairs.
On closer inspection, the holes drilled in the marble columns catch their eye.
They are hundreds of years old and are the remains of the tombstone decoration.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately after the Swedish raid during the Thirty Years' War everything disappeared.
They literally brushed the tombstone, Sobotová noted.
In the Church of the Finding of the Holy Cross, restorers are at home with a slight exaggeration.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to put in order the tombstones that were under water, the baptismal font, the wall paintings in the tomb and now the tombstone.
"We would also like to start stained glass in the future," Sobotová revealed.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, every year we put money into maintenance and repairs.
Restoration work on the restoration of the Redern tombstone will cost a total of 128 thousand crowns.
They will be covered by subsidies, the city will not put any of its money into this part of the restoration.
One hundred thousand crowns will come from winning the regional round of the Historical Town of the Year 2015 competition, the remaining 28,000 crowns are contributions from the Ministry of Culture, said Frýdlant Mayor Dan Ramzer.
The council decided to release the prize for the restoration of the tombstone.
Experts' opinions on future developments on selected foreign markets monitored through indices and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) at the horizon of one month and a half years.
Low volatility and growth prevail in the markets.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year.
The US S&P500 index, which underwent a 12% correction in February, is now at a new all-time high and has gained 7% since the beginning of the year.
This reaffirms the iron rule that traders should never go against the interests of central banks in the long term, which have always achieved their goals in the end.
With U.S. equities at an all-time high, volatility, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets rose happily and fearlessly thanks to the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing, and when, as today, the volatility index (VIX) remained steadily below 12 percent, is disappearing again.
And they don't.
Although the Fed continues to prepare markets for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative easing is well underway in both Europe and Japan, and last week the Bank of England stepped up to buy £70 billion in bonds over the next six months.
Thus, a new wave of quantitative easing pushes already low yields even lower, contributing to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long does this condition last?
That, of course, is a million-dollar question.
However, there are no risks in sight at the moment, the world economy is going through almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation on the commodity market and China is stabilizing and Brexit is basically no longer an issue, so we should not be too surprised if US stocks continue in a similarly calm regime.
It is a pity that Juncker does not study Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has taken on this important and challenging task.
"I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult job," said European Commission chief Juncker, when he appointed a French politician (really experienced, as he has been slick with so many different supranational political functions that it would be difficult to find a better example of the so-called European elite) as the European Commission's chief negotiator on the terms of the UK's exit from the EU.
Juncker's selection has dashed hints of hope that it is in the EU's serious interest to seek forms of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
However, most of the British media accepted Barnier's name as Juncker's act of war.
Barnier is a staunch European federalist.
They hate Great Britain.
As European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009 - 2014), he was in charge of the reform of European banking law.
He conceived it as only he could conceive it: a bitter enemy of the Anglo-Saxon conception of the free market and the model of capitalism.
A proponent of multilateral regulation, he co-authored the concept of the so-called banking union and, with a grudge against everything that comes from the City of London, pushed through legislation of excessively harsh regulations on the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, Paris' representative in the dispute with London, will be a tough, intransigent and probably ruthless negotiator.
That's probably not good news.
In this context, how can we fail to recall the calm and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which the prudence, insight and empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much.
This is one of the reasons why Czechs and Slovaks can be the closest friends and allies today.
It is a pity that Juncker did not learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this respect.
It would be to everyone's good!
Earthquake around Putin?
The ruler of the Kremlin released his close Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin fired Sergei Ivanov as chief of staff on Friday.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajno.
This was reported by the Russian media, citing a statement by the Kremlin press service.
Putin has indicated that he is releasing Ivanov at his own request.
At the meeting, which was broadcast by Rossiya 24 television, the president said that he was accommodating Ivanov's wish, expressed when he took office, that he wanted to be the head of the presidential administration for no more than four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The news of the change at the head of the president's administration, which will now be led by Ivanov's current deputy Vajno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, 63, is described as one of Putin's closest aides.
For example, this former KGB officer previously held the positions of Minister of Defense and Deputy Prime Minister.
He will now also leave his seat as a member of the President's Security Council.
But Ivanov said in a meeting with Putin that he was actually a record holder for his length of time at the head of the head of state's administration.
He stayed there for four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that in the 25 years since its establishment, 11 people have already been in this position.
Neither Kvitová nor doubles players Strýcová and Šafářová will play in the final.
So far, none of Friday's tennis matches have been turned into a final participation.
Petra Kvitova was the first to lose her fight, succumbing to Puerto Rican surprise Monica Puig in straight sets 4-4, 6-1, 3-6.
Kvitova was followed after a while by Czech doubles players Šafářivá and Strýcová.
The Williams sisters were looking for a win in the first set, but wasted two sets and the Russians eventually captured a set in a shortened game.
They then lost the second set 4-6.
Czech rowing recorded half the success rate in the morning program in Rio: skier Ondřej Synek easily won his semifinals, beating the second Damir Martin from Croatia by almost a second, despite slowing down at the end.
Today was good, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as possible, Synek said.
His opponents, unlike him, had to fight for advancement.
So it took some of their strength, it could be easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it will be easy, it just plays into my hands, said the rower of Prague's Dukla.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková, however, did not follow in Snyk's footsteps.
The thirty-five-year-old rower took the fourth position in today's semifinals and on Saturday she will start in the B final and fight for 7th to 12th place.
He will not defend the gold from London.
For the first time at the Olympics, I didn't make it to the final.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I rode a good race and gave it everything I could.
Opponents were simply better, Topinková Knapková bowed to them.
She fought until the end and believed she would be among the Elite Six at her fourth Games.
She gave up the fight just before the finish.
I knew that the girls were balanced, that anyone could advance from that field.
I was surprised by the Chinese woman that she had such a finish.
And I thought I could get to the final through the Austrian.
"Unfortunately, today was the race of a lifetime, said the 2011 world champion.
Far behind the final gates in Rio remained a young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who did not manage to break through from the qualification for the second time, this time with a rimfire rifle lying down.
Nepejchal took 33rd place.
Qualifying went best for the Russians.
Sergei Kamensky advanced from first place with 629 points, Kirill Grigorian from second place (628.9).
Nepejchal's shot was worth 620.5 points.
For the first time, athletes also spoke to the program in Rio, including Czech heptathletes Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
Cachová ranks eleventh after the second discipline of the Olympic competition, Czech record holder Eliška Klučinová is twenty-two.
The lead is Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimetres, as well as Belgian Nafissatou Thiam.
Both of them provided the best ever heptathlon altitude performance.
They tried to jump 201 centimeters, but failed.
German, Russian, who is worse?
Aside from the absurdity of the question posed in this way: German society has undergone profound self-reflection, while Russian society has not.
There were dictators in both great Eurasian nations in the 20th century, and regimes came to power that were inhuman, brutal, and terrible.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks contributed greatly to the 94 million victims of communism listed in the Black Book of Communism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent warfare, or inhumane experiments.
The Nazis exterminated about 6 million Jews in an inhumane manner, and the total casualties of World War II are estimated at 60 million.
Atrocities were carried out by both Germans and Soviets in occupied or abandoned territories.
In Germany and the USSR, not only a few individuals were guilty, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes, whether actively, passively, or simply by cowardice or burying their heads in the sand.
This is not specific to these nations, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, the immediate end of the war came de-Nazification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask, "Daddy, Grandfather, why did you participate in such atrocities?"
How could you!
This brought real reflection and healing to society.
Until recently, the German elites were mainly concerned with the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly do not want to reannex Alsace-Lorraine or attack someone - in revanche - militarily - everyone will recognize.
After losing the Cold War, there was no great reflection in Russia.
The window of possible positive changes finally closed at the turn of the millennium, when a former KGB officer (sic!) came to power Vladimir Putin.
An often criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putin's Russia is to revanch, to conquer lost territories, to humiliate the West.
The health, prosperity and future of one's own people is of no value to the Verkhushka.
Smite yours, and strangers shall be afraid.
I still believe that it is only through decades of despotic regime that Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - destined for Asian (self-)tyranny.
Who benefits from the rise in tensions over Crimea?
Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea region has deteriorated.
Who benefits from rising tensions?
After a prolonged period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia deteriorated further.
The pretext of the Ukrainian side has become the Crimea peninsula, which was annexed to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, the reports from both sides are contradictory and difficult to verify independently, so we can only think about the old familiar question: who benefits?
According to reports from Moscow, there were terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
To the information about the arrest of members of the Ukrainian special forces on the territory of Russia, the well-known answer from the case of the pilot Savchenko came that they were allegedly kidnapped on the territory of Russia.
If we accept the Ukrainian version, how would Russia benefit from a worsening of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: in nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only harm Russia, especially from the West in the form of further tightening of sanctions and intensification of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, against the backdrop of the immigration crisis to Europe, attention has been withdrawn from the situation in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has completely lost its credibility in front of its people, with current support for President Poroshenko hovering around 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have gone bankrupt a long time ago if it were not for generous financial injections from the EU and especially the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime once again needs to resolutely draw attention to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation with the electorate in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the security forces once again want to show themselves as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to even greater Russia.
We can only hope that all those who are trying to unleash an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers, but all ordinary people on both opposing sides, and will stop their hostilities in time.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, Bulgaria's monthly inflation rate reached 1% in July.
This is the highest in several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, as measured by the CPI, over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous period of 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 vs. December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared with July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, an increase in travel by the following consumer goods groups was recorded in July 2016: food and soft drinks (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
The price decreases were recorded for clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household effects and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education remained at the same level as the previous month.
The U.S. secret services reportedly monitored the hacking attacks of the Russians for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks became public last month, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was looking into an attack on the servers of the Democratic party headquarters.
But there is no official report of Russian involvement in the attack.
Moscow has denied involvement in the attack.
The report on the surveillance of the alleged Russian attack was top secret, because its disclosure would reveal that the US intelligence services are monitoring the hacking attack and could reveal how they do it and what resources they use.
Two Russian intelligence services are said to have been involved in the offensive.
New Cybersecurity Advisory Board
The material on the tracing of the Russian trail was coded and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters reported.
Of the public officials, only a small group of eight leading members of Congress, called the gang of eight in the US, was informed.
It consists of the leaders of both chambers, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the Democratic leaders in both chambers, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of congressional defense and security committees.
Acting Democratic Party leader Donna Brazile announced Thursday that she is creating a cybersecurity advisory board to "prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection for Democratic Party servers."
There was a dangerous parasite in the smoked salmon from Albert.
The chain apologized.
Based on a consumer's suggestion for health problems after consuming the food Smoked wild salmon - pieces 100 g, expiry date 22.11.2016, Prague hygienists carried out an inspection in Albert stores on Wenceslas Square and Na Můstek.
The inspection revealed that the lot L23012562/T4 with the expiry date of 22.11.2016, which was pointed out by the customer, is no longer available and therefore a product of the same batch with the expiry date of 11.12.2016 was taken.
Laboratory testing confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
This is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
It is dangerous for humans - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a strong allergen and live larvae ingested by humans can penetrate through the stomach wall into internal organs, Šticha said.
We apologize to customers for the inconvenience of this branded product.
We immediately withdrew the batch from sale and recalled all other batches of this item as a precaution.
The mistake was made on the part of the supplier with whom we are negotiating, and at the same time we had this product tested, Albert spokeswoman Barbora Vanko told Novinky.
If the customer has bought this product, he can return it at any of the chain's stores for a refund.
Larvae destroy frost even with sufficient heat treatment
The seller was the company Nekton - Vrňata.
Hygienists informed the Prague and Central Bohemian Veterinary Administration about the occurrence of a dangerous product.
According to the server, bezpecnostpotravin.cz people after ingesting the parasite can become ill with anisakiosis, which is manifested by severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can be asymptomatic, the Czech News Agency reported.
Symptoms appear an hour to two weeks after eating undercooked infected fish.
After three weeks from the onset of the disease, the larvae usually spontaneously leave the digestive tract.
Both adult worms and larvae are sensitive to both higher and low temperatures, so they are killed either with sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or when it is frozen.
Veterinarians have recently checked the salmon at the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three out of five samples examined had the parasite in them.
According to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS), the consignment with 1700 products arrived in the Czech Republic at the beginning of April.
To date, 919 packages have been dispatched, in the vast majority to the Ahold chain.
Unsold stocks of the product are currently being withdrawn from stores, SVS spokesman Petr Pejchal told CTK on Friday.
Veterinarians immediately after finding positive samples prohibited the sending of other products from the warehouse.
A seventeen-year-old British woman wanted to flee Raqqa after apparently being killed by a Russian airstrike.
After initial enthusiasm and a quick marriage to the jihadist, who was soon killed, came disillusionment.
For British girls, the expected paradise of the caliphate turned into hell on earth, from which there was no escape.
According to relatives, the girl was in contact with her sister Halima.
She repeatedly called her in Britain and said she wanted to go back home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They are ordered to shoot indiscriminately, according to The Telegraph, a lawyer for the late girl's family, Tasnim Akunjee.
The last clues led to Raqqa, from where the girl spoke for the last time.
Then came only the news of her death, which can not be verified.
The family communicated with her from their flat in East London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Raqqa and cross the Turkish border.
There, they hoped to meet the former student again.
Kadiza was likely killed before she could flee because the house she was staying in was flattened by an airstrike in May, ITV News reported.
The TV added that the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian plane that was attacking an IS stronghold in Syria.
You would bring down the blue from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, the family's lawyer.
In the week when [Kadiza] was thinking about fleeing Islamic State territory, an Austrian woman was caught trying to escape and, according to available information, was publicly beaten to death.
"I think she (Kadiza) took that as a warning and decided not to take any chances," Akunjee said.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with 15-year-old school friends Shamima Begum and Amira Abas, set out on February 17 last year.
At home, they only said they were going out.
But they headed to Gatwick Airport and from there via Turkey into IS-controlled territory.
According to the lawyer, the girl's family did everything in their power to get Kadiza back.
You would take the blue from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, and this family did everything they could, straining all they could to get their daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking being caught themselves, the lawyer added.
The only positive is that the fate of Kadiza can serve as a deterrent for other girls or even boys who are fooled by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases where people went there, realized how things were there, understood how different it was from the promises of Islamic State propaganda, and wanted to go back," Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadiz's classmates is unknown.
But because they have also gone silent, their families must come to terms with the fact that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries the village of Inveraray was the county centre and seat of the Duke of Argyll.
From the mid-18th century, courts were held at the town hall, and the basement under the hall served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the prisoners stayed were deplorable, and many prisoners attempted to escape.
Many of them even successfully.
Therefore, the city representatives decided to move the prison premises to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much friendlier to prisoners, with heating and gas lighting.
It was not in operation for a long time anyway, it was closed for economic reasons at the end of August 1889, because smaller correctional facilities were expensive to operate and did not pay much.
Stories of convicts and ghost hunts.
The prison opened to the public a century later, and visitors can compare the old building with the new one to see for themselves how different the conditions were.
Guides in period costumes enhance the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room where visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be locked in one of the cells, usually for a keepsake photo or to evoke the feeling that prisoners experience behind bars.
In addition, Inveraray prison is one of Scotland's most notorious haunted sites.
Several groups of paranormal hunters have gone there and to this day the museum allows people to come and hunt some ghosts.
Such a night, however, costs 300 pounds, which is about 9500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village is also attracted by great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
The "anime" effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
Every day, Snapchat allows some 150 million users to change reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd.
You can make yourself a pineapple, a dog or a character that seems to step out of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate over 30 million enhanced selfies every day.
Any mistake will be published immediately.
Snapchat's filters have drawn criticism in the past, with accusations that the app promotes blackfacing or that it promotes white skin tones as an ideal of beauty.
So when it offered users a filter this week that made them slanted eyes, crooked teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians — "yellowface."
And they asked if these repeated contentious questions pointed to a larger problem for society - a problem with diversity.
On Wednesday, the Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and the news and outrage quickly spread, and Snapchat said the very next day that it had canceled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as a speech bill to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asians.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded them of painful stereotypes in action.
Others bluntly rejected the comparison with anime.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student from Korea whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was "harmful and embarrassing, to say the least."
She added that "it's hard to argue against comparing the obvious Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not just about the yellowface, but that the yellow face is taken to a contemptuous extreme.
Snapchat isn't the only company that has crossed those cultural lines.
American culture seems to have a never-ending struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Holywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And the sheer number of young people on Snapchat — who are more racially diversified than their older partners — may mean that even greater sensitivity can be expected.
"When one Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to a user," Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday, "it's very hard to go unnoticed today than they used to."
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes racially motivated issues reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat's recruitment.
Katie Zhu criticized the overwhelming white, all-male management of the company, ending the article with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that they don't have any diversity among employees and people of color at the moment these things are decided," said Zhu, who is of Chinese-American descent, "or people of color work there, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable to speak out."
Other observers share her opinion — a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not disclose figures regarding the diversity of its employees, saying it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial origins of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on the underrepresented population and internal inclusion management.
Zhu adds, "I'm curious if they really need more users like this who can say it's not okay," adding that her account will remain closed.
Army officers distorted intelligence on IS, parliamentary committee says
A parliamentary committee said in a report released Thursday that officers from U.S. Central Command had altered intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground.
According to a preliminary report by a task force assembled by the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Defense, there was "widespread discontent" among Central Intelligence Agency analysts who said their superiors changed their assessment of U.S. efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as CentCom, is the Army's central office in Tampa, Florida, overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
A press release accompanying the report said: "Intelligence outputs approved by senior Centcom officers typically offered a more positive picture of U.S. counterterrorism efforts than those confirmed by facts on the ground, and were consistently more positive than analyses obtained from other parts of the intelligence community."
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable — our fighters are harmed when superior policymakers are presented with flawed analysis," said Ken Calvert, a congressman and Republican from California.
Centcom's leadership failure extends to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report details the Central Staff's ongoing problems in describing and analyzing U.S. efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no conclusive evidence that top Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be altered, the report said analysts felt they were pressured by Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
"In the first half of 2015, many press releases from the Central Staff, statements and congressional statements were significantly more positive than what events actually were," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military offensive to take Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
"This is very clear after months of investigation," Rep. Mike Pompeo, a representative of the Republican Party from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, senior U.S. Central Staff intelligence officers manipulated the staff's intelligence outputs in order to downplay the IS danger in Iraq.
Republicans set up the task force after learning of analysts' concerns that intelligence information about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, must be followed by further investigation.
There is another investigation in Centcom's intelligence services, led by the Inspector General of the Department of Defense.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom established a very narrow process for compiling an assessment of information about ISIS and Iraqi security forces," Rep. Adam B. Schiff, chairman of the committee and a representative of Democrats, said in a statement.
In the words of Adam Schiff, the process "led to distortions of intelligence output," damaged morale among analysts, and "did not take sufficient account of dissenting opinions."
However, Schiff and Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions according to "a pattern or political situation."
The preliminary results of the parliamentary inquiry were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation into the Pentagon's inspector general, which was launched after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander-Lt. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the parliamentary report because the inspector general's investigation was still ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of comprehensive data, and that the Intelligence Community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these crucial national security issues."
The investigation has implications beyond whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (a statement now being made by a growing number of defense officials).
However, last year's indictments raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the Central Staff to honestly assess military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis sites.
Criticism of the Islamic State's intelligence reflects conflicts for more than a decade, with Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker writing a research paper stating that President George W. Bush's administration — despite the objections of many analysts — advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in countering Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, authorities announced that Hooker's team had concluded that, despite public statements to the contrary, air strikes against Islamic State refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's financial resources, as the group had built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings had not been passed on outside of headquarters.
The commander of Centcom, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticized last year after many lawmakers found Senate testimony too positive an assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced at Centcom by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. won the field hockey game for the fourth time in a row, so today will be the decisive match for the Great Britain team
Katie Bam scored three goals in a 6-1 victory against Japan and scored the first two goals of the U.S. women's field hockey team just a day later in a 3-0 match in which America beat India 3-0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two matches is an achievement worth remembering, but Bam, 27, said she wasn't sure she'd ever done that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I am not one of those who write down their goals.
But he knows this: The Americans lead the Olympic tournament 4-0 and share first place in the group with Great Britain, who remained undefeated on Thursday after beating Japan 2-0.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final match of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will decide who will finish first and who second out of the group of six teams.
The team from the first place will avoid the strong Danes, who are at the top of the second group, a little longer.
Whatever Saturday's game ends, the Americans' surprise run caused a stir four years after finishing among 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 years old (her twin sisters played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she didn't make the final roster.
Then came 2012, when neither she nor the members of her team were doing well.
The next year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
In London, we didn't have the pace of work that we have today.
We made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half by scoring a goal with a close-range bekend.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and held the score 1-0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bam took the opportunity.
She escaped down the left side of the field, then weaved into the middle and scored the ball into the net to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added her final goal midway through the fourth quarter.
The elimination of American goalie Jackie Briggs, who helped to one goal in each of the three victories, was the first of the tournament.
He's in great shape.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good place now," Parnham said, but how good it is will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Zen trampolines in the middle of the Olympic rampage
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro show a persistent, indescribable and biased alternation of competition and effort.
It is how the Olympic torch itself would be a hot baton that is passed from the shooter to the swimmer, gymnast and triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the queue at a café without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the animosity between Michael Phelps and Chad le Close.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the women's up-and-coming darling with dimples on his cheeks, is in the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names will be heard in prime-time homes between commercials and sponsors' spots if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a fencer.
But Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in trampoline jumping.
The Olympic flame does not shine equally on all competitions.
Further from the center, a little in the shade, are sports that are not universally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style - and it will probably reign for a long time.
But if I can name my extraordinary favorite, let me draw your attention to the inconspicuous charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it was first introduced at the Sydney Games, after 16 years of intervention, the sport remains almost unnoticed - many of the people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
There may be regional indifference.
The U.S. never won a medal in trampoline jumping, and until 2012, none of the athletes even made it to the finals.
Prizes in the men's category are usually split between China and Russia, and in the women's category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will be defended by Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada.
Trampoline jumping is also unlucky, partly because to the ear of the uninitiated, it will seem more suited to a clown university than to the Olympics.
I must confess that I am not an expert, but only an enthusiast watching from the ground.
It has comic potential - the cartoonish vibes of endless reflection - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, two sports that it combines in each other.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish "el trampoline", which means "diving board."
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them up to almost 10 meters high and perform sets with several elements (flips, screws and combinations) before finally landing on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic program, they are ranked according to performance, difficulty and "time in the air".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is forward.
Gold medal contenders have to go farther, faster and higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
They are trying to catch up not only with the finish line or the starting wall, but also, as the television news reports, another imaginary line: the world record or the Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is classy, admirable, a little fanatical - and enough to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it's also a bit exhausting when you watch the Olympics.
Jumps on the trampoline in this regard bring relief.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is upwards.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she bounces as if weightless like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then up again effortlessly.
Without competition and, of course, difficulty, it is not possible, but for the duration of the set there is no fierce fight to reach the goal, no measuring distance, but only perfect, graceful springing of time and gravity.
This is just the closest the Olympics and Zen will come on.
The women's qualifiers and finals take place on Friday afternoon at 1 p.m. Eastern Time, and the men's competition takes place at the same time on Saturday.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of the afternoon block, which begins at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise peaceful, pleasant moments that you will probably overlook despite the other fights.
And if attention is to be achieved only by making male athletes the subject of loving glances and materialization – as USA gymnasts recently proposed, according to the Wall Street Journal – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new gasping fans.
"A generation of protesters" in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have met with violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot dead during clashes with police.
Is war imminent in Ethiopia?
For the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
In recent months, however, anti-government unrest has engulfed the country and is spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government's response has been merciless.
Witnesses say police shot and killed crowds of unarmed protesters.
Circulating videos of the protests, believed to date back to late last year or early this year, show members of the security forces beating young people with sticks after being forced to stand on their hands against a wall.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to hold this country together and taking a step forward will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group's research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is supported by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence agencies work closely with Ethiopians to counteract the threat of terrorist attack in the region, particularly in Somalia, and few, if any, African countries receive such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy developed at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly - there is even a new suburban train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - human rights organisations talk incessantly of government repression - opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were banished, imprisoned, killed or driven far out into the desert.
However, this may change.
"When you choke people and they have no choice but to protest, there is a breakthrough," said Seyoum Teshome, who lectures at a university in central Ethiopia.
All the youth are protesting.
A whole generation is protesting.
The complaints are many, ranging from land disputes to absolute control of the ruling coalition's power.
After last year's elections, which were widely criticized, the ruling party and its allies won the last opposition-held seat and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, pressure is mounting on the border with Eritrea. The conflict along this inaccurately marked, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to take advantage of the confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why, after years of smoldering beneath the surface, these bitter feelings have flared up again.
The first is seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Many Ethiopians have only been able to communicate through social networks in the last few years, when cheaper smartphones have become widely available and Internet service delivery has improved.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is commonly the case during protests, many people can still communicate through internet proxies that hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they gathered for the protests.
There is also greater solidarity between the Oroma and the Amhara, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromoo and Amhara are not natural allies.
For long ages, the Amhara, mainly from the Christian hills of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and trade, taking advantage of the Oromöms, many of whom are Muslim and live in the lowlands.
But that's also changing.
"We are on the road to unified leadership," said Mulatu Gemechu, the leader of the Orom.
The largest protests took place in areas inhabited by Amhara and Orom.
Many Amhara and Oromo believe Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by the Tigrayi ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and controls the military, intelligence, commerce and politics.
The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012 when he succumbed to an unmentioned disease.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at detecting early signs of discontent and using envoys to process opponents and win them over to his side.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge," said Abdi, an analyst of the conflict.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been pulled out of relative obscurity in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in Tigrayan-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, after thousands of people protested what analysts said was an election that the government had cowardly and then stolen.
A crackdown followed, during which many protesters were killed - albeit fewer than in recent months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as a new commuter train and measurable progress in fighting poverty.
However, it is quite clear that this has not stopped the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government.
And dangerous ethnic formation is taking place.
Last month, protesters in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked Tigrayan-owned business firms, and resentment against Tigreans on social media has become increasingly common.
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently said the base was closed.
While the West wants to unequivocally support democracy, it also does not want its ally to disintegrate in an already volatile region.
"That," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of the blade."
Donald Trump Explains His Statement About Obama and ISIS Funding as 'Sarcasm'
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to downplay the latest controversy sweeping his campaign by saying he didn't mean it when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to speak clearly to the American public.
It also puts his supporters, who strenuously defended him in turbulent times, in an awkward situation and has to explain that he may not have meant his remarks.
Following the proposal at a meeting Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday night, insisting in interviews that he really did not intend to say that the president and Clinton created ISIS.
But in a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he was just being sarcastic.
The post was the opposite of a claim just a day ago, when Trump said in several interviews that he meant his allegations.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help soften Trump's remark by reminding him that Obama was seeking to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee did not respond.
The latest storm comes as Trump has tried to focus his campaign's attention on the economy as his approval ratings plummet.
Trump and Clinton took part in a duel on economic issues in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
On Twitter, he again warned that Clinton's proposals were linked to tax increases, saying he thought her speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm to defend himself before.
In late July, after drawing criticism when he suggested that Russians should hack into Clinton's emails, he later explained his remark by saying, "I'm sarcastic, of course."
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and moderate them as needed.
"I think it's his way of testing the extent to which some messages resonate with his supporters to see how they react, and then by the reaction in one way or another, 'give an explanation,'" said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who followed the language that both candidates used.
But I also think he is skillful in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be explained in different ways.
As the polls continue to fall in his favor, Trump has adopted an even more mocking tone in recent days, instead of toning things down for the general electorate.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed Tump well behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and very closely behind her in Florida.
Trump tries to avoid apologizing for the provocative statements he makes, but he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump faces increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put his devoted supporters, who must publicly stand behind him, however provocative his remarks, put him in an awkward position.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City who is one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate at length in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is valid political commentary," Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization that it quite wrongly called a newcomer. And it happened because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most ordinary Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to flourish and failed to manage the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Ahead of Friday's rallies in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to fire up the media on Twitter for rehashing and biasing his every word.
He laughed at the "poor, pathetic" TV pundits who tried to understand him and said, "They can't do that!"
Several Democrats sneered at Trump's apology, saying it was just more evidence that he was unfit for the presidency.
The café was pushed out of the market by prices. Now he's back at Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a shabby place in Williamsburg where you could only pay in cash, with no Wi-Fi, but where coffee had been served for 15 years.
Naturally, it was pushed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie — the store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 — sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss of the growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is ransacked and Verb is now a soap store."
But if New York is change, then it's also reinvention.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts credit cards, but some of the original staff work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Also the coffee is still good.
The manager of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original café who is also the owner and CEO of the new location.
He started in Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of the customers offered to pay for the move to a new location, he said he would do it with pleasure.
Rodriguez, 36, left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same pastry supplier and bought the same model of espresso machine.
He even reused the lighting from the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He began to use new ingredients.
Ham, egg and cheese sandwiches and toppings such as capers and fried onions are on offer.
There are also bowls of brown rice.
The café no longer serves beer, but offers fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of native regulars.
"A number of original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg because of prices," he said.
Last Sunday, one of those customers, Rebecca Oliveira, was here.
Mrs. Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg and frequented the Verb Cafe.
It ran out even when the café moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee completely for a while.
"I found that what I love is the coffee and culture in Verb," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, but that day she had mixed chai, another novelty, instead of her usual iced coffee.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-time customer, has been loyally coming to Verb since 2003.
We go before work and always order the same thing.
"At a quarter and eight every day, like clockwork, I come here and they are already preparing my roll with everything and butter for me," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but occasionally puts bacon, eggs and ham on his bun.
Rodriguez said he wasn't sorry the soap store had taken over his old location.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the café as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
The café was also well received by the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to put it soon so that his new neighbors would feel at home.
The new location has even more advantages.
A local fruit juice manufacturer wants to bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There is a possibility for the café to expand into the neighboring building.
For many customers, it's enough to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the café closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the café reopened, going in and having a coffee was like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressing food from the time of crisis - in the "Square Meal"
Shortly after taking office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office having lunch.
Gourmet President Roosevelt enjoyed select dishes from 5th Avenue, such as goose liver pate and Maryland turtle soup.
But his menu for the day was more modest: devilish-style eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée and, for dessert, plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who were suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are dedicated to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe's latest book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book "97 Orchard" tells the life story of an apartment building on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new collaborative work, "A Square Meal," to be released Tuesday by Harper, is the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity and met the reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small, austere buffet in the Flatiron district that has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane, 54, ordered cream cheese and a sandwich of chopped olives, while Andrew, 57, had turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball, which the couple said was perfect for talking about food during the crisis.
"The meatballs were very popular," Miss Ziegelman said.
Peanut, liver and bean meatballs were sold.
They were made from the ingredient and other cheap food that set the ingredient.
Imagine the amount of peanuts you would have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe smirked.
"They would lie in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served as a "eat what you eat" buffet.
Teams of women cooked for farm workers, and freshly baked cake was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" traces the ways in which the nation coped with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of plenty.
"It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people," Coe said in explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Equally feared was the new budget diet: Mysterious foods like meatballs and casserole dishes proliferated, casseroles as "an amazing way to use leftovers," Ziegelman noted, because chefs could hide unaesthetic ingredients under a layer of creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat—for years a central fixture of American food—has become a cost-effective luxury.
Strange mixtures that were supposed to serve as a caloric and nutritional filler took precedence over taste or even common sense in cooking.
During her research for a book containing recipes, Miss Ziegelman prepared a period dish of roasted onions stuffed with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the evening table," Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman stressed, "It was surreal."
Peanut butter with roasted onions do not go together.
It was typical of a lot of homemade recipes.
As never before and never since, domestic economists—among them Louise Stanley, shoe of the federal bureau of domestic economics from 1923 to 1943—directed the country's eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, urged women to take the reins of the budget, and turned slices such as creamy spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
In particular, desserts were created in the government's response to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "I'll have a pie" pose.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farm cuisine of his childhood, he dined like the chosen millionaire he became.
"He liked to eat continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Andrew Coe said.
He was eating in an almost gilded room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not persuaded him to set an example on her own stomach.
As the book relates, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste. This led to the White House "not only being served almost the darkest food in all of Washington, but also the most dismal way prepared."
Many of the eating habits of the crisis disappeared as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy has remained in our constant exploration of calories and nutritional values, says Miss Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple say that while writing the book, they better understood the eating habits of Miss Ziegelman's mother — such as why she couldn't throw away food.
"She was really worried about wasting food," Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "People were sick of her."
There was an accident with wreaths.
When Eisenberg's tables were clean, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum cream," Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each reluctantly buried a spoon in a thick brown mass.
Surprisingly, it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And like a good householder, he said to his wife, "A little chopped walnuts would be useful."
Europeans: Migrants go for benefits.
Most of the refugees who flock to Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
This is what TV shows would look like if we made them.
A group of Russian artists calling themselves 2D Among Us make fun of their native country.
Using photoshop, he creates collages that humorously show how it would look if famous series and movies were filmed in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to attorneys' fees in the patent case against hepatitis C against Merck
A district court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to reimbursement of attorneys' fees it incurred in a hepatitis C patent lawsuit against drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, a judgment that found Gilead to pay $200 million in damages for infringement of two Merck patents related to Gilead's highly successful drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, was overturned after a federal judge found repeated wrongdoing on Merck's part, including lying under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman said in a filing Thursday that Gilead is entitled to a waiver of fees incurred in connection with its representation in the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for next-generation hepatitis C drugs, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming they owned basic lab research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
US-backed military forces claim to have gained full control of the city of Manbij
U.S.-backed military forces have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a spokesman for the group said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now combing the city after the departure of the rest of the group of radicals who were hiding in the city.
The forces have freed more than 2,000 civilians held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the Manbij military council told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching it," he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax return, which said the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an actual tax of 34.2 percent.
The Clintons donated $1 million to charity in 2015, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Ex-President Bill Clinton contributed nearly $5.3 million in lecture fees, and the former secretary of state declared $3 million in income from Simon & Schuster for her book on her time at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, have released 10-year tax returns.
They paid a real tax of 20.3 percent in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be role models of financial transparency," Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton campaign, said in a statement.
Donald Trump, on the other hand, is hiding behind false excuses and backtracking on his earlier promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary for candidates for the U.S. presidency to publish their tax returns, even if they are not required to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers cited an audit by the U.S. Treasury Department's tax department as a reason for his refusal to release tax returns.
"Your move," said an aide to Hillary Clinton's campaign on Twitter, following the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
Michael Cohen, a special adviser to Trump, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to release tax returns until the audits are complete.
Trump's critics, who include 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, agree that his rejection raises questions about his net profits, charitable contributions, business transactions and various other relationships, including with Russia.
Clinton has been strong on the issue and released a video Friday in which she recalls how senior Republicans are urging Trump to release his tax returns.
On Thursday, he will raise the issue in his speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all the other presidential candidates have done for decades — release their tax returns," she told the people.
Politico reported that Trump paid little or no taxes for the past two years of the '90s, and a New York Times columnist quoted a number of tax advisers and accountants as saying this may be the case today.
Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election.
Clinton is pushing for a rule named after billionaire Warren Bufett that would ensure that anyone who earns more than $1 million a year pays a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based, Buffet called on Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he also passed an IRS audit and that Trump was "not afraid" by the IRS, but by voters.
The Clinton campaign released tax returns going back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32 percent federal tax and a combined tax of about 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The Clintons' 2015 tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, their earnings amount to just $100.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which the Clintons reported income in dividends and interest of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chili or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox method to prevent elephants from coming into human dwellings by throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, and the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy are promoting the procedure and training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to protect their homes and crops without harming animals using this non-violent four-step process.
Many of them used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since they developed this ... toolbox, we have seen a change in behaviour in these communities. People are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," Damian Bell, executive director of the Honeyguide Foundation, said in a statement.
The first and second steps are to shine a flashlight on the passing elephant and lower the horn.
If this does not discourage him, the so-called "cloud of chili" will be thrown out.
The chilli powder mixed with salt is wrapped together with the firecracker in a condom, its end is knotted so that only the wick peeks out of it.
After firing, the condom explodes and a fine chili powder is sprayed into the air.
Usually, one whiff is enough and the elephant will go in a different direction.
The last option is to set off fireworks, which will cause a loud, bright explosion.
Jewish director leans into Berlin hotel for removing code for calling Israel at the "request" of Arabs - RT News
A French film director of Jewish origin caused a stir in the media after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not have a code in it to call Israel, according to an employee following a "request" from Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah", vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of call codes at the hotel.
However, the country was not listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Hotel Kempinski Bristol offers the option of calling Israel through its own call centre.
The director was looking for an explanation and turned to the hotel reception with the problem.
The answer he received "shocked," he said, Lanzmann was "shocked."
A hotel employee replied that the measure was "decided at the discretion of the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason for this move irritated the director even more.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the call code of Israel be deleted," Lanzmann quoted the employee as saying in his letter.
According to Süddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case a "great disgrace."
We were horrified and shocked by the event.
That in itself is a huge shame.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany, and in such a hotel chain, is an even greater shame.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event provoked a strong reaction online, with people calling it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski hotel has simply "gotten lost" in the demands of Arab customers.
"Shame on you," reads another post, pointing out that the hotel, located on the posh Kurfurstendamm street, is located near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly dismissed any allegations, calling the incident an "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzman.
"A direct order has never been issued" not to include Israel in the list of call codes, Suddeutsche Zeitung quotes a representative of the Kempinski Hotel as saying.
He adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
A clash between students and police occurred in San Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday when students gathered for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The problem escalated when government law enforcement tried to disperse the students, which ended with police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
San Paulo Governor Gerald Alckmin's proposals to save money include closing nearly a hundred public schools and relocating 300,000 students.
Some of the protesters could be seen spray-painting graffiti on the wall against interim president Michel Temer.
The latest protest comes just days after demonstrators took to the streets en masse in support of ousted President Dilma Rousseff after the country's Senate decided to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran up 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, after the lifting of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran, trade turnover increased by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
As the ambassador said, since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies doing business in the country.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period for 2015, reaching the amount of $ 856 million.
Specifically, Russia's exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased 16 percent to $158 million.
The jump in trade was ensured by the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of tourists from Iran to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued around 35,000 visas, mostly travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran for the first time got into the top 20 countries by the number of tourists coming to Russia.
It is safe to say that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia last year will be surpassed," he said.
At the same time, a relatively small number of Russians visit Iran. The ambassador hopes that there will be a change here.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition," he said.
Scotsman Callum Skinner rushes home after Britons win gold in cycling
Callum Skinner of Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in the men's team sprint at the velodrome in Rio as the VB trio defended their London 2012 title.
The twenty-three-year-old Glasgow native was in the role of a brake, which was taken by the Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy, and the young man delighted the legend when he rushed to the finish line and stole the victory from the hands of the favored New Zealand.
Britain won a surprise victory four years ago, and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after finishing a modest sixth at the World Track Cycling Championships in March, although Hoy has since retired from his career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement for specialist starter Jamie Staff.
So Hindes appeared just in time.
Hoy's departure also left a vacancy that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man of the British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was champion with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but New Zealand took the jersey in the first round.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind after his round, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes going into a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy watched the race from his position as a BBC commentator and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes took their eyes off the podium.
Twenty-three-year-old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm here to get the best out of myself and honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the best.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win it.
After his triumph alongside Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.
He later retracted the remark and Britain's rivals had no opportunity to appeal.
This time, there was no such problem with this victory.
Hindes said: "With all the British flags in the stands, I felt like I was in London."
In the last three months, we have all come together as a team.
We've lost a lot of world races, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for a nation that has won seven of the ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then a successful five days await us at the velodrome.
With Kenny's form, it's not unthinkable that he would repeat Hoya's success and win three gold medals at the same time at the same Olympics.
That would mean a total of six gold and one silver medal for Kenny - who is 12 years younger than Hoy on the day and also has a birthday on March 23 (a date that seems sacred to British sport, which is also the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
The same as much Hoy earned.
Next, Kenny will participate in the sprint, which starts today and runs for the next three days.
The twenty-eight-year-old native of Bolton said: "I'm enjoying this one now.
A team race is always the best.
You win together with others.
To be honest, winning for yourself is a bit lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
That was the only medal race of the day, but there was more good news ahead of Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified fastest in the four-kilometre team pursuit race.
They finished with a time of 3:51.943.
The world record, which fell in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) take place on today's second day of the race, which Wiggins will certainly focus on.
Yesterday before the qualifying race, he debated with the stewards when the judges asked him to measure his height.
In a similar women's race, which continues and finishes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie set a world record with a time of 4:13.260.
Team VB relied on their strong track cycling team to dominate the mid-season of the Olympics and won plenty of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, showing absolute superiority in Beijing and London, expectations were lowered in the run-up to Rio.
Dramatic events unfolded behind the scenes, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and discrimination, and the retirement of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, as the first night of racing at the velodrome demonstrates, it seems that the legendary reputation that Team Great Britain can deliver top performance with perfect timing could be reaffirmed.
Portland smelter future, uncertain after power contract termination
The future of Portland's aluminum smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant that supplies the company with electricity and which has informed one of the smelter owners of its intention to terminate the electricity supply contract. All electricity supply contracts are expected to be shortened.
The move comes after the Victorian state government decided earlier this year not to extend the subsidies that keep the business going.
The fixed twenty-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at Alcoa Portland may be at risk.
Up to 2,000 jobs - direct or indirect - could be at risk if closed.
And because the smelter consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity generated in Victoria, further avalanche impacts can occur.
Alcoa closed Point Henry's smelter in 2014, leading to the closure of Anglesea last year.
Alcoa's smelter in Portland is unprofitable and threatened with closure.
The move follows years of speculation about the company's future, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and more recently over production prices.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminum smelter from Loy Yang A in Latrobe Valley, said it expects one of the other three owners to also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, small shares are held by the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
"The AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, in other words, that demand for electricity from the smelter will continue," she said.
The AGL said the contracts were so-called "reinsurance contracts" that were supposed to come into effect in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
"The AGL continues to anticipate that the contracts will share in the profit for fiscal 2017," the plant said.
Any potential impact on AGL earnings from fiscal year 2018 onwards is currently limited due to the strong commodity market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL said it had already listed a contract value of $187 million on its books "in case termination occurs."
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contract "does not affect its ... the ability to operate a smelting plant or to secure the supply of electricity to a smelting plant.'
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 that was to take effect in November this year, although it has yet to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of Portland's smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the sector.
AGL operations manager Stehpen Mikkelsen, who contacted analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If those two undertakings were to withdraw from the market, this would entail a substantial reduction in demand on the [electricity] market.
It would not be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall isn't just the star of the Kardashian reality TV show — he's now on the cover of September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, a model and fourth daughter of Clan Managing Mother Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
Kendall, the ambassador of the Estee Lauder brand, who showed at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, looking at this front page makes me want to cry," Kendall wrote.
The reveal of the front page was followed by a bizarre (or simply a sequel to the Kardashians' humoresque?) staged video featuring the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitly, along with them all, favorite uncle from show business, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest). They forgot about their sister's cover, only to end the scene with a classic twist: they're throwing a secret party.
It's a well-worn storyline in almost every "birthday" episode of a children's TV show (Seacrest says, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit on an eight-o'clock morning show), but somehow Kris needed to make sure the other girls could make a living off the publicity.
Because if we look at the September issue of Vogue, we've definitely entered a new era for the Kardashians.
Older sister Kim may have pushed Kendall onto the cover of Vogue (she was on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is in a different league.
The September issue of Vogue is the best-selling issue of the year.
The edition, which is more like an advertising book than a fashion magazine, attracts a wide range of advertisers (Fashionista calculated that of the 832 pages in last year's edition, 615 were pages with advertising content).
The reveal of the star that will appear on the front page is eagerly awaited, so it is not surprising that in the past two years, images of the magazine have been leaked before its official publication.
Women who have appeared on the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more "celebrities who make models" than "models who are celebrities" on the front page.
Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador, appeared on the cover in 2013, and a year later she had the honor of Lagy Gaga.
But while it's highly unlikely that Kendall — described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation — will fall into the first category, she'll be in very good company.
These celebrities aren't relatives of famous people, nor reality show stars, or kids of today who know how to make a well-edited video (though Jenner represents all of this).
They are demonstrably talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who hit the front page last year, had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Her position in the world of fashion will always be difficult due to her participation in reality shows.
Stephanie Seymore, the original Victoria's Secret model, criticized Jenner and her co-star Gigi Hadid in June, calling them "whores of the moment."
Those feelings were reignited with the news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this discontent is misplaced.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue in September.
She's a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
He performs for Mark Jacobs.
It sells you makeup by Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She sells photos of her daughter, Cindy Crawford, which she took for LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she performs on reality shows, perhaps just as one way to see Kourtney and her children.
Community Legal Aid Centres Annually Reject 160,000 People
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable citizens are rejected each year in community legal aid centres, and in the sector itself they are preparing for the effects that will have further cuts in funding for already over-staffed services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and people without the financial means to fight unfair evictions and the like - are rejected when they seek free legal assistance and representation.
Community legal services, already stretched to the limit, are preparing for further cuts.
Starting next June, these legal aid centers will lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of Queenslad Community Legal Aid Centres, said that according to the latest summary report from the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centres, five thousand people were found to be rejected each year.
Mr Farrell said that without the federal government's decision being overturned, the situation would get worse.
"Queensland's community legal aid centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are being denied the vital services they need," he said.
People who have escaped from relationships with an abuser, people with excessive and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unjustly dismissed - all these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, leaving thousands more vulnerable Queensland people to navigate complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately prevent this cut, so that people get the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
Over the past year, the state government has delivered on its commitment to ensure funding for legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community legal aid centers and their client communities, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign lawsuit after a member of staff allegedly pointed a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been sued for alleged inaction after they were told that the director of operations in North Carolina pointed a gun at a crew member while driving a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a court file filed Wednesday in Charlotte State Court by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign software trainer in the state.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before concluding that "it won't happen."
Director Earl Phillip "pointed his fingers at a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and pointed the barrel at Vincent's pat," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The file states that after complaining to local and regional campaign leaders, Bordini discovered that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"Guns don't have to fire to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused an uproar when he told voters in North Carolina that gun owners and gun owners (as regulated in the Second Amendment in the US) could intervene if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, is elected and allowed to appoint her judges.
The Trump campaign says the media took his words out of context and that Trump did not advocate violence.
In the lawsuit, Bordini seeks damages from the campaign for negligent surveillance and from Phillip for endangering personal safety, unlawfully using violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the message, which asked for comment.
Attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, the local news office in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
A call to his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, was not answered within a short period of time.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial election campaign.

Britain must spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, Heathrow is hugely attractive, just as London was in 2012, when we made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions could benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Startford and the East End.
And we will do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
We will create 10 000 new apprenticeships for our local communities alone, 40 000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
As before the London Olympics in 2012, there will be those who will think that the expansion of Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would be ridiculed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and even in the case of Heathrow, they will be proven wrong.
There will always be obstacles, but Heathrow can answer any question that concerns him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of £211 billion, and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented an £11 billion infrastructure investment programme on time and on budget, starting with the T5 terminal – which has been voted the best terminal in the world five years in a row, to the T2 terminal, which was built between two of the busiest runways in the world.
They are now ready to deliver a third runway, which costs £16 billion in private investment.
The London Games in 2012 were a huge success for the UK and I am convinced that the Heathrow expansion will be one as well.
It is time for us to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, secure trade for the future and leave a legacy of skills and employment of which Britain can be proud.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Minister for Commercial Affairs at the Treasury.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in the game of cat and mouse in ad blocking
Attempts to circumvent ad-blocking programs have become a cat-and-mouse game for companies that make money from online marketing. At least that's what one of the companies that program such software claims.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad filters on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a post on its site stating that users can update the filters in their program and block ads on the social network again.
Facebook said Tuesday that its desktop website will change the encoding around ads to make it more difficult for ad filters to determine which parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now claims that they have already circumvented the new codes.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that "this kind of war between the open source ad blocking community and those trying to circumvent them has been going on since ad blocking was invented," and that Facebook is likely to come up with another fix of its own.
The fact that the company, which owns the world's largest social network, has been involved in the war just goes to show how big a problem ad blocking has become for the industry.
According to a study conducted by Pagefair and Adobe last year, around 200 million people worldwide use ad filters — nearly four times as many as in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook advertising revenue, with 1.03 billion active users visiting Facebook from mobile devices every day.
A spokesperson said the company is going against desktop ad filters because mobile app ad filters for social networking and Instagram don't work.
Desktop ads still represent a profit high enough for Facebook to decide to invest in it.
Facebook also said Tuesday that it will update its "ad preferences" tool to give people a better control over how ads are shown to them.
On Thursday, Facebook said it was concerned about Adblock's new filters because they could also block non-ad-related content on sites.
"This is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this issue," a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Ad blocking is an insensitive tool, so we preferred to focus on building tools like Ad Preferences to put people in control.
A woman was hit by a car on a Swiss motorway
The victim lay on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to an incident in which a woman was run over by several cars on a highway in the early hours of Thursday morning, presumably trying to commit suicide.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the perpetrator of the "desperate act" was lying in the dark on the road and was run over by several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a woman aged 49, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers have already been interviewed, but police say not all have been identified. Police are urging these drivers and anyone else who witnessed the accident to come forward.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, attorney Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Genève.
It remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to avoid the impact?
That's what the prosecutor has to find out," Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases in the past five years, it appears that drivers will not be held liable.
In both cases - one of which involved a person walking on a highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper reported.
Last year, a police officer was cleared of charges of negligent homicide after she hit and killed a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
The court heard that the victim, aged 22, had been drinking alcohol and fainted on the road.
The court found that the police officer — who was responding to the distress call — had driven in a reasonable manner and that the presence of the man on the road was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident that occurred at Piges should report to the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies (AČCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to come to Prague as part of Prague Pride.
On Friday, the executive director of the ACCKA Kateřina Petříčková said so.
The sixth year of Prague Pride began on August 8, and the festival introduces the lives of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT).
Last year, about 35,000 people attended the event.
"Prague is one of the most popular destinations for the LGBT community for its high level of tolerance and wide range of specialized businesses," Petříčková said.
According to a survey by the organizers, foreign visitors to the festival spend an average of 3100 crowns per person per day.
To support their travel, special maps of Prague are available to gay tourists with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
"For tourism in general, LGBT clientele is very lucrative, they are interested in stays in higher price ranges with a high standard of travel services and they spend more than others," Petříčková said.
As part of the festival program, the first Pride Tourism Symposium is held this year.
Lectures are given by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas, such as family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival on Saturday will be the traditional procession with floats, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letná.
The march, which has been attended by thousands of people in recent years, will observe a minute's silence this year in memory of the victims of the June attack at a nightclub in Orlando, where an assailant shot and killed 49 people, mostly gay.
Pat and Mat celebrate forty years.
Undeterred handymen Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have been entertaining audiences young and old for forty years.
The pilot episode of this bedtime story series directed by Lubomír Beneš premiered on August 12, 1976.
The creation of this animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than a hundred countries around the world, was the cartoons of the artist and director Lubomír Beneš, which he invented for a magazine with two handymen, Mr. Ouholíček and Mr. Sedlec.
Beneš then invited dramaturge Jiří Kubíček and artist Vladimír Jiránek to collaborate and together they created the film Kuťáci.
The characters got their present appearance with a yellow and red T-shirt and a beanie and a radio in 1979, when a series for Slovak Television began to be created in Krátký film Praha.
The names Pat and Mat were given to the handymen in 1985, this time they were shot directly for Krátký film Praha.
In 1990, Lubomír Beneš founded his own animated film studio AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other parts were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other artists, many of which were co-written by Beneš's son Marek.
Currently, there are over ninety episodes with stories of these do-it-yourselfers, who are all falling under their hands, but they are never angry with each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and DIY enthusiasm, and in the end they are satisfied with their work, which they prove with the well-known gesture "... That's it!".
Pat and Mat have even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and theater, and characters and other toys with images of Pat and Mat are a hit with every toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji and for two-year-old Harmony.
The end of the week is in the sign of fairy tales, we have chosen for you one sports and one from life.
Both have a happy ending.
So let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
And what things do people spend the most on at airports?
This is Friday's overview of world websites.
First medal from the Olympic Games.
The island nation of Fiji is celebrating a historic success.
The rugby team of this archipelago defeated the British rugby team in the final of the Olympic tournament of sevens.
This is the first medal Fiji has ever won at the Olympics.
The wait for the acquisition of the first precious metal lasted sixty years from the sending of the first expedition to the Olympic Games.
Much of the credit for the success goes to the Fiji coach.
Ironically, it is Britain's Ben Ryan.
He has led the team since 2013 and after the final, as a British citizen, he could be happy, unlike his compatriots.
"Let's play free and easy and see if we can manage the biggest match in our history," the coach said before the final.
Fiji eventually dominated it and the small state of 900,000 inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The French daily Le Monde reported the news.
A new friend and happiness for a little girl.
2-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living without arms and legs since 11 months, has made a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," the two-year-old rejoiced, as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to remove the doll's arms and legs and then sit together without dentures.
Harmonia was diagnosed with meningitis B in less than a year of life, doctors gave her only a ten percent chance of survival.
There's nothing I don't love about her.
She is beautiful, smart, funny and never gives up.
He also has a detached perspective.
"I saw her introducing herself to the other children, saying, "Hi, I'm Harmony and I don't have hands," the mother added.
Look at the joy the doll evoked.
What do we spend the most on at the airport?
CNN reports that people spend the most on bottled water at airports.
Hudson's travel essential stores has released data for the past year, summarizing 10 products that customers buy most often at its airport stores.
Water was sovereignly the first.
Drinks were generally very popular, with eight of them in the top ten.
Ninth place went to a large pack of M&M candies with coconut flavor.
And can you guess who closes the top ten?
It is the only one of the above things that cannot be eaten.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Magazines include US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Rowing sovereigns.
We're just going to win, Murray and Bond laughed.
Rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have been reigning in the category of twos without a helmsman for seven years and confirmed their dominance at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, the mismatched pair switched to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and have been crushing the competition since 2009.
On the lagoon of Rodrigo de Freitas, they picked up their 69th win in a row in Thursday's final.
How are we different from others?
"We're just prettier," Murray joked during the Olympic regatta, when asked about the New Zealand pair's dominance.
Honestly, we don't do anything different from others.
We just train hard, very hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, Murray said.
Their dominance is also remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is almost two meters tall and a hundred-kilo chaser, academically looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
Moreover, they are of a different nature.
Bond studies and devotes himself to finance, Murray has had a charity boxing match.
Because of this, they don't spend much time together outside of rowing.
Eric gets into the boat basically thinking we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
"I tend to think about what can go wrong," admitted Bond, who demonstrated at the press conference that Murray is dominant in the crew.
He was always the first to respond, and Bond was waiting for his opportunity.
On the water, however, they destroy opponents with calm force.
They are at their own pace, and although they are often not yet in the lead halfway through the track, their opponents have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We race on a two-kilometer track and we never wanted to go all the way to the first kilometer.
We're just trying to go at a pace that no one else can.
"We know what we have to do to win," Murray said.
With his partner four years younger, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when both members of the Golden Four were without a helmsman.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later, they decided to switch to number two without a helmsman.
At the London Olympics, they atoned for perhaps the biggest defeat of their careers and confirmed their dominance in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us and didn't ask any questions.
This time it was a little more fun.
"We knew it was going to be damn tough and we had to make sure we were mentally well," Murray said.
We know that they all want to dethrone us.
We still have that target on our backs.
But we try to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA Climate Model: Venus Was Once Habitable
According to projections of NASA's new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for exploring Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions similar to those on Earth could once have existed on Venus, which is hot, waterless and saturated with CO2.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' low rotational speed can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
According to the latest simulations, however, it seems that Venus may once have a thin Earth-like atmosphere while rotating slowly.
The model also dealt with an earlier topography of Venus.
There were probably drier areas on the planet than on Earth, but there was once enough water and geographical diversity to support life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus previously also used the Sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
"In the GISS simulation, Venus exposes its day side to the sun during its slow rotation for almost two moons at once," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a new report.
This heats up the surface and creates rain, which creates a dense layer of clouds that act like an umbrella and shield the surface from too much solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than currently on Earth.
The model constructed a story of Venus similar to an evolution previously hypothetically constructed by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past — over the course of billions of years — it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light.
Its oceans evaporated and water vapor was burned by ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen escaped, leaving only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of a greenhouse gas -- this is Venus as we know it today.
The researchers published their results from a new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Colorado Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned from his position as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing the inability to participate in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and said the club would begin looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have served as the head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," Roy said in a statement.
I thought long and hard during the summer about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs and take it to the next level.
To achieve this, it is imperative that the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations aligns with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck for the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the league's top coach during his first season with the 2013-14 Avalanche.
He led the team to 112 points and first place in the Central Division. But Colorado faced Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, and over the past two years, it has always failed to win postseason games.
The Avalanche scored 39-39-4 in 2015-16 and were five points short of earning their second wild card spot in the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goaltender Roy has won the Stanley Cup four times — twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil rig workers resume talks and suspend strike
Leaders of the negotiating parties said strikes over wages for workers at an oil rig in the North Sea were suspended while all sides in the dispute met for a new round of negotiations.
Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have occurred sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process to resolve the current disagreements," the statement said.
Starting next week, we will have a series of full-day meetings over the next few weeks where we will try to look at issues from new angles.
According to the unions, their recent action, which they say was the first in more than 25 years, is a protest against wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates this year and paid out about 9 percent less to its North Sea suppliers due to negative market pressure.
The corporate rate cut follows a 10 percent cut for offshore companies in 2014.
The company argues that further cuts would give the company room to cope with the market decline.
On the other hand, Shell has struck thousands of people off its payroll and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries to modernise its processes in the wake of a mega merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from low oil prices, an economic situation linked to Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disagreements of a generation, leading up to the North Sea strike.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just a few," he said in a statement.
By comparison, nearly $1.4 billion in investment in new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared to the average over the past five years of around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in the Pleiades
The Kepler Space Telescope's latest mission to help astronomers is to obtain a nearly complete list of stellar rotation speeds from the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data are helping astronomers understand why the cluster's stars spin at different speeds, and how rotation time relates to planet formation.
"By comparing our results with other star clusters, we hope to learn more about the relationship between stellar matter, its age, and even the history in its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Pleiades star cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the cluster's stars are now reaching maturity and formed over 125 million years ago.
Now it rotates the fastest.
At moments of maximum rotation speeds, these teenage stars release huge amounts of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a retarding effect on them.
As the star ages, so does its rotational speed.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by measuring the time between the appearance of recognizable points on stars -- similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on rotational speeds, larger stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull likens stars to dancers, with larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades Ballet, we see that the slower spinning stars are more massive, while the ones that spin the fastest are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing star quality and rotational speeds.
"The Pleiades provide an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, for younger and older stars," Rebull said.
There's still a lot we want to learn about how, when, and why stars slow down their rotation speed and "hang up their dancing shoes," so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of the rotational velocities of the Pleiades in three studies that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualification agreement necessary?
If I did not apply, then the qualification agreement would not be concluded and after a few months I could transfer to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work after graduation without enrolling in specialized education?
My point is that in the field in which I would like to work, there is now a vacancy only in a slightly more distant hospital, but in about half a year there could be a vacancy in another where I would then like to work.
So I don't know how to deal with the situation for about six months, the question continues.
Mgr. Lenka Vlková answers.
No legal regulation provides for the obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - the hospital.
A qualification agreement is a legal institute regulated by the Labour Code and may be concluded between an employee and an employer in order to ensure the return of costs incurred in increasing or deepening the employee's qualifications.
In the health sector, there is a long-standing pressure not to conclude such agreements with a view to ensuring the labour mobility of healthcare professionals, and not all hospitals currently require such an agreement.
Pursuant to Act No. 95/2004 Coll., on conditions for obtaining and recognizing professional qualifications and specialized qualifications for the performance of the medical profession of doctor, dentist and pharmacist, participation in specialized education is considered to be deepening of qualifications (not their increase).
This means that a qualification agreement can only be concluded under the Labour Code if the costs amount to at least CZK 75,000.
No legal regulation stipulates the obligation to enrol in specialized education.
The law only lays down the conditions for an application for inclusion in the field of specialized education.
However, according to the law, a doctor is entitled to practice the profession of doctor already thanks to the completion of the necessary university studies, albeit under the conditions laid down by law (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized competence in the relevant field).
The Act foresees a situation in which professional experience completed in another field of specialization may be included in the specialised education of a doctor, provided that its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational programme.
Theoretically, it would be possible to take into account the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the interviewer's situation.
However, with regard to the fact that I do not know the more detailed circumstances of this case, it is advisable to consult the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (Department of Science and Medical Professions), as the Ministry of Health by law provides advisory and consulting services related to inclusion in specialized education and its course.
The advisory service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, of which every doctor must be a member.
Doctors from the syrian Halabu ask for the intervention of the US.
The United States has made no effort to end the siege (of the rebel-held parts of the city) by government troops and has not used its influence to enforce the protection of civilians, the letter to the White House quoted AFP as saying.
"We don't need tears, compassion, or even prayers; however, we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over eastern Aleppo to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab is not surrounded again," the doctors said.
Russian forces, which support the army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, have announced that from today they will stop strikes in the Aleppo region for three hours every day to allow the safe passage of humanitarian convoys.
From 09:00 to 12:00 CEST, all military activities, air attacks and artillery fire are to be stopped.
The UN's chief humanitarian operations, Stephen O'Brien, welcomed the move, but stressed the need for at least a two-day ceasefire.
According to AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors who work in the rebel-held eastern part of Aleppo have addressed Obama in a letter.
They write that during the five-year war they witnessed the violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world looks on and notes how complex Syria is, but does little to protect us.
Recent offers to evacuate the population from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like thinly veiled threats, pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors have noted.
Doctors said 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria had been recorded in the past month, including 15 on the hospitals where they work.
What saddens us most is that we have to decide who will live and who will die.
Young children come to the emergency room with such serious injuries that we have to choose among them those who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the necessary material to help them, doctors described.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when an explosion cut off the supply of oxygen to their incubators.
They gasped for breath and then their lives ended - before it could really begin, they recalled.
The army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russian forces, in recent weeks surrounded the rebel-controlled eastern part of Aleppo, inside found themselves without food supplies over 200,000 people.
The rebels, who are under constant strikes from the Russian and Syrian air forces, managed to break the encirclement and launch a counteroffensive on Saturday after three weeks.
Both sides then added reinforcements in the city and its surroundings.
