The Prague Stock Exchange fell into the negative at the end of trading
After the morning sharp drop, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares amounted to almost half of the normal daily trade.
Right from the beginning of Tuesday's trading, the Prague Stock Exchange continued its Monday drop, falling by almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in stocks on Wall Street.
Even in our country, the market reaction to the result of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to support the plan to stabilize the local financial sector, is reflected.
Stock Crash in Asia
Stocks on stock exchanges in Asia experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indices eventually erased some of their losses during the day.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Hang Seng index lost nearly four percent in trading, but later erased some of its losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell 3.8 percent, while markets were closed in Shanghai.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually reduced losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock market in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent, according to the country's index.
"The timing of the U.S. bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world," said Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong's monetary office.
Hong Kong, although part of China, sets monetary policy on its own, i.e. without dependence on the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates on par with the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said U.S. lawmakers should quickly return to negotiations and approve the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, he said, there is a risk that other countries will feel the impact.
US Stock Bloodbath
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, on which up to $ 700 billion (almost CZK 12 trillion) was supposed to be spent.
Lawmakers ignored President George W. Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks suffered a bloodbath on Monday, with major stock indexes posting their biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones fell by almost seven percent and last recorded a drop of similar magnitude in 1987.
The index was already falling before the vote, but as soon as it became clear that the bill did not pass in the House, the index went into free fall.
Congress backtracks: U.S. government can pump $700 billion into banks
Top officials in the US Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of a financial assistance agreement for the US financial system.
It will be voted on early next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks to approve a rescue plan in the form of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion crowns) in financial assistance for the U.S. financial system.
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must finalize some details of the agreement before they can release the final version of the bill and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be debated on the floor of the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
The Senate could vote on the plan probably not until Wednesday at the earliest, according to sources.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be approved should be the first major psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
But then there will be a "disillusionment" due to the complexity of the mechanisms by which to help markets achieve it in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our differences of opinion on what the market stabilization package should look like," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
She said the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met with US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to finalise the government fund.
It should buy unsaleable mortgage assets from financial companies, which drag financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue with the recovery plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Signal for Asian trading
The global financial crisis has had a significant impact on stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors from trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone where a congressional decision could affect Monday's trading.
But it is not yet clear when both houses of the US Congress will vote on the bill, or whether last-minute negotiations might stall on an issue.
Lawmakers hope it will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount allocated to assistance to the scheme is to be divided into two parts.
An initial $350 billion is to be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George W. Bush.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program is not doing its job, in a succession of another $100 billion and later a final $350 billion.
Bush praised progress in negotiations
The president can veto the decision, but Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, the program's basic idea, which was to raise funds to buy back bad mortgage securities that have plummeted in value because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgages, remained.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated "a bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitations of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said lawmakers agreed on accountability for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing relief, timing funding the plan.
The new law also aims to restrict so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and establishes a committee to supervise the fund.
This should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We've worked very this and we've made great progress toward a deal that works and is useful to the market and to all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also counts on assistance for homeowners who have repayment problems.
The government should negotiate new payments on the mortgages it buys in order to reduce the monthly cost of repayments for borrowers and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to David Marek, chief economist of Patria Finance, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"This is because it is not known by what mechanism and at what price the troubled assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government will divide the losses between them," Marek told news server iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or early next week is not so important, according to Mark.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree this week that they support this plan and that they will approve it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement to approve it is the most important at the moment," Marek emphasized.
The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, together they have 29 percent
According to the first preliminary results, Sunday's early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a significant weakening of both parties of the grand coalition and a significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly heavy losses, with the position of current chairman Wilhelm Molterer seriously shaking.
On the other hand, the election leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Carinthian governor Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the Social Democrats (SPÖ) remain the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, but have lost 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last election in 2006.
Even worse was the ÖVP, which lost almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of both of these big parties in Austria's post-war history, and especially for the People's Party, which triggered the early elections, a disastrous result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP withdrew from the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable lead over the SPÖ in preferences.
But voters apparently punished them for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there was speculation about the possible resignation of the party chairman and current Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe this could happen as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party bureau.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the still most likely outcome of the election outcome, the renewal of the SPÖ-ÖVP grand coalition.
However, due to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ) provisionally won 18 percent and the BZÖ eleven percent of the vote - the Social Democrats also expressed fears of a repeat of 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at that time the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) on a joint government, which even provoked sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already declared that he is ready to cooperate with any party and expects to return to national politics in Vienna, is apparently betting on this development.
The Green Party also entered parliament, but lost slightly and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
Apparently, none of the other parties crossed the four percent threshold and did not get into parliament.
Battle on a knife's edge: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
From this it seems clear that it is better to buy just a phone.
Still, there are enough reasons to get a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the demands of the future owner.
It's hard to get a top-notch expensive turntable to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
On the one hand, such musical products are not released on LPs and, from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason for this.
However, if your shelves are crammed with vinyl with art rock, jazz or blues, you probably dream of such a turntable.
It's the same with music on the go, i.e. compressed music, simply - music in MP3.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For someone it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan will hardly try headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Battery life is also decisive
Some top music players can do much more than just play music, but what most mobiles do not even happen to.
No current device is as versatile as a phone.
In addition to primary functions, phone calls and texting, it can play music and video, record both, has a better camera, a worse camera and can even navigate.
And when you think about smartphones and communicators, you'll even have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a small miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV can photograph anything.
The versatility of the mobile also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the sooner the indicator on the display will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy guzzlers.
Few mobile phones can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, usually it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap mobiles, therefore, count on the fact that they will not play for more than a few hours.
If you still call every now and then, get one more charger for work - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you will not have this problem, even the worse ones can withstand at least 9 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem occurs when recording music on mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector, and not every one of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly to a memory card, but only a few card readers can handle miniature memory cards that are used in mobile phones without reduction.
With some exceptions (iPod), you do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and players already create a music library sorted by artist name, album title, genre or user rating.
Some devices display only a tree structure of directories similar to Explorer in Windows, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Players are easier to operate, mobile phones are more capable
When choosing a particular device, be particularly interested in the battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output and, of course, the comfort of control.
If music is primarily a backdrop for you and you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram, all you need is any mobile phone that plays MP3.
Which can really almost any mobile.
You don't even have to keep track of what music formats your mobile phone or player can do.
MP3s can handle everyone, and the vast majority of music that reaches you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widespread and the vast majority of devices can also handle music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit the relevant website of the operator (or other provider) via the mobile Internet and buy the song or album.
This service alone could be a compelling argument for buying a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is lousy and is mostly limited to quick-fermented radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry a mobile phone with them all the time.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you can feel your phone in your pocket while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least wired hands-free.
If not, you can use the integrated speaker that almost every mobile has, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of music mobiles for many will be the price.
The cheapest ones are usually under three thousand.
For three and four thousand crowns you will get a very decent walkman.
Mostly, however, you will be limited by the absence of an output to conventional headphones.
The best and technically most equipped phones with a 3.5 mm jack for common headphones cost up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, easy operation.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can be controlled by everyone.
The minimum of functions, similarity of control with a previously common cassette recorder or gramophone is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of accidentally turned on mobile internet and subsequently a giant bill for data transfer.
What device to reach for
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for removable memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the appropriate card, you will fit into two thousand crowns.
But beware.
On base models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive ones can handle 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriveru.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are a more demanding listener, reach for specialized mobiles - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of operation is close to a separate MP3 player.
The furthest in the field is Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles from the Walkman series have the same user interface as separately sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours), will take you MP3 players from the above-mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively mature and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we are missing something here - a virtual operator that would force the classic ones to become cheaper.
Maybe he will not be missing for long.
We have written about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe many times on Mobil.cz.
This was confirmed by the CTO, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
After the latest steps taken by the European Commission in the field of roaming fee regulation, a paradoxical situation may arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to go into battle.
It may sound paradoxical, after all, we have three mobile networks and penetration well over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvořák, the Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunication Office (CTO), who has said several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic, often echoes in this.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network probably does not have much chance (after all, it would be difficult to find frequencies).
But there is one more option - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought a significant reduction in prices, to which even conventional operators had to respond.
At the same time, even before the entry of pikes such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, similar voices were heard in the UK as in our country.
But it turned out that there is a place for such operators and they can be really successful.
After all, we don't have to look too far for examples.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, the operator managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator.
Mobilking is backed by the Penta financial group, which owns, among other things, U:fona in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to be able to operate effectively, they need far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not entail relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators usually profile themselves as low-cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS, but this is often balanced by a narrower range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on a fresh target group can also be quite a good move.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
"The right guys are voting for Mobilking — an operator they like and trust," says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which operates the virtual carrier.
It is hard to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could catch on in our country.
Miroslav Čepický, spokesman for Vodafone, doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach on which most virtual operators are based.
Moreover, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offerings."
No chance in the Czech Republic, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look very promising.
Rather, Mobilking will be launched in other countries in our region," Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group, said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything so that no potential competitor arises.
The GTS Novera Group has long been interested in launching a virtual mobile operator, and would like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor to Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We are very interested in being able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this option with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already managed to advance negotiations with some of them," says Pavel Kaidl, the group's spokesperson.
So maybe better times are ahead.
From unofficial information, it seems that we should see the first virtual operator perhaps by the end of the year.
For now, however, its emergence is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room for a full-fledged virtual operator on the Czech market.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by any entity with a comprehensive and serious project in this area," said Vlastimil Sršeň from Telefónica O2's Press Department in a statement to Mobil.cz.
The specificity of the Czech market is also referred to by other operators.
Martina Kemrova, spokesperson for T-Mobile, adds in rare agreement with O2's statement: "So far, we have not seen any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which it would be possible to build further."
He adds: "It will be difficult for a virtual operator to appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this point, we would need to have a concrete agreement on the table to think in this short term."
Vodafone focuses its attention more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the most beneficial from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities - one hand with operators
The actions of mobile operators are easy to understand, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, lead to a drop in prices and thus to a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor to get onboard?
The fact that operators are interested in something, they can pull together is also evidenced by the scramble around the creation of U:fon.
Perhaps the greatest pressure towards the CTO came at the time of the creation of U:fona from T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the CTU website.
But now U:fon is useful as an argument for not allowing a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrova commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been enhanced by the entry of a fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another player would place high demands on it and, above all, on its services."
Given this approach of mobile operators, however, the complete lack of interest of the Czech regulatory authorities is striking.
This is not just about the position of the CTO, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Great Britain and other developed countries - does not have the powers to interfere in competition.
These belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS).
But he took his typical stance on the whole issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after a contract has been concluded between the mobile operator and the virtual operator on the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential bidders was probably not interesting enough for classic operators," said Kristián Chalupa from the External Relations Department of the Office for the Protection of Competition.
This statement will not come as a surprise from the operators' representatives.
This is more than a matter of concern from an authority that is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses their market position.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual operators normally operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in prices for mobile telephone services."
Apparently, however, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and the drop in prices are not among the interests of the Office.
What is truly shocking about the whole case is the touching harmony of the three mobile operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is self-explanatory.
Just as the exact same price of petrol at petrol stations is certainly just a matter of chance and fierce competition.
"The Office has not found signs of anti-competitive conduct in this matter and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore does not have correspondingly increased responsibility for its conduct on the market.
The telecommunications regulator probably also lacks the necessary tools to open the mobile market for virtual operators," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of market dominance is one of many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets prepared by the CTO, according to which telecommunications are a single market from the point of view of competition.
Of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the creation of a virtual operator always requires the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator - quite logically - has a monopoly on its network.
So in a certain segment it must necessarily be dominant.
However, even if we do not allow this argumentation, it should be at least a warning for the Office for the Protection of Competition that three mobile operators are proceeding strikingly similarly.
However, complaints from a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in dealing with all operators.
Shifting responsibility to the CTO is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, by which the Office for the Protection of Competition keeps its hands off the whole matter.
We have already encountered him in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, until the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, the extension of the CTU's powers to the area of competition in telecommunications was not pushed through, although many experts expected it to improve the situation.
The representatives of the Office for the Protection of Competition must know this more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It's possible when no one is looking
At the same time, the functioning of some pseudo-virtual operators, of which there are several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile phone services, but they are only partially public.
Usually, these are companies engaged in multilevel marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the chosen ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts to the operator as a classic business customer who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a major customer, he will receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale resale.
"If there were cases you are talking about, it could be a breach of contractual terms that we would deal with and could result in termination of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemrova replied to our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that similar activity would not reach the responsible people from mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators is opposed to such a procedure.
They make considerable profits from the activities of these companies and at the same time - unlike real virtual operators - they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone is not in their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it as regular customers of mobile operators."
But that should be at least strange for the CTO.
In addition, another question opens up for the Office for the Protection of Competition.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to this, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the Office for the Protection of Competition has relatively strong powers to detect such activity, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the operators' explanation that they have no idea about anything like this and their business conditions prohibit it.
When we will not be the most expensive
As has been mentioned several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a noticeable drop in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where virtual operators were established, conventional operators tried to more or less prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small or too saturated market, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was precisely at these moments that regulators intervened, defending not the interests of mobile operators, but of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, they then achieved that the first virtual operator was created and others piled on top of it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are tossing the whole case around like a hot potato.
From our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that the lack of clarity in competences is more than useful in these cases.
But let's not throw a flint into the rye.
If the behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator will appear in our country really soon, the Czech mobile market may move again.
If one of the operators has admitted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the Office for the Protection of Competition will hardly be able to remain indifferent to rejecting (discriminating) other interested parties.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to four performances of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Day of Czech Statehood, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek ceremonially introduced new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj.
The anthem was newly recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the leadership of Jiří Bělohlávek.
Four versions are available - with male or female solo singing, choral rendition and instrumental version.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka sang the vocals.
The authors of the arrangements of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful anthems.
He has previously told Czech Radio that he deliberately chose singers with young, representative voices that are distinctive and popular to sing solo variants.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that both of them, and then also with the choir, that they had clear diction, that the text was well understood, that they resonated," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj (Where Is My Home) was first heard in 1834 on the boards of the Estates Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by František Škroup.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously embraced it.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the national anthem after the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
What the "new" anthem sounds like
Prague's public transport will ride on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, 1 October 2008 will go down in the history of the Prague Public Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses and will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At the moment, about one hundred thousand people who own an Opencard chip card can buy it.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day and annual coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have it uploaded to their chip card at the information centres and workplaces of the Transport Company at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Since yesterday, coupons can also be purchased over the Internet on the website of the www.dpp.cz Public Transit Company.
The service was used by over four hundred customers in the afternoon.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget about the dispensing windows in metro stations, where they had to regularly stand in long queues for paper tickets.
They buy the coupon over the Internet and upload it to their Opencard at one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
"At these locations, passengers are provided with a counter with trained staff, which will help those interested with online shopping and also upload the purchased coupon to their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to upload electronic coupons to Opencard in self-service vending machines that are installed in several metro vestibules.
What do such slots look like?
They are red, resemble ticket markers, and passengers may have already noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"Now there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrný added.
The coupon will check the driver's place automatic
The operation of the vending machines that will start working tomorrow is simple.
Just insert the Opencard chip card into them and the previously paid coupon will load itself onto it.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
That is, on suburban trains and bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, which go to the capital mainly by residents of Central Bohemian municipalities.
"On trains included in the Prague Integrated Transport, conductors are equipped with card readers to determine the time and zone validity of coupons," explained Filip Drápal from the Ropid organization, which compiles Prague public transport timetables.
Suburban buses have card readers built into the driver's ticket office.
When boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but it is also necessary to attach the Opencard to the designated place on the side of the cash register.
This will check the validity of the uploaded coupons.
"If a passenger needs to verify the validity of the uploaded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," added Drápal.
Passengers who do not travel on suburban buses and do not remember when their coupon expires can go back to self-service machines, where coupons are loaded on the card.
Here, information about the validity of their documents is displayed on the device's display.
Sudetenland wanted a referendum from the US
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans asked for the Šumava to be incorporated into the United States.
This follows from a letter that is deposited in the collections of the South Bohemian Research Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans reportedly turned to the President of the USA with such a wish.
This is evident, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now deposited in the collections of the South Bohemian Research Library.
In a letter, the Germans from Český Krumlov ask the American president not to allow the "Šumava county" - seized by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want to be sure that American troops are coming to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," reads the letter, signed "People who care about the fate of Šumava."
Since the annexation to Czechoslovakia allegedly gives the Sudeten Germans - knowing the Czech national character - hope only for brutality, ruthlessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protectorate over Šumava for present and eternal times.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would cede this territory to a state foreign to us, which oppresses and uproots minorities and has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign their name is allegedly the fear of the revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president allegedly doubted the thinking of the Šumava Germans, it was enough for him to hold a referendum in the Šumava county on whether its inhabitants wanted to become part of the USA or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a bit naïve given today's knowledge of post-war history, according to some eyewitnesses, it aptly illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Although the Czech Germans must have at least suspected that their expulsion from the republic would take place, only a few of them even admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
During the war, as a German from České Budějovice, he was deployed to the navy in the Baltic.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and placed him in a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, Czech would come in handy," Chalupa said.
According to him, none of the German prisoners of war living in Czechoslovakia before the war expected to be expelled from the republic on the basis of the Beneš Decrees.
Don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive event focused on road safety in Czech history.
Even so, one could characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček hopes that it will deter drivers from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and drinking alcohol behind the wheel.
And also to remind them to buckle up before they leave.
He wants to reach into the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what will appear in the spots?
Mainly human stories that attack emotions.
And this is evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
Don't think - you pay!
The word "don't think" is written in capital letters on the espézetka.
And in the pool of blood is the word "you will pay."
This is supposed to symbolize that a person can pay for a moment of inattention with his own life.
Viewers will be "scared" by the spots until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where it is common to see pictures with drastic pictures of accident victims.
He hopes that this will reduce the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Carrot and stick to the driver
"There is a carrot-and-stick system for drivers.
Sugar for them is that when they go to a red light, for example, they save time.
A whip is the threat of a fine or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořán, a traffic psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
That is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are needed, says the psychologist.
Less effective, he says, are signs that warn drivers of danger.
"If a static sign is installed warning of danger, it will probably soon merge with the surroundings and drivers will not pay attention to it," Koran warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israel's interim prime minister, Ehud Olmert, has called for the return of virtually all of the territories occupied in 1967, including Transjordan, East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published by the Yediot Ahronot newspaper on Monday.
"We have to come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that almost all (occupied) territories will have to be returned, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to cede a similar percentage (of Israeli territory) to the Palestinians, because without that there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem, and especially doesn't want tractors or bulldozers to run over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert said, referring to two July attacks in the city in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, sacred and historical sites" that lie within the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That won't work," he stressed.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert also called for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said is an indispensable condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of leaving the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah; they will have to give up the continued support they provide to the terrorism of Hamas, al-Qaeda and jihad (holy wars) in Iraq," he said.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool down
If the problem with Czech scientists, who were accused of illegal collecting beetles in India, could not be resolved, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, Czech-Indian relations would cool somewhat.
The minister made the remarks in New York after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee today.
"If it was not resolved, then yes, then there would be a certain cooling," he said after the meeting, which took place on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the hearing that the executive branch could hardly interfere in judicial matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government in Darjeeling, within whose jurisdiction the case falls.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kucera, sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherjee said it would be best for him to appeal to a higher court.
He can then apply for bail and await sentencing, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed the same opinion during the negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way for the Czech side to intervene in the matter is to provide "competent legal support" to the convicts, the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such assistance is already provided by the Indian side.
"We are most interested in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
Indians also recognize this," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told the Czech News Agency, he emphasized to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We consider it a profound mistake to imprison and indict these Czech scientists," he said.
The minister avoided answering the question of whether he had received a promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter.
"I've received quite a few promises," he said only.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, walking in a long-distance bus is not allowed
The tragic accident involving a Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, has raised the question of whether stewards and passengers can move around the bus while driving.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the steward's activity is contrary to the Road Traffic Act," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident that killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardess last week was apparently caused by a truck driver who crossed the path of the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, although she has two other seats reserved.
However, the bus can crash or brake sharply, even when the steward is delivering coffee or newspapers.
The role is played by whether the bus is equipped with standing places according to the technical certificate.
If the bus is not homologated, passengers must be seated.
Student Agency coaches do not have standing spaces; which was Aktuálně.cz confirmed by the director of the company, Radim Jančura.
"We discussed this with the ministry and at first it did not allow the movement of passengers.
Later they called it off and we came to the conclusion that passengers are allowed to go to the toilet while driving, as long as they have their seat," he said.
The law does not know the steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the steward's role – no legislation addresses that role.
However, no legal regulation prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term conductor of vehicles; it does not define its rights and obligations," adds Hanzelka's spokesperson less clearly.
On the other hand, Josef Pokorný, Director of the Department of Road Vehicles Operation of the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law adequately addresses the issue.
"It depends on whether the bus is allowed standing in the homologation.
That's the end of it," he says.
Buses are divided into urban buses, with standing places and maximum speed limits, interurban buses with standing places with a higher speed limit, and long-distance buses without standing places with a speed limit and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like an airplane, says expert
BESIP traffic safety expert Jaroslav Hořín does not see a major problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"There are not many dangers during smooth driving, the situation can be compared to servicing in airplanes.
Even here, it's uncertain when the turbulence will come and the flight attendant may hit her head."
"However, if the bus brakes sharply, of course the laws of physics apply.
Just like in a city bus or tram.
The safety of stewards must be dealt with by the carrier by internal regulations," he says, and also thinks that from the point of view of the law, the issue is unresolved.
Jancura is willing to cancel the services
Student Agency offers steward services as the only bus company.
It employs two hundred of them.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their profession to be risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the profession of stewards is risky, I cancel them.
Coffee and newspapers can be given to passengers upon boarding.
It would also save costs," he says.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asiana, Alexei Litvin, which operates a fraction of the routes compared to SA, justified the absence of stewards in his cars.
"We don't have stewardesses, we've been against that from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in some kind of fatal accident," he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
An immense tragedy has happened
A young stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the company for two years, died in an accident on a regular service to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably veered out of the side lane without using the turn signal and blocked the path of the bus.
His driver tried to avoid the abrupt manoeuvre, but hit it with the right front.
Jančura denies that two places reserved for the stewards' rests would be sold out.
"These places cannot be reserved on long-distance services, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
With compensation for the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the verdict of the court, but financial compensation is also expected from the culprit.
Amendment of the law?
Not in sight
Clarification of the movement of stewards on board the bus could be brought by an amendment to the law, on which a thirty-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"However, it did not come to any concrete conclusion.
Buses don't even care much, but rather the points system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of a mobile phone while driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of stewards to be something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," concludes spokesman Hanzelka, adding that checking the safety of buses is within the competence of the police and occupational safety authorities.
Czech judges the fight for the seabed
They proceed to a wall-mounted electronic map showing Australia and adjacent marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as big as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of thirty members of the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and Law of the Sea.
His boss, the division director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and occasionally adds to it.
There is enthusiasm and enthusiasm for work.
The seabed hides a hitherto little-known world, rich in natural resources.
You can find oil, ores and other minerals, but also hitherto unknown living organisms that carry the key to the development of a cure for cancer.
Bottom larger than land
Coastal states have now begun to bid vehemently for new underwater territories.
Under the UN Convention, they are exercising their rights, which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
Under the Convention, the latter has exclusive title to all resources of the continental shelf.
"To put it simply, the continental shelf is that part of the seabed and its subsoil that is a natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the coastal sea, often beyond the two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the delimitation of the external limits of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and technical assistance.
The Commission has so far dealt with five requests, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have succeeded," adds Mikulka.
The success of Australia has recently been the first to substantially expand its underwater possessions.
But he also won New Zealand - the area of seabed granted to him by the commission last week is about 1.6 million square kilometers, roughly six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The future gains from exploiting the seabed will, they promise, be invaluable.
Other States will submit their applications gradually.
They can do so up to ten years after they have ratified the 'UNCLOS'.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, declared by the convention as the "common heritage of mankind".
Here no state has an exclusive position anymore.
The right to exploit in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is no Klondajk," says director Mikulka in exaggeration, adding that his "individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually anchored."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares them with other countries of the former Eastern Bloc within the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, the country, like investors from a few other states, received the status of a so-called "pioneer investor".
It is authorized to mine in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is rugged, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"It is possible to mine on an area totalling 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is rich in polymetallic nodules containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Macedonian division worker Robert Sandev brings one such concretion to the demonstration.
It resembles a small potato or, with a little imagination, the mythical shem that, according to legend, revived the Golem.
Düsseldorf's hope is Frankfurt
The letter from the board of directors of WestLB to the employees of that bank is not lacking in words.
The merger of the Düsseldorf-based financial institution's units with Frankfurt's Deka-Bank will create "the central institution of the savings bank financial group for trading in capital markets," according to a letter leaked to the public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will bring to the transaction a "set of competences" ensuring long-term returns.
In general, such a merger could be a decisive impulse for further associations in the Landesbank sector.
Such texts are created when the Board of Directors wants to demonstrate the ability to act in a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only from the European Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, whose message to the state government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
However, the connection between Deka-Bank, which savings bank customers know for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever it may be, has been talked about for some time - including on the Frankfurt side.
Presenting his six-month financial results at the end of August, the head of Deka-Bank, Franz Waas, said that he did not see the point in merging his Mainzer Landstraße banking house with a Landesbank such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the board of directors of Deka-Bank, half of which is backed by Landesbanks and the other by savings bank associations, has entrusted the board of directors with conducting talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be part or all of the capital market transactions.
But talks have only just begun, the financiers say.
This is not the first time that Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the most important employers on the financial market in Frankfurt, has been mentioned in connection with consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it looked for a while that Deka-Bank might merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba Bank.
In the end, nothing came of this triple alliance.
Shortly after the merger plans became public, the Hessian provincial government opposed the participation of Helaba Bank.
Not even the two remaining banking houses merged.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead acquired Landesbank Baden-Württemberg of Stuttgart.
Despite this, there was repeated speculation about a merger between Deka-Bank and the Landesbanks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba Bank, commented negatively on speculation about the merger of his financial house with others.
Independently of this, however, the conviction seems to be maturing that bringing the various public-sector banking houses closer together is a necessity.
Now that the Landtag elections in Bavaria have taken shape, BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first to take shape.
That's not good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers should increase, it will gradually lose potential partners for such a merger.
In the south, it would only play second fiddle, even though it has so far faced the financial crisis significantly better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The merger with WestLB was banned at the beginning of the year by the Hessen-Thüringen Savings Banks and Giro Banks, which has an eighty-five percent stake in Helaba.
At most, Nord LB could therefore be considered.
But geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much the business models of individual institutions fit together.
In June, Merl said that the German Association of Savings Banks and Giro Banks had not yet answered the crucial question of what business model should ensure the future competitiveness of the Landesbanks.
It could also end up with the dismantling of WestLB, which of course no one in this institution wants.
That is why the letter of the local board of directors says that they are trying to find a "comprehensive solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect this with the interconnection of individual components with Deka-Bank, time will tell.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "weekend with the Italians"
For Elena, it's the first time, for Luca it's the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena will be there as his girlfriend, so everything will be different, he says.
Behind them, at a five-litre Kaiser barrel, stands a thicker bearded man, proving to the two hundred tourists at Oktoberfest how deep his throat can give.
Elena first slaps Luca and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus car park next to Puorta Nuova station, four buses marked "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra" will depart at 11.45pm this evening, expected to arrive at 6.30am.
Three buses are occupied mainly by Italians, one bus is driven exclusively by Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, they were already celebrating at night.
And this loud, says Marco Guarda, it's not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with imitation fur lining and wide-rimmed silver-rimmed glasses, owns the three buses.
He has been going with them to Oktoberfest for five years, this year alone he organizes three expeditions.
At night there, during the day between beer stalls, at 22.30 departure back.
An overnight stay would only mean unnecessary costs, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros including a welcome toast with Kaiser beer, brewed exactly according to the Bavarian law on beer purity, health insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco was taking a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses leave into the night, along the autostrada towards "Brennero".
Beer is not served, not yet.
The bus quickly falls silent, the passengers are asleep.
They are doing well, they will still need their strength.
They stop in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where many other buses with Italian number plates take another stop on motorway 8 just outside Munich.
When Marc's group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half past seven in the morning, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives one last speech, explaining the plan of attack.
First: Put on a yellow cap.
On it is written 'Oktoberfest' on the left, and next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: 'conoscersiviaggiando.it'.
Second: "When the door to the beer tent opens, run!" calls Marco into the morning air.
"Go!" Go and occupy the seats at the back of the tent.
"Not forward, so as not to get in the way, and not all yellow caps on the same benches, spread out in space!"
Maz costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget to tip.
"Show the security guards that we behave.
As soon as you leave your seats, they are gone!"
Third: "Be here again tonight at exactly half-past eleven!" Understand?
And up to Wiesn, an area with beer tents.
Along the way, a member of the group hangs yellow caps as signs on trees, signs and even on an election poster of a large Bavarian party.
It is necessary to prepare for retreat.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "weekend with the Italians".
Exact data on the number of visitors are not available; Fifty thousand are said to be making their way across the Alps and storming beer tents, ten per cent of all visitors this weekend are said to have arrived from Italy.
Seven police officers from South Tyrol will join the ranks of the Munich police, while Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which keeps national statistics in which Italians rank first ahead of the British (about 60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical treatments.
The Hofbräu tent is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Lenders
As recently as last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system was relatively stable.
It is good that this politician used the word "relatively" and intertwined with the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared from the crisis.
Because that happened last weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), a financial house monitored by the Dax index, will receive a multi-billion dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect against market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan assistance would go up to 35 billion euros.
Interest will have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only on the amount actually spent.
The money is said to come from private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
According to a newspaper report, the state financier refinanced himself for long-term projects for which he lent money in the extreme short term, which is no longer possible due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve shrunk by 95% to €2.37 million, and the equity ratio also fell slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the previous year, while income from the increased value of claims and certain securities, as well as from the cancellation of provisions for credit trading, fell by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
It was only thanks to higher yields from compensation for subsequent settlement costs in the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and from interest compensation under the Tax Code and for intermediation of business for group companies that the sixteen percent decrease in revenues was even more moderate.
After his privatization in 1990, the former state financier burned himself on mortgages for sole traders, which were then separated from the portfolio of services and further managed by Aareal Bank.
Because there was too little to earn in traditional state financing, Depfa was more involved in infrastructure projects and private-public-partnership (PPP) financing and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate must now write off some of its subsidiary's value, and these write-downs will have a "substantial material effect" on the group's profit and loss calculation, as some have vaguely said.
The fact is that the dividend will not.
Already for 2007, it was cut by two-thirds.
Since the takeover of Depf, Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier in state and infrastructure projects.
More strongly than other institutes, it depends on refinancing in the interbank market, since it has no customer deposits.
After the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the spring of interbank credit has virtually dried up, because banks guard liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds annually for part of Depfa's loan portfolio - about EUR 50 billion.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financial needs are covered by this loan for the foreseeable future and the company is protected "from the influence of international money markets currently largely unable to function".
Other sources have said that this money ensures refinancing by the end of 2009.
On the other hand, HRE Chairman Georg Funke said that Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to use the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Federal Institute for Financial Supervision (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate group on the market is now assured.
That is what the bank's shareholders and creditors are hoping for.
But given the dynamics and elusiveness of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even completely excluded that the loan would not need to be fully drawn.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the bank appeared to face insolvency late on Sunday afternoon, even a preliminary bailout will not be able to calm passions.
The share price fell by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, bond rates held up well.
While senior debt has barely moved, secondary bond rates are losing more significantly.
This applies in particular to bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, logically, bonds maturing after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate bonds originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability must be understood depending on the stability of the international financial system after the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which brought it to the company by taking over Depf.
As long as banks of issue, governments, and less-affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, securities can be counted on to be paid by their maturity date.
But it may also happen what almost no one dares to hope for at the moment: the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
But, given the news coming at the same time as this partial nationalization, a probability bordering on certainty has now become a legitimate hope.
This is likely to give long-term creditors a series of sleepless nights to decide whether to give up their obligations.
At the very least, short-term investors can use the cut-off line to convert losses from previous financial years to exchange income of later years for the purpose of future capital gains tax payments.
German special operations units were liberated by hostages
The Egyptian government has asked for help from Germany in resolving the hostage crisis - experts have arrived.
When the situation escalated, special forces were prepared, but there was no deployment.
More details of the circumstances surrounding the liberation of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are gradually coming to light.
According to the Defense and Interior Ministries, German special forces also indirectly participated in the rescue operation.
According to the ministries, both experts of the Federal Army and members of the anti-terrorist group of the German police GSG9, squadrons of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk) were at the scene.
According to another statement from spokesmen for both ministries on Monday afternoon, however, there was no need for German forces because the kidnappers let their captives go and fled when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government reportedly accepted the assistance offered by Germany as a support force for action on the ground.
"Fortunately, this did not happen," said one spokesman for the Federal Interior Ministry.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, as well as eight of their Egyptian guides on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After being kidnapped in a desert region in southern Egypt, hostages were moved in border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as details of the release or possible ransom payment.
At present, the rescued are safe in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said the freed hostages were in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
There is no information yet available in Berlin on when the rescued will return to Germany.
According to Bild, all five tourists and special forces are expected to fly in one of the German Air Force's Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secret of the bento box
When sixteen-year-old Sylvana Hiltropová is about to introduce herself on her first day at high school in Tachibana, the girls start chuckling: the German woman is completely "kawaii"!
What does this mean?
Sylvana knows this word from manga. On his new exchange blog, he talks about Japan.
"First day in Japan.
Lord, I was nervous.
I was already chased from the way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and travel 40 minutes by train to high school in Tachibana.
I had to find the way myself, fortunately I did not get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not as strict as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin to meet after eight o'clock, and twenty minutes before nine o'clock begins a short sitting with the teacher, the so-called 'home room'.
But before class began, I was supposed to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, let alone in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have a school uniform yet, I wore my host mother's old skirt, plus a blouse, blue knee socks, and black leather shoes.
Dressed in this way, I stood in front of the bench and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sajónara Wo še Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that moment, I was very glad that I started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were whispering, giggling and waving, and I could still hear the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly sailed into my seat.
The girl next to me smiled quite broadly, considering it an honor that a foreign student should be sitting next to her.
The rest of the class was relatively quiet, but when the gong sounded, they literally showered me.
They talked over each other and giggled and asked me about the possible and the impossible - and it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone unpacked their bents.
My host mum also made me a lunch box – and that's different from boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber and algae salad, fruit and some fish in tofu batter.
Most of the time, I have no idea what exactly I eat here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
What is certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except perhaps the salt-laden plums, Br!
Benths in Japanese schools are not just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a boy a self-made bento, which in this case is particularly artistically arranged, and hopes to get to know the boy better during a snack during the break.
I've read about this in my manga comics.
I wonder if I'll see it here too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
'Because I'm just fascinated by it.'
After all, I've loved reading mangoes for years.
And to better understand these comics and their culture, I started learning a little Japanese.
So it was very clear to me that I would have to come here one day.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And these are highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
U.S. House of Representatives rejects bailout package
The first chamber of the US Congress narrowly dropped a $700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
Suddenly, the Dow Jones index fell sharply.
By a vote of 206 to 227, the US House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for a program to ease the turmoil in financial markets.
With dramatic action, proponents were desperate to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, called on MPs to give their assent before the vote, although he said the plan was not popular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened before," he acknowledged.
During the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason was investors' fears that the state rescue package could fail.
Shortly before the end of voting, the value of the index rose, only to fall sharply again after the announcement of the collapse of the package.
Experts are now counting on further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
Both the House and Senate approval is required for the program to take effect.
Even rats have feelings
When a rat or a cockroach runs away from danger, does this mean that they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux believes that many animals have feelings.
But how can it be verified whether they feel the same way when they behave like us?
In the Internet journal "Edge" for several years have been published contributions of well-known scientists.
In his series, SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you consider true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it yet, when we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
But as soon as we begin to devote ourselves to another kind and open up questions of perception or consciousness in general, we enter impassable terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it will do what many other animals do: pretend to be dead, flee or attack.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists infer comparable subjective experiences.
However, I do not believe in that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
This is partly because the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always involve the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its contribution to short-term memory and performance or control functions).
This vast area is significantly more developed in humans than in other primates, and seems to be completely absent in other creatures.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them knowing who we are and the ability to plan and make decisions, there is reason to believe that humans are different even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity might be hidden in the linguistic nature of man: because so much of his perception is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, we could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, surely language would influence it, so that animal consciousness, however constructed, would probably be different from most states of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to find out what consciousness looks like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor analyzed on the basis of our own experience because of special hardware, it presents us with great problems in examining it.
Most of my conclusions relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to study processes in animal consciousness regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in short-term memory studies in primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But this approach, pursued by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses on neural correlates of consciousness rather than causal mechanisms: the two may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the non-frontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What does this imply for feelings?
I infer them from the fact that an emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in the brain conscious of its own activity.
What we refer to as "fear" is the mental state we find ourselves in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as bodily reactions) uses operational memory.
Seen from this angle, feelings are closely related to those areas of the cortex that characterize primates, and humans in particular.
In connection with linguistic nature, a subtle gradation of perception arises, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize states in order to attribute them to others alongside ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the cortex and brainstem regions dedicated to bodily sensations, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it might well contribute to the feelings perceived by multiple animal species.
Purely theoretically, I cannot contradict this, but I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to us as fear in rats and humans is probably felt equally by both organisms: But how can it be verified, Pankseep says, whether rats and humans feel the same way when they behave in a similar way?
The cockroach flees from danger - does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, mere similarity of behavior cannot prove similarity of experience.
It's true that the neural comparison pushes us further: rats and humans have similar brain stems, while cockroaches don't even have brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if it could be proven in humans: how would we want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how I'm supposed to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness rests on special circuits and language), I study emotional behavior rather than rat emotional perception.
In any case, in this case, we can see progress at the neural level if we measure the same thing in rats and in humans.
As with rats, I do not study language and consciousness, nor do I examine feelings, because I do not know whether they exist.
It may be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than repeatedly throw myself against the wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said preparations would soon be directed directly by the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the European Championship together with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has only just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
Both hosts are lagging behind in the early implementation of the schedule for the construction or redevelopment of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for the European Championship will be reduced from eight to six.
"We have no more time to lose.
We must now work as quickly as possible," said Grigory Surkis, chairman of the Ukrainian union.
"UEFA will be constantly monitoring us."
An even more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish federation PZPN was dismissed by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by an independent administrator, Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Minister of Sport Mirosław Drzewiecki.
He said there was a "serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told Poland's PAP news agency.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer as a result."
Several teams from the first league were only last season due to manipulation condemned to forced relegation, eventually even had to be hastily moved the start of the league.
Travel agents are seeing increasing bookings
It looks like winter will be good for German tourism entrepreneurs:
According to one study, the turnover of holiday bookings for the coming months increased significantly compared to the previous year – by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic growth, Germans' appetite for travel remains undimmed.
For bookings for the winter season, tour operators recorded a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the same period last year, according to the German Travel Association (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to research by the market research institute GfK, increased bookings are already available for the autumn months.
According to DRV, the turnover for October was about eleven percent higher compared to 2007.
These results are based on figures from GfK, which evaluates booking data from 1200 German travel agencies every month and interpolates them into the overall market.
This result included bookings for tours that took place until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak exchange rate of the dollar, trips to the US are especially in demand, DRV said.
For these trips, the increase in bookings is about one-third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters, are particularly desirable targets for the Germans.
Organized tours, in particular, are trending, said DRV chairman Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising costs of energy and food, the costs "are easier for the client to calculate than for an individually organised holiday".
Laepple explained that consumers can save money by taking advantage of early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, among other things.
Even in the summer months, the number of bookings was said to be very good, so there will again be a higher turnover compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
Outraged Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to advertise a new movie, talked about private things in conversation — and now she's in trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan referred to her ex Dennis Quaid as a marriage breaker.
He rages and strikes back.
The belated War of the Roses for ex-married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are engaged in an ugly feud - in the public eye.
In an interview with InStyle magazine last week, Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the collapse of her marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She said she only learned about the extent of the fraud after the divorce.
The impetus for this mental striptease was Ryan's PR work for her new film, "The Women," which tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was striking: It's "crazy," the fifty-four-year-old actor told the New York Daily News that "Meg repeatedly chews through and edits the history of our relationship."
Moreover, it is "regrettable" that their sixteen-year-old son, Jack, is once again "publicly reminded of the pain and radical changes that divorce is for any child."
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
He concludes his reflections on bending as follows: "In any case, my life goes on.
I consider myself fortunate to have an amazing family that is doing great."
Airfare and hotel prices are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even cheaper by up to 50 percent, according to a recent study.
Flights and hotel accommodation have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and, after a rise in prices in the first quarter, found a significant decline in the second quarter.
After several years of rising prices on the hotel market, accommodation has already become cheaper in many places.
Between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
American Express blames this trend on the weak dollar exchange rate, which has caused "a declining appetite for American tourists to travel."
Financial centres such as Hanover, Cologne and Stavanger were also hit harder by the fall in hotel prices.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices even set a European record with a 26.3 percent increase.
Ticket prices also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in the price of kerosene, passengers in economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and fuel-intensive long-haul flights increased by up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, Economy Class fares fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but the changes in Business and First Class were noticeably less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, they grew by 11.9 percent, falling by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
On German domestic flights, according to the study, prices have even fallen by half.
One of the reasons for this price fall is slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalized air traffic between the US and Europe.
The closure of unprofitable routes by air carriers is a sign of the tense situation, as well as the high number of airlines that filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beat Gladbach 1-0
Thanks to one goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the top of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay continues to fail to put together a functioning eleven.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - enlarge Failed landing for representative Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach joined the game late and failed with a poked ball on the stick.
His message was precisely formulated and convincingly came out of his mouth.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," hissed Hermann Rieger in the corridor to the locker rooms of the Hamburg arena.
There wasn't much going on in the catacombs, the break between half-times was over and most people were sitting in their seats again.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades and enjoys more respect than many momentary actors.
And so his plea was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol said yes and gave a thumbs up in a sign of agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order was probably similar: here with the second goal!
Implementation did not take place.
"It wasn't nice to look at everything here today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have "wished it was more relaxed".
The Hamburg team owes 1-0 (1-0) to a header from Mladen Petrić (11th) and the fact that the very weak Gladbashians could not hurt the weak Hamburgians.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
Hamburger SV will celebrate its 121st anniversary this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and a live updated video wall table in which their team was listed as the top performer.
It will be a birthday without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate it," Marcell Jansen said.
He suspects that the running table symbolizes the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petrić and FC Bayern acquired Jansen - is slowly finding itself, but it is not yet able to shine.
"We need more feeling and more dribbling," Jol said emphatically.
My first Oktoberfest
Endlessly repeated pop, beer from tuples and prominent people in folk costumes from famous designers.
First time on a beer meadow.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is blonde, a TV presenter and wears a tailor-made costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing unites us: we're not even three minutes in the beer meadow yet, and photographers are already rushing at us and nimbly filling memory cards - this flatters me, because this is my first time at Oktoberfest.
That's how you can make friends.
My cheap costume seems to have served its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equator, so my sense of comfort in the costume was rather limited.
But right after arriving at the Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone wears a woman's costume or leather trousers; No one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
Only my apron reaps strange glances at the chocolate banana stand.
One Munich woman points out to me that I tied it wrong: "You're free on the left, virgin in the middle, married on the right, widowed in the back."
I secretly flip the bow from back to left.
"Okay," he says, laughing.
Others are less concerned with subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats with the inscription "To drunk to get dressed!" and stick out naked butts at passers-by.
A young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is named Bob, he is from England and he came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He seems to be "gorgeous", with an elongated "ooooo
That's what he tells me after he's relieved himself of the muse he's just drunk.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks are trash cans.
Bob is therefore one of the dreaded "Wildbieslers", as free urination people are called in public in Bavaria.
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight in the evening, paramedics run around the area where Oktoberfest takes place in droves, having to take care of the poor drinkers.
Medics always appear in flocks - in four they carry covered stretchers from tent to tent.
They work as most visitors to a beer meadow: empty there, full back again.
Who lies under the tarpaulin of this coffin of a mille is not seen.
"It's the one that I can't go on," one of the medics calls me in answer to my question and disappears into the crowd.
After defeat in the vote
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
The first reports of the sinking of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones index to fall by up to 700 points.
This was the largest point loss in a single day in its history.
Later, Dow put on some weight.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock market barometer showed a five percent drop to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was down at 1548 points with more than seven percent.
The worst performers in the Dow at this point were American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and Bank of America with a loss of around twelve percent.
None of the titles could strengthen.
Goldman Sachs shares lost nearly ten percent.
Until a few days ago, large-scale investor Warren Buffett had a stake in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called rotten mortgage papers.
However, the entire amount is not to be paid all at once, but in several stages.
In return, the state is to receive stock warrants of financial companies, which could be reimbursed if the exchange rate develops favourably, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock prices in Europe fall sharply
Billions in aid to banks in Europe and the US does not relieve investors of doubts.
The share price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly downward, dragging the Dax index with it.
The US Dow Jones index is losing despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular exchange rate losses by Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank pushed the German Stock Index (Dax) deep into the negative.
The Munich-based real estate financier's shares lost as much as three-quarters of their value despite the rescue of the federal government and private banks, while Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important 6,000 point mark and scored 5,839 points with a minus of 3.7 percent.
All over the world, stock markets went to their knees.
In New York, the trading day on Wall Street began with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion bailout might not be enough to revive financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, in the first hour of trading to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives is due to vote on the rescue plan, with the Senate expected to vote on Oct. 1.
Other European stock exchanges went in only one direction: in London, the FTSE index first fell by 3.2 percent, the CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan's leading Nikkei index fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 units after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, leading Sensex lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, to close at 12,595.75.
In MDAx, Arcandor shares lost after the announcement of the capital increase.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed for 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourism group announced that it would not sell its shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have struggled with a mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during a swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
Due to the fuel lines, which will soon freeze, she is now threatened with death from the cold.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has wreaked havoc among scientists - the gravitational slingshot anomaly.
A gravitational slingshot is an aerial maneuver by space probes in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
Thanks to this, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physics trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
But what has puzzled scientists for years in this case: flying bodies do not behave one hundred percent as one would expect under the good old law of gravity.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
Probes accelerate or decelerate unexpectedly.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They christened it the gravitational slingshot anomaly.
Several experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton remains convinced that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the gravitational slingshot anomaly using so-called dark matter, whose presence in the universe has been detected by astronomers.
"Dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Space explorers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
Obviously, a gravitational force emanates from it, the effect of which on other celestial bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, it itself is completely invisible, which means that it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not even visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, a good fifth of the total mass of the universe is from this dark matter.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their captors, the kidnapped tourists are back at large, according to the Italian Foreign Minister in Egypt.
The kidnappers from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
Six hijackers were reportedly killed in a shootout before his release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
Negotiations on the ransom are reportedly already underway.
The Germans repeatedly become targets for the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists brought to the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arabic television station Al-Arabiya and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports by Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been freed.
We are in the process of verifying their health," Frattini said.
According to a report by Egyptian state television, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are safe and sound.
All 19 participants of the expedition to the desert are apparently already on their way to Cairo.
The background to the shootout before the hostages were released remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the hijackers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed to a ransom," the quoted worker said.
He said "it was just a matter of taking the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot dead six hijackers and captured two of them in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; The money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", citing one of the German intermediaries, reported that the release of the hostages was delayed because the hijackers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after paying a ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Police released the name of the accident victim
The name of a sixty-three-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a car in Essex has been released.
The accident at Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon befell Carole Paulson of Chelmsford Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a fifty-one-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He has already been released on police bail.
Stepfather's abuse 'led to suicide'
Several years of abuse by her stepfather led the woman to kill herself, the court heard.
After pleading guilty to eight counts of sexual harassment, fifty-seven-year-old Michael Trerise, from Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years.
Truro Crown Court heard that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Trerise wrote in his confession.
The court was also told that Miss Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and blindfolded her and then sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 80s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court heard that Miss Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was haunted by the specter of twice-weekly abuse.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that in 2006, friends of Miss Randle, who was also a heavy surfer and cyclist, said she was "emotionally dead" and that she had "given up her life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
She is believed to have suffocated with a plastic bag.
Randle came face to face with his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with the words: "I bound her up and blindfolded her.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Treris: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been horrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she had not done so, the case probably would not have gone to court at all."
"I would particularly like to highlight the consequences that Stephanie's parents believe your crime has had on their daughter over the years."
"Obviously, otherwise she would probably have been a promising, successful, happy young woman."
An official who lost data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top-secret documents on a train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top-secret documents on a train to Waterloo while he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the least serious offence against the said law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
The BBC's defence correspondent Frank Gardner said such a move would come as a surprise to many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the ministry and the Cabinet Office," he said.
An employee who may not be named is charged under section 8.1 of the law in question, which is a clause that deals with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police indict the official based on the very sensitive nature of his work on the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot contained secret analyses of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from his home to an unknown location.
Credit unions face B&B debt
British credit unions may have to deal with more than £80 million in debt after the Bradford & Bingley bailout rescue.
The government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million clients at Bradford & Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all firms that take client deposits, including 59 credit unions.
Credit Union Association (BSA) CEO Adrian Coles said it was "humiliating" that credit unions and their members had to pay.
The fourteen billion dollar debt will eventually be repaid by bailing out the Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest that accumulates in the meantime will be paid each year by all 700 financial firms that take client deposits.
The Money Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that all 59 credit unions are included in this figure.
It is humiliating that these institutions, which behaved prudently... Now they have to pay some of the bills of those institutions that were not nearly as prudent
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each firm should pay in proportion to the deposits it held, and that credit unions should pay about 18% of the price.
The Treasury estimates that interest on debt will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that credit unions will have to find £81 million to pay off the interest from the first year.
Adrian Coles, chief executive of the credit unions trade association, told the BBC he believed it was not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that behaved prudently during the housing boom now have to pay some of the bills of those institutions that were not nearly as prudent."
According to the BSA, no credit union has collapsed since they appeared in 1945.
"We're going to need to look at all aspects of this over the next few weeks to see what options there are to protect credit unions and their members from an account that could be substantial," Cole added.
The interest payable in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest for the whole year will be to be repaid, and it could be almost twice as much.
Since credit unions are mutual organizations without shareholders, this bill will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Turkey's diplomatic horizons are broadening
Long before Turkey began its bid to join the European Union, the European powers longed to penetrate deep into Turkey's backfield.
On the eastern bank of the Bosphorus, perhaps only twenty paces in Asia, stands one of the finest monuments of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
So that's what tourist guides will tell you.
The building sits astride the end of the platforms, with a tower on each corner of the façade, indistinguishable from a provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But once one gets inside the vaulted ticket office, one can no longer doubt the size of the establishment, whose westernmost gate was the station.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, which was late in the game of empires, intended to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East with this railway that would lead to Damascus, Baghdad and on to what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperial ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Their dormitories were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular troops.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone
British and colonial troops advanced out of Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And for the station Hydarpasha also came bad news.
In 1917, an explosion of an ammunition train destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has gradually crumbled and history has bypassed it.
Today, however, this gateway to Anatolia and further east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
Now a new policy is in place - Turkey is engaged.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To examine the parameters of this new policy, I took a night train to the Turkish capital, Ankara, where I was to meet with one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a bumpy ride on rails that recalled the old-world rhythms of the famous Night Mail documentary, I arrived in the Turkish capital, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
It aroused suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and metal building deliberately built in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-finished department stores and power dealerships, where middle managers in business suits – both men and women – meet to do early morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could easily be a centre-right politician from almost any other European political party.
Jacket, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry too.
"The goal of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate surroundings.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he told me.
Turkey was cut off from its backfield.
Today they have to look east and west at the same time.
It was no choice.
It had to do both.
"But surely there will come a time," I asked, "when Turkey may have to make a decision?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not want such a decision to have to be made."
He then emphasized what almost everyone I spoke to said almost by heart: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea area, benefit Europe and the United States as much as Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, travel east to Asia and the Middle East on these rails.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another mostly sleepless night, I thought of the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Cona, who had watched this building being built a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East may now be, in large part, in Turkish hands.
And as I waited at the port for the ferry back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called the "sick man of Europe."
So it seems that, at least then, there was little doubt as to which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
Milk will rise by five pence per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after a twopence price hike in February, and comes after research conducted by a consultancy.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect the price increase in customer prices.
Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Bail for Bangladeshi ex-PM denied
A Bangladeshi court has rejected former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajid's request for bail, meaning she could be arrested if she returns to her homeland.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail in connection with allegations that she had blackmailed over fifty million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several corruption charges brought against her.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina's longtime political rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the local military-held government first give her complete freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was released on her word of honour to undergo medical treatment abroad, it is unclear under the terms of her release whether she will remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal the High Court's order to the Supreme Court.
"The High Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail, saying that she does not need bail since she is already undergoing examinations abroad released on an affidavit," said her lawyer, Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal the High Court's order."
Her lawyers said she needed bail to return to the country from abroad in preparation for the December elections.
A senior People's League official said Sheikh Hasina was to return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after the military-held interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaled Zia both deny all charges against each other.
Fear over polio vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children did not participate in the recent widespread polio vaccination because of violence linked to the Taliban.
The UN carried out vaccinations in six provinces last week.
However, she says she could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
A UN spokesman said this was despite promises by the Taliban not to attack or prevent thousands of vaccine workers from working.
BSkyB loses ITV court case
BSkyB lost a court case for review of a Competition Commission decision ordering it to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously stated that BSkyB's stake had stifled competition and gave the company disproportionate influence over ITV.
BSkyB bought a stake in 2006 in a deal that prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trade Authority announced that BSkyB's acquisition of a stake in ITV had given rise to doubts as to ITV's independence and invited the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
The head of the Virgin consortium, Sir Richard Branson, consumer organisations and regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its stake in ITV was unwise and disproportionate as a solution – mainly because BSkyB had previously said it was willing to give up its voting rights.
New Investigation into U.S. Attorneys Affair
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to examine the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The move came as a Justice Ministry's chief inspector report on the affair criticized the actions of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was sparked by fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators with the intent to obstruct justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said in a report: "Serious allegations, including potential criminal conduct, have not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice stripped nine U.S. attorneys from their posts in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry said the lawyers had been dismissed due to poor performance.
However, it later emerged that the dismissed lawyers were not rated any worse than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissals were politically motivated.
Some of the attorneys have been involved in prosecuting high-ranking Republican lawmakers and senators, while others have refused to investigate allegations of voter deception against Democrats.
U.S. attorneys investigate and sue in court cases on behalf of the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Ministry, Minister Alberto Gonzales, came under fire over the layoffs and eventually resigned.
A number of other Justice Department officials have also resigned.
The inspector general's report was highly critical of Gonzales' role in the affair, saying he bore "primary responsibility" for the dismissals, that he had "abdicated" from his leadership position and had "not been remarkably involved."
Other officials, including former senior Bush adviser Karl Rove, have been criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's masterpiece will be awarded
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will attend the ceremony in London for his special gold award, said he was "honoured" to receive the recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year's nominations are led by the Coldplay group, which was shortlisted in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that stand above such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed great vocals, which was provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK in 1979 as a single and peaked at number fifteen.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out of Hell stayed on the charts for around nine years and sold more than forty million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery in 2003 for irregular heart rhythm after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Later it turned out that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscure street, often forgotten and maybe soon for sale
New York City has thousands of roads, streets, highways, and other roads, some famous, others merely utilitarian.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and longtime locals have difficulty finding Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of it.
This tiny alley is in the East Village neighborhood and runs north from First Street—without getting to Second Street—between Bowery and Second Avenue.
With a width of about ten and a length of forty meters, it looks more like a dusty passage than a traffic route.
There are no street sign signs.
In an ordinary atlas, it is practically invisible.
Nevertheless, the aisle has admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, the developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants to repave Extra Place and create a cleaner passageway to the shops and boutiques to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbors who say they were enchanted by the shortened alley simply because it was one of the last remnants of the block before the block was refined.
However, the municipal Office for the Protection and Development of Development, which has the street in its power, has no interest in sticking to it.
At a meeting of the municipal council's land committee, representatives of the municipality and Avalon Bay outlined a plan for the developer to buy the street.
But according to Suzan Stetzer, district manager of Municipal Community 3, the committee favors a scenario where the street remains in the hands of the city and has asked for a new plan, which is expected to be submitted next month.
"The city owns very little land anymore, and we would like to see Extra Place remain in its ownership," she said.
"Proposals could be made for repair and management, which is what Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it wanted to repave the small street and install seating, several of which would be used by a café whose interest in leasing the space is expected by the developer.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first made public at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to use the street, it doesn't necessarily want to own it.
"The main intention of Avalon Bay is to repair this desolate alley and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said, adding that the sale was proposed by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Office of Conservation and Development, said the city indeed wanted to sell the street, noting that his office's job was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow mark on history.
Some people think the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large farm was divided among several of his children, and no one laid claim to that narrow strip of land.
The back door of CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, led into Extra Place, and the alley is perhaps best known as the background photo on the cover of the Ramones album Rocket to Russia.
"The place was amazing," says Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and rope."
Some locals, including bloggers who write about the improvement of the East Village, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the piece of public property, however meager, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - an almost unchanged piece of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Lamentations: A bitterly nostalgic view of the city in the process of extinction"), posted part of the Extra Place story from the Talk About the City column that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow cul-de-sac, dark even by day and bordered by rusty iron warehouse doors and knocked-down windows where week-old newspapers run through ditches."
With a few exceptions, the alley one recent evening looked exactly the same.
The rat ran across the blind end of the street near the door that once led to the CBGB, where an expensive clothing store now stands.
There was graffiti on the walls, and next to a fresh batch of discarded newspapers lay an empty beer bottle.
A few passers-by said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that they might find a boost useful.
Fields, on the other hand, said he thinks some people underestimate the impact of the alley in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in places dark, damp, and disgusting."
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in English
In this issue of Education in Focus, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss candidates' attitudes toward bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a California scholar and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of "Worse Than You Think: Why Middle Class Needs to Choose Schools."
Effectively reaching Hispanic voters is a tricky business.
Barack Obama's education agenda proves it.
The Obama campaign notes that "African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," which is true.
To combat such performance gaps, Obama's education agenda is particularly advocating, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for those just learning English.
But the question for Barack Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is stronger than his interest in narrowing performance gaps.
Consider Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in Los Angeles East County.
The students of this school are in the vast majority of cases Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are still learning English.
Despite this, in the state tests in mathematics in 2008, an incredible hundred percent of fourth-graders reached the highest level.
Almost as amazing ninety-three percent of fourth-graders ranked highest on state tests in English language and literature.
This incredible success was achieved by a different method than Obama's preferred method.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of abilities, and an approach without excuses.
Further, and Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, principal of Sixth Street, the school's pedagogical approach is "complete immersion" for those just learning English.
Immersion in English emphasizes the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Miss Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, told me, "We've had tremendous success with one brand new student from Mexico – after twelve months you'd walk into a classroom and not know which one it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for what other schools with large proportions of Hispanic and English-language students should look like?
The school's performance should make the answer to this question a given, but his own party's educational agenda (the National Education Association is a longtime proponent of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education make it obscure the prediction of Obama's answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue when he said people should stop worrying about "English-only" laws.
Instead, "you should ensure that your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to close the performance gap, he should think carefully about educational models that work, rather than ridicule and trivialize them.
Oil Falls Sharply Due to Renewed Economic Fears
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday amid fears that even a U.S. plan to rescue financial markets might not revive the economy.
Oil futures fell as much as 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in morning trading on the New York Commodity Exchange.
Since last Monday, prices have fallen by more than twenty dollars a barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial turmoil on Wall Street as well as a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 a barrel earlier this month, before jumping back on a wave of huge financial market uncertainty.
Anxiety gripped investors again on Monday, even after the Congressional Bureau announced it had reached an agreement over the weekend on the biggest rescue plan in history.
This report has been overshadowed by fresh fears that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the ongoing disintegration, the government announced that Citigroup would buy the banking arm of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the frantic weekend talks that led to the economic rescue plan "are proving incapable of reviving market sentiment."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to fall.
"The outlook for global equities, interest rates and exchange markets has become highly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape contagion.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is to what extent the U.S. virus will spread around the world and China in particular."
The bank's analysts cut their expectations for next year as oil consumption fell due to slower economic growth, and lowered their 2009 gasoline price forecasts by about 20%.
Wild ride in the second quarter broke the team's record
After spending more than anyone else in a Jets jersey over the past eight seasons, defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
Then, on Sunday, he watched the second quarter unfold, in which the Jets turned a pointless game into a graceful drive.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals matched the gloomy clouds above them with their troubled play.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranues Coles on a twelve-yard touchdown sprint, perfectly foreshadowing an afternoon in which their gradually developing relationship moved forward by miles.
Favre sent Coles in that quarter for two more touchdowns, including one in which he dropped a cornerback, and another 10 seconds before the half.
"It wasn't anything out of the ordinary," Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
"He's a damn good player.
We communicated well, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were tossing, the defense was attacking Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis intercepted a stray throw and put it back 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith picked up another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner into a fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, was perhaps the best ever.
The Cardinals got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard goal from the field to give him a 34-0 lead.
That's the most the Jets have ever scored in a single quarter.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, when asked to describe the madness, said, "Second quarter or third quarter?"
When told that both — the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without a response — Mangini said, "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter a lot more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short period of time."
Rested Gebreselassie improves his world record
Ethiopia's Haile Gebreselassie once again showed why many consider him the best long-distance runner ever when he broke his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday to become the first person to run a 26.2-mile race under two hours and four minutes.
By winning on a pleasantly flat track in 2:03:59, he beat by 27 seconds his previous time of 2:04:26, which he ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, who is 35, has set the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly broad - he has broken the world record or at least is the world champion at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic Marathon because he feared - perhaps too alarmed in retrospect - that air pollution would irritate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In near-perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - Gebreselassie won on Sunday with a lightning-fast average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As track runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya focused on longer distances, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decade since Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had calf cramps two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
The break had obviously excited him rather than delayed him.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
A week ago I started again and I was a bit doubtful today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized - particularly in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - for over-planning his races, generally avoiding the world's top marathons, relying on conductors as if it were a race on the track, and putting world records above the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly diminish Gebreselassie's tremendous running qualities.
Kept pace by four Kenyans, Gebreselassie reached the halfway point in 1:02:04.
After they fell off, Gebreselassie was constantly chased by two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
A little earlier than three miles from the finish, Gebreselassie took one last step and escaped Kwambai, who then finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, finished an excellent year with the seventh fastest time in history of 2:19:19.
The record time of 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain.
Thirty-six-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won the London Marathon last spring in a time of 2:24:14.
She skipped the Beijing Games due to what was described as a back injury, but she recovered and won in Berlin, improving her personal best by almost five minutes in the third marathon she has ever run.
She ran the race cleverly and thoughtfully: she let four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners run away to a big lead and then caught them after about 18 1/2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
Pride and obstacles to the life of blacks in a separate city
Tucked away among the sprawling theme parks of greater Orlando, a few miles away from everything shiny, noisy and huge, lies a quiet city in which the pride and demands of African-American life come alive.
Eatonville, the first completely black town to be incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "a city of five lakes, three croquet courts, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools, and no prison."
Now it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to Eatonville's annual Zora! festival to pay tribute to Hurston, Harlem's most famous female writer.
The city she described remains aloof, even though she made it a stopover for tourists by including it in a Florida tourist guide created by the Depression-era Federal Writers project.
It is still as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the thirties, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't even know what he's missing."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open debate about race, many residents remain wary of the views of strangers.
"We pay a lot of attention to how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and toil.
It is both a historical model of black rise and a community of nearly 2400 people, where the poverty rate is double the national average.
It is a center of literature, but also a dub-shaded example of Southern, rural black culture—sometimes despised, sometimes praised—that grew out of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the locals are both proud and protective.
And the concern about the idea of Eatonville really began with Zora, which is the only way Hurston is called here.
She introduced the world to her hometown through heartfelt books full of dialects such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of a Florida tourist guide turned the city just short of Highway 17, which runs through downtown Florida, into a stage of black history and human drama.
With the beat of a big drum in life and literature, Hurston led readers into the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"To the left of the road," she wrote, "is a white brown-decorated modern national school with well-kept yards and playgrounds, always looked after by Howard Miller, though he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned Widow Dasha's new husband, writing that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything that fits into a one-hour hotel."
So, in just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
This was clearly not a typical Fodor's publishing house.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora said it like it was," says ninety-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the choir of Johnson Girls, who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered as a lively eccentric who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin remembers that most of the time, when she rushed into town, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that even today prides itself on dressing with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Franklin said, but many sneered.
"People were always happy to see Zora," Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed very long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were taken out of print.
Eatonville, along with the rest of the world, seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the twenties of the 20th century, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no major mourning ceremonies or large public readings at Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood her importance to the world or her legacy," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's 2003 biography "Wrapped in Rainbows."
The change came in the 80s of the 20th century.
Orange County officials wanted to extend a five-lane highway through the city instead of Kennedy Boulevard, the city's two-lane main road.
Orlando's sprawl has already pushed Interstate Highway 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still emerging from a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the fifties of the 20th century, the struggle for mixing races brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At the time, a bunch of white guys, they came and threw oranges and things at people who were sitting on the side," Franklin said.
"We actually had one lady who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand for forced integration, calling its decision in Brown v. the Education Chamber "offensive rather than glorifying to my race."
Residents now say school desegregation, while positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of local youth.
"Black kids were used to hugs — I remember — you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
This lasted until the teachers and pupils came from the same place, she added.
"You're not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher — I mean, there's a cultural barrier," Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped make room for many other Zora Neala Hurston — black writers, actors, and artists who, like her, rose above prejudice with reckless self-confidence and quotes such as "How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my presence!
I don't get it."
In 1975, Alice Walker arrived at Hurston's unmarked grave and began fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, Robert E. Hemenway's vaunted biography of Hurston hit bookstore shelves and re-placed her in the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as Eatonville's most famous daughter found the ramp lights again.
Hurston's former neighbors now saw her as a savior.
To show what the state can destroy with its highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January many return to celebrate.
After several years, the state withdrew from the highway proposal.
"Those five lanes of highway have resurrected, you would say they blew up, real civic pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd put it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped change the city's image.
Outsiders like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began attending the church in 1993, began to show up in greater numbers, and residents began to reassess the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historic Registry in 1998.
The new one-story library (named, of course, after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the re-asphalted and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the eighties of the 19th century.
(Today, 90 percent black.)
Strangers who come in search of the story and meaning of Eatonville are still often treated with caution.
Permission for most interviews is required in advance, and certain items — such as white-painted murals in Eatonville's oldest church depicting blacks in fields — are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a brave, confident teacher who likes deep reds, still worry that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as Hurston's festival has grown, so has domestic pride.
Young people, especially, tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, troubled and all, but no better, not worse, and as proud, creative, hardworking, foolish, and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
Franklin's nephew, eighteen-year-old Edwin Harvey, voices a genuine love for the community as he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the police, which he says would use some help.
And even younger ones, such as eleven-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they just drive through here, think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to the others,'" Alondra Kenon said recently Sunday after the church.
"But if you really stop and look at the history for a moment, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we are all fluent financially
At first glance, nothing has changed here.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from newsstands and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never have guessed that in the glass beehive of offices overhead, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York have their worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
Messengers still rattle metal carts on the sidewalks and carry muffin roasters to breakfast meetings.
Hispanics still move between tower blocks and wear, like human mules, fifty ironed shirts that hang from the rockers on their backs.
Office rats are still queuing for their morning bagel at street food stalls, and it's still impossible to get a yellow taxi between four and seven in the afternoon on a weekday.
It didn't look like a crisis at all until, with all the talk of pessimism, I decided to open a savings account on Thursday afternoons.
Even though I had timed this task to coincide with the late afternoon siesta at my local JP Morgan Chase office, there were already about twenty people waiting in line.
Not in front of checkout windows to pick up or deposit cash, but in front of the counter where older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to Macy's general store, and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker," came for the same reason I did.
But unlike me, they have already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places where they came, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They took money from so-called thrifts (somewhat similar to building societies), money associations, and those types of savings banks whose branches operate in only one state and which claim to look after their customers like a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have quietly failed.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers returned home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in assets, tried to hunt down a rescue buyer.
The office and shop staff who stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe haven and that does most of the bailouts on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have become fluent in finance over the past week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket was talking on the phone and talking about Lehman Borthers, the failed bank, and its emaciated chief executive, Dick Fulda, with the familiarity of a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed caretaker of my apartment building in her fifties, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation—Brad, Angelina, or my grocery delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, "I now have my savings in money market funds.
I've moved it, I'm not going to take any chances."
Memorable Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's music director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (obituary, September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district music plan, he founded the excellent youth choir Proteus a year later.
He was supposed to be 21, but by the time Proteus sang for the last time in 1979, a few of us were nearly 30 – we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shapeshifter) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to embark on any music presented to it - whether madrigals or Messiaen, either alone or with a full orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often overwhelming, always exciting, and all thanks to the inspiration of this one man and a passion for music that remained absolutely constant throughout.
How often did Tod tell us to "let the music speak for itself."
He said, "A composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
So sing it! "
His baton technique was crystal clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor flowery.
Wherever the musical standard was, it always raised it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor was to be knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in the two decades when he conducted the Guildford Philominsky from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years or so, I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed with any of them - and have been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "dragged one or two soaked songs around the world."
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (September 25) states that "in 1946 he returned to economic history at Oxford, and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... and at the same time studied at BSc, MA and PhD".
This is based on Woodruff's author's note in Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, at which time he completed his dissertation on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, which was subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He actually spent 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at the Universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953, he finally left Nottingham for Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff switched to this part of his career.
Muslim graves desecrated after Austria's right-wing fault
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang party take part in a rally that presented the organization "Cities Against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signs similar to road signs that show mosques crossed out with a red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend in which far-right parties made huge gains in the general election.
More than 90 graves in a cemetery in the town of Traun near Linz were badly damaged sometime between Friday evening and this morning, and police believe it was an organised event.
The culprits spray-painted Jewish symbols such as the Star of David on some graves, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to disguise the extremists' motives of hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was in any way linked to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by reports of desecration as the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan drew to a close.
Austria, meanwhile, is entering a soul-searching round after swinging right in yesterday's parliamentary election.
The two far-right parties, which together won more than 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, have waged vehement anti-immigration campaigns, with some of their slogans denounced as xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the Freedom Party, which won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burqas and even expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived to be related to Islam.
At a recent meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses conducted immediately after the elections, which have positioned the extreme right as the country's strongest political bloc, suggest that this change was mainly due to young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to go on a trip abroad
Gary Glitter, a glam rock star convicted of sexually abusing children, was banned from travelling to France and Spain.
Officials imposed the six-month ban on Glitter after he informed monitoring authorities that he planned to travel via France to Spain.
Kent Police approved the travel ban last Thursday after handing over evidence of Glitter's past child sexual abuse convictions.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Lowest Criminal Court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Courts Service said: "On Thursday 25 September, at Ashford Lowest Criminal Court, Kent Police applied for an injunction that would prevent Mr Paul Gadd from crossing the border into France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not attend in person."
Glitter, 64, informed authorities that he wished to travel abroad, as required by his sex assault record.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They must also hand over the scheduled departure date to the police a week in advance.
If he neglected to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent Police said it would not be hearing individual cases of Glitter's possible trips around the county.
A Kent Police spokeswoman said: "Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to track someone who stays in the UK because we have extensive systems that manage potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting the people of Kent is a top priority for Kent Police and we are working diligently to monitor the behaviour of recorded sexual assaulters to minimise any danger to the public."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok to board a flight to London.
But he said he was not feeling well and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities did not let him pass through passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused to allow him entry, and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On 22 August, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there while his solicitor, David Corker, went to Uxbridge's lowest criminal court in west London and at the same time Scotland Yard successfully requested an order requiring him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter was previously imprisoned for four months in the UK for possession of child pornography.
A Home Office source said Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was calm and glad that Glitter had been prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture the real character, I photograph the master off stage." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no ruffles or costumes.
Only the essence of the great flamenco masters, detached from concentrating on interpretation - this is the only way to achieve a relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other - man.
Inseparable, apart from privacy, in those moments away from the audience - then one can see the intimate gesture, the depth of a fleeting glance, or the passionate gesticulation of hands that are carefree because they are not about to step on stage.
In "Flamenco-people", the German Günther Bauer alternates the theatricality of performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with the lesser-known face of the masters.
With this intention, the photographer compiles a unique iconography of flamenco from different environments.
The exhibition, which runs as part of the Month of Flamenco Photography (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca) program, "reflects the ever-growing international importance of flamenco," says the author, explaining that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people, but if you look at the photographs, you will find that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of bringing passion, sadness, joy to the scene... and completely captivate the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
They carry their personality and character within.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that allows me to capture the personality of flamenco greats.
Fascinated by the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to portray flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble classic photography.
The use of different stylistic means contradicts the classical basis of the film and lends it a contemporary spirit, an idea that, according to Bauer himself, is also reflected in flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, but which does not cease to surprise and evolve."
What captivates the audience is not the effect of the dance, singing or play itself, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we encounter the most essential, that spirit that reveals itself in the way of perceiving, being and experiencing, has been a constant in the work presented during these days in the El Fotómata gallery.
This selection of nearly seventy photographed artists is shaped by well-known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyoso, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo, among others.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenco and will soon be published in a book containing exhibited portraits.
Two years ago, Bauer's passion for portraiture led him to the idea of repeating the idea in "Portraits of Sporty Vintage Cars" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept is different from "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "photographing people, getting to know them and being able to enter their lives for a moment, whether longer or just briefly, is my passion.
I think in photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
A person meets or meets people, personalities that he sometimes does not even know, or they give him only a few minutes to take pictures.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer I always try to realize my ideas."
A collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco entitled "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the El Fotómata Gallery at 20 rue de la Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel he was writing was "audacious."
It takes place in an environment that he does not yet know, and tells about events unknown to him, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully realize his new project - he is currently working on a novel whose main character is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived for twenty years in the Congo and traveled in the Amazon.
The perennial favorite for the Nobel Prize in Literature admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that currently employs him "is presumptuous" and that "everything indicates that I should not write" this novel.
"If I had sense, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I believe that one day I will finish it," he concluded his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words, which over the course of four days saw around a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people in the city of the aqueduct.
The author of the novel "The City and the Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the Feast of the Word and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award for Most Popular Writer — an old edition of Dickens' "Our Mutual Friend" — filled the Juan Bravo Theater to the last place.
With Félix Romeo introducing it, he had before him a resigned audience to whom an hour of time passed like water - the Peruvian recalled with astonishing precision and a good dose of humor how from the original "incredible adventure" of "the pleasure of the passionate reader" and from "the power to live more than I have lived" a literary mission was born in him; how he substitutes for "lack of inspiration" by writing "disciplined", carefully collecting the text, correcting and rewriting; or how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his writing, and what "memory images" are the basis of his stories.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to know if and to what extent books can change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just entertainment, a fleeting experience" - Vargas Llosa emphasized, adding that according to him "they affect people" and "make them try to stand out of line", and urged writers not to "succumb to frivolity" and "take responsibility" of their mission.
Due to climatology, the festival in Pozoblanco is lost - spears are missing
The performance with spears, which closes the ceremony in Pozoblanco, was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement of the performers that the surface of the square was not in good condition.
Therefore, the company, along with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfight.
Unfavorable weather conditions have plagued this celebration for a long time, two of the three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday, rain prevented the second scheduled bullfight.
During them, the formation of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista was to face the bulls in the arena on Castilblanc.
But this was only celebrated on Fridays.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and was rewarded with a dynamic and aesthetically pleasing performance on his shoulders.
That same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante traded two spear blows for salutes and one ear, which brought him more uncovered arena seats than bullfighter art.
Even worse was El Juli, who walked through the Los Llanos bullring in a bland bland.
In the second round of toil without a single respite, he drew sharp criticism from most of the audience.
They escaped the control in Álava in a van with two thousand kilograms of hashish
In ten minutes five.
Road inspection of Ertzaintza in the district of Armiñón (Álava).
The officers stop two people riding in a van and they run away.
The cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is unstoppable.
According to a report by the Basque Government's Department of the Interior, officers chased them and detained one of the people riding in the van, a 38-year-old man identified as A.A.J.
The detainee was charged with drug smuggling and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit were conducting a road check on the N-1 at the point where it passes through the border of the Armiñón district.
They were about to stop the van for checking, but the driver disobeyed the instructions, accelerated sharply and drove away.
The officers immediately began to chase the car until the vehicle stopped at the side of the road a few kilometers away, at which point both passengers jumped out and fled into the woods.
Ertzaintza officers eventually caught up with one of them and confiscated 2,178 kilograms of hashish that the suspects were transporting, as revealed during a search of an Iveco Daily van.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with packages of hashish, which were then taken to other police departments for detailed expertise and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the police found that the license plate was "wrinkled" and did not match the data in the delivery documents, so the detainee was also charged with falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drug.
The detainee, A.A.J., 28 years old, was taken to the police department for appropriate formalities before further investigation could be carried out.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, a favorite of Melrose Place's Amanda, was arrested in Santa Barbara, California, this weekend for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers as she tried to pull out of a parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
The witness stated that around 4:30 p.m. Locklear "stepped on the accelerator violently, swerved back and forth with a loud roar, and tried to get out of the parking space, rubbing her sunglasses several times while reversing."
The witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear pull over on a nearby highway and get out of the vehicle moments later.
The person also alerted the emergency services because she "feared for Locklear's life."
When a police patrol arrived at the scene, they found the actress inside a vehicle that partially blocked the roadway.
She "looked disoriented" and was taken to a specialized drug and alcohol center to undergo a test.
According to a police spokeswoman, the actress cooperated and excessive amounts of alcohol were immediately ruled out, yet "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medication, which was obvious to the officers at first glance."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 7 p.m., although she was released hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic where she was recovering from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian IU association to exercise its powers in the Silva case
IU general leader and United Left MP Gaspar Llamazares said today that a final decision in the case of former Seville City Council's Youth and Sports Councillor, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of acting on behalf of his family, would depend on the party's regional association.
"I am too federalist for that, it is up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares said, hinting at the negotiations the party will have to take in relation to the former Seville city council member.
However, the IU chief insisted that "transparency" was essential in the case of an investigation into Silva's wrongdoing: "IU has always fought to make matters as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public offices."
'May Blood' ('Sangre de mayo'), Garcia's epic bet
José Luis Garci's Sangre de mayo, inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós's Episodes from the National Past, revives the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French – the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around €15 million.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "portray the eloquence of the characters and the analysis of society" that he had always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today together with Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría during the presentation of the film in front of a large team of performers.
May Blood, with over two and a half hours of footage, will be released this Friday, and a more than four-hour series for Telemadrid television is planned in the future.
As a great admirer of the literary work of Galdós, José Luis Garci claims that he fulfilled his "childhood dream" by making this film, thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him to make a film for the bicentenary of the Autonomous Province of Madrid on May 2, and he accepted the offer, saying that the plot would be based on Episodes of the National Past.
The budget of 15 million, to which the province of Madrid contributed in its entirety, represents for Garcia a "unique opportunity" to create an environment with sets and costumes corresponding to the image of "a trembling Spain that was mistaken into a leader to fight for – the struggle for independence led to the decline and backwardness of the country during the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said.
However, the director regrets that he cannot count on the financial support received for Ala Triste or Goya's Ghosts - almost double the size of May Blood - so he could not shoot some scenes from the script signed at the same time by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has worked for almost his entire film career.
The director of "To Start Over" (Volver and the Empezar) works as he is used to - on the set together with the actors with whom he usually rehearses before shooting and whom he does not choose by casting because he finds it "humiliating" and also believes that "part of the director's profession is, among other things, to go to theaters and cinemas and thus learn what is happening in the craft,  which it deals with".
Many of the actors he chose for Blood in May appear in front of his camera several times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga and Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, with four Oscar nominations, one of which he won, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, May Blood alone, Seven Tables of French Billiards and the last selected Blind Sunflowers, represent the younger generation of the Spanish film scene, but claims that "it is yet to be seen."
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
"At first you think you're working for what's next, but then you realize you're only working for money, so you agree to make one more film," explains Garci, who has a more than 30-year directing career.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Seville flamenco dancer will pay tribute to another Seville dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, from a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana, and moved with her family to London when she was three years old.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dances.
She lived a life full of passion, pioneering women's emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf and Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought for the abolition of the corset, which prevented women from moving freely.
Isabele Bayón was enchanted by Isabele Bayón's life influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this character to me – it seemed unbelievable to me."
According to the dancer, "We are not interested in telling her life, but in grasping the soul.
The titles of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So the "butterfly dance" reminded me of the guajira or the "snake dance" of some tango.
Her dancing was sensual and they told me that my dance also corresponds to that aesthetic," she says.
The performance counts on the involvement of two exceptional personalities: Miguel Veda, who will sing to Isabelle in one performance as in "The Open Door" (La puerta abierta), and dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made an exception and agreed to cooperate with her former pupil.
"Matilde represents the elder Tortola, a mature figure.
I am happy that she accepted the offer to participate in my project and it is a great honor for me."
The performance also includes music and guitars by Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, as well as vocals by Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; El Pajar's drums, Raf El Viola's viola and the collaboration of actor Juanfra Juárez, "who has the role of eternal guide of this kind of female artists who are prima donnas with all the trimmings and who are always in love with them".
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, which took place for her time in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, because she usually stayed in London.
"I wanted to mention her because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at a certain time, but nobody knows her today, and even less appreciates her work," Bayón says.
The performance starts today at 8.30pm at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Arts
"I recommend José Vicente Resina's exhibition "Flamenco and Life" because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
They captivated me with the simplicity and strong charge with which they affect the viewers, and the consideration and respect for the photographed.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino can capture magical moments."
The book "Diary of a Newly Married" closes the triennial
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Newly Married" at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), the place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the autonomous Andalusian government to celebrate the "Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of their deaths.
The "Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" is coming to an end with a new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, the renovation of the Nobel Museum House and the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That Ray of the Sun", which opened in May this year, and after touring the various Andalusian provinces, it is planned to move to New York by the time of the congress.
The Cultural Council of the autonomous Andalusian government also ordered eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Newly Married" edited by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Enciso to continue spreading awareness of the personality and work of one of the world's most worldly Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like each other so much anymore
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "No Maliciousness" and, under the weight of knowing that Newman has left, reveals his dismal vision of abandoned American cinema and all of America.
Look how long it took them to get an Oscar.
And that he had been retired since 2007.
And that it was known that he was seriously ill.
Still, he was a guy to everyone.
"Sometimes what a person feels cannot be expressed in any way, and now I have lost a great friend," Robert Redford said in tears, "my life and my country have been better because of him."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
The father of film and country died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, a time when American self-esteem is at rock bottom, when reasons for pride are desperately sought.
When times are rough and people without virtue and only a handful of those worthy of admiration - it doesn't take you to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
To all, he embodied an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a champion of both lost and won cases, from an anti-drug addiction foundation founded in honor of his firstborn son who died of an overdose, to his own brand of homemade food and organic food.
A complete treasure for a country that has taken so much effort to break away from a suicidal eating culture.
A stormy wave of admiration swept Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that it was not one man who died, but an entire era.
Another Englishman, Oscar winner Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was, without exaggeration, the highlight of his career.
The bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
"That fox set a pretty high bar for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who nowadays has the courage to try to live like Paul Newman did – he prides himself on honesty and leads a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy, sometimes not even possible, in today's media jungle.
But fortunately, there are such people, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and since then he has been married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he has been faithful, though he certainly had more than ample opportunity not to be.
"Why would I go out for a burger when I have fillet at home?" he liked to joke.
May he be accompanied in heaven by pride in the fact that there is harmony on earth between his daughters and admirers - this is not very common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles he embodied, he was the most proud of that of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather, and a selfless philanthropist."
The Imperfect Races of Olympic Madrid
Yes, many of us long for the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after a failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I ask: are we ready?
If we follow yesterday's race, I say: no!
It was talked about as a perfect race, and in my opinion it was the worst I've ever been to.
Such a load of nonsense that right away, if it came to evaluation and I was an examiner, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let's look at it from the beginning, one by one.
Nonsense starts with picking up a racing number, for which one has to go early.
That doesn't seem bad to me, but when you go there, they give him everything (including a chip to prevent overcrowding of the track).
But no.
Here one had to first pick up the number (the first nonsense, go there only for that) and (after standing the appropriate queue) - what a surprise! - they only had an S size T-shirt (second nonsense, because I need size XL).
Where do we live?
Did they decide to buy only small T-shirts because of the crisis, because it is less fabric and they are cheaper?
Okay, but that's small things compared to what happened on race day.
In addition to the fact that we had to go very early for the chip and the queue for it lasted over 15 minutes, he also had to hand in his backpack.
The waiting time lasted over 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in a race where 11,000 people are expected.
So, as expected, the race started and we still did not put down our backpacks, and when we did, it was much worse with the pickup.
In addition, the rain prolonged the wait by 40 minutes, which led to a general mutiny and attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow and some, like me, will not see the right time in the evaluation of the results because of the chip they gave me and which, I assume, did not record my start time correctly.
Of course, if someone had asked me about a perfect race, I wouldn't have thought of this one.
And so I think we will have to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a concierge (virtual)
At a conference on new MIT technologies, Microsoft demonstrated further development in a new AI-style image recognition and human interaction system—not very intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks like hailing a taxi (or, in Microsoft's case, a messenger to move around the company's campus) and sensing what they hear in conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can see how many people are in the room, who they are – even remember what they are wearing – and listen to and understand the key words of their conversations.
It can also sort those present by conversation groups.
In the demonstration video, the receptionist records a third person and understands that he does not belong to the group that talks to her, and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if he is going to see anyone and tells her that he will attend to her in a moment.
All this without the blue screen of death.
Breathtaking.
But that, of course, is the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about Microsoft's strategy change.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won't have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer figured out that if computers had only the bare necessities, without the burden of commercial uselessness, they would be five times more powerful – man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
A discovery like thunder, considering that Microsoft adds new features and other "extras" to Windows version by version.
A change of direction would be a meritorious act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its relevance and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the net, I became one of those who lean towards the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
An operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential layer to understand between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms that idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more to the Internet browser.
The computer turns on to start Firefox or Explorer — or Chrome — and we spend more time on the Internet every day than around windows.
What are the use of half of the applications that accompany the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here is a small example.
I took this photo at a rest room for Microsoft employees in Redmond earlier this month.
There was a poster on the vending machine asking them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, by the way, the delay of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's count on 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for delays.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio shone in Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond," as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather," and it's part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to go into the list of his life roles, we can dive into the image of a typical muscleman with a pointed mustache who lifts weights in a traveling circus.
Basically, it is nothing more than a typical cotton men's undershirt, tight and sleeveless.
English speakers call it a 'tank', but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels stands out above all others.
Firstly, because of its breakneck name - although it is popularly called 'Marcel' - which is related to sport, because, as legend goes, it was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above the rest with its quality cotton, unisex cut, distinctive nameplate and (almost imperceptible) Belgian flag, which the models of the most emblematic tank tops have as a detail at the neck.
And beware, because the Belgian company does not specialize only in tank tops.
It also produces college sweatshirts, retro boxer shorts, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy T-shirts, children's outfits, mini shorts...
Thoughtful pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it is a pity that they are just underwear.
They are too beautiful.
Honda will attack for the second time with its bestseller
In November, Honda will launch the second-generation Jazz.
If the predecessor of this single-box vehicle already had a lot of space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
Added to this are improved engines that increase driving comfort and allow greater fuel economy.
Evolution rather than revolution.
This is the second generation Honda Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes to this single-box car.
Examples include innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Even before we examine the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes to the market six years after the launch of the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we notice is that Honda needed a shorter period than other manufacturers to rejuvenate this model.
Although the Jazz is a lesser-known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, the country where the Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
It is in Japan that almost a million units have been sold since the launch of the Honda Jazz.
The second market was the old continent with approximately half a million units sold in six years.
Honda, however, aims for the new Jazz to increase sales in its category.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of the Honda Jazz, in 2009 estimates put the number of 100,000 cars in the European market, which would represent an increase of 17% in the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of the Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects sales of 2,000 units for the full year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
The carmaker's management thus de facto expects to end the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which means 4,000 fewer than in 2007 and a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market to 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
In 2010, the Japanese firm expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda is counting on the success of its next new model.
It is the Honda Insight, a five-door hybrid of a compact size with a length of 4.37 meters, from which the Japanese company expects worldwide sales of approximately 200,000 units per year.
In terms of markets, according to estimates by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be split between the old continent and Japan.
The Honda Insight is expected to go on sale in the first months of next year, when it is presented to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, all dimensions of the new Jazz have increased.
Its length has increased up to 3.9 meters (five centimeters more), width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and wheelbase to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, has not changed and is still 1.52 meters.
By increasing the dimensions, the interior space was also enlarged.
This advantage was achieved both by using a new platform and by storing the fuel tank in the middle of the car, which had already been used in the previous Honda Jazz.
The luggage compartment volume - which has a double bottom system - has also increased to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the luggage compartment volume of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in the version with the 1.4 engine, since the luggage compartment volume of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
In addition to exterior features such as LED rear lights and the possibility of fitting a panoramic glass roof, another improvement is easier access to the rear seats.
Doors leading to the second row of seats allow an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 for the first Jazz.
The engines are also new to the second-generation Honda Jazz.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two 1.2 and 1.4-liter petrol engines.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which enables lower fuel consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and delivers excellent powertrain upgrades along with high torque over the full engine speed range.
The first 1.2-liter engine has a power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had 78 hp in the previous generation Jazz - has a consumption of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, the current one will reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 hp has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
"I want to be a young mother. Who will be a father does not worry me."
The overwhelming resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz, though small in stature, is a woman full of life.
The Cruz sisters are now taking their new fashion venture very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than just some pretty, famous girls lending their names.
In Paris, she took part in a promotional event organized by Mango at its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most important fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
She is both cordial and shy and will win you over up close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango for this autumn-winter season, and at the same time I attended the announcement of the second annual "Mango Fashion Awards" and a dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
So it was a challenging but exciting day at the same time.
What is your new collection for Mango, for which you have been working for the fourth season, based on?
My sister and I love films from the '50s and '60s, and we drew a lot of input from them.
I also love to wander around the city and watch women dress up, how they combine and layer their clothes, I do this very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, but in the end everything is interconnected and has many connections.
For example, I liked clothes from a young age, I always wanted to go to my grandmother's house, rummage through my aunt's closet and look at her clothes.
That was a sensation, almost better than going on a pilgrimage.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to how I dressed.
You know that we dancers take pride in how well-groomed we are to feel good in our lessons and rehearsals when looking in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, that's when you really get into the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You recently turned 30, have you had a crisis?
Whereabouts.
I feel better than ever, I enjoy thirty.
I find that the woman is already done, has experience and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
Since childhood I do what I want to do, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body demands it, and besides, I want to be a young mom, I don't want to miss out.
As for my father, I don't worry about that.
But I know one thing for sure, I will give my child a feeling of happiness and I will raise him with great love.
As for the film, you are now waiting for several premieres of the films you made last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to them coming to cinemas.
I come from the world of theatre, so I am very impatient and restless, I want everything right now and of course it is not possible.
I am looking forward to the premiere of "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
On purpose, as you will like...
A few days ago you had your premiere on the catwalk alongside Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I went to stand on the catwalk as a model.
I just got a call from Naomi Campbell, whom I've known for a long time, inviting me to London to attend a benefit show for her organisation 'Women for a Better Life', and the clothes we were showing - I also chose two models from our Mango collection - were auctioned off and the proceeds were given to Naomi's NGO.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
A lot of things are said about her, and I, knowing her, can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'll stick to the good things he's involved in.
She asked me to perform for charity, but if she asks me to do a handstand, I'll do it too.
I will do whatever it takes for the benefit of Third World women.
"Auto bee" prevents collisions
This time, Nissan has taken inspiration from nature, specifically bees, to advance the development of accident protection technologies.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes as a model the flying of bees and thus prevents collisions.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C, which represents the first step in collision avoidance technologies.
Engineers at the Nissan Motor Co. Center for Technical Advancement developed the robot in collaboration with the Center for Advancement in Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, general manager of public relations for technology, research and development for the brand, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan's four safety shield zones.
The robot is tasked with strengthening the collision avoidance capability of cars of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which closely resembles a Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the compound bee eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, which allows the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
Engineers designed what they called a Laser Range Finder to create this visual feature.
It records obstacles up to two meters away from a radius of 180 degrees in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts it into a collision warning.
"The moment an obstacle is detected, the robot mimics the bee's movements and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to a right or even greater angle to avoid a collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is that all evasive maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobile Lab and Chief Engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, a robot cannot move up and down or diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and the direction in which it is enabled by the rotation of its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities as in bees.
In addition to accelerating and decelerating, Nissan used the rotation function to prevent the robot from colliding.
"The device only needs to process information every few seconds and act on that data.
It does not require the retention of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, thanks to which it can operate without interruption with only two dozen kB of memory.
It may surprise you, but we're not talking about giga or mega."
This is the first step in the development of new immediate collision avoidance technologies, a technology that Nissan predicts will be used in production cars in a decade.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be to incorporate a unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to their destination while avoiding obstacles on the way.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will need to install an "alcolock"
The Home Office requires a driver with three administrative penalties for drink-driving to install a system in his car to prevent him from starting the car while drunk or if he is out of breath.
The proposal became known in June this year and is now included in the annual report of the Prosecutor General's Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for one year.
Its aim is to get the driver back behind the wheel, so drivers will also have to undergo a course of traffic re-education.
In addition to the National Traffic Safety Authority, the General Directorate of Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Technology for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will also participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of motorists charged more than once for drunk driving get behind the wheel again.
Alcolock should prevent this, as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver has not breathed before or if a higher than permitted alcohol concentration is recorded.
Its price exceeds €1 000 and would have to be paid by the culprit himself.
A study to this effect carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that offences on vehicles equipped with this device decreased by 65% during the first year after their introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address such conduct before it results in a criminal offence.
And to help introduce it, since legislation can be done in the usual way, the necessary modification of the criminal provisions requires a change in the law.
The device is not yet available in any retail version on the Spanish market, although it has already been installed on a trial basis in some industrial and utility vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on a proposal by the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) recommending the installation of this system in school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British precision, at 5:40 p.m., as stated in the program, a Spanish Air Force plane carrying the Prince and Princess of Asturias landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico D.F.
The sun was just setting, but its rays still forced one to cover one's eyes with one's hand to see the successor couple disembarking from the plane.
At the foot of the steps stood the Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish prince and princess were coming for a state visit.
- yes, that's great, you won't be able to get to the airport to pick up people at that time... She's from here or something...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- yes, that's right...
But the Mexican press knows who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and how significant their visit is.
Many people wait in the hangar at the airport just outside the red carpet and military cordon, which consists of 27 naval soldiers ready to fire a volley of honor.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a dark blue suit, and the princess, dressed very sparingly and with flowing hair, does not have her usual "peeptoes", apparently she has been informed that a thunderstorm is imminent in D.F.
Before they enter the hall where the official delegation is waiting, they smile at the photographers and pose for them casually.
At the door of the hotel where they will be staying, one of the four largest in the city, a talkative Mexican TV reporter is waiting for them.
Enjoy the fear before you take out a mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the US Treasury, in addition to having enough capital to hand out injections, does not lack ingenuity.
Faced with a crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking out subprime mortgages with banks with dubious solvency, it created a popular science game "Bad Credit Hotel" on the Internet.
Or "Hotel of Bad Loans"... or a confused hotel.
The hotel, and especially its receptionists, look gloomy, making you think once, twice or three times about whether it's the right time to apply for credit.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably its intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, albeit not very detailed.
It is a site suitable for young people rather than a space for the whole public.
And what happens when the game ends?
Inside the hotel appears a dream room.
At least something, because you better not talk about buying a house...
Top Subsidized Fashion Award
There is probably no more suitable place in the world for the announcement of a fashion prize than Paris, and there is probably no more excellent designer and bon vivant than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to enable international presentation of new talents in the fashion sector.
The prize is endowed with 300,000 euros.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, winner of the first edition, looked at her designs yesterday in the Manga window at 54 Haussmann Boulevard in Paris and almost wept with emotion.
Sure, it's the company's second-largest store in Europe and has just opened on 1,335 square meters.
The largest one is located in London.
Many events, together with the desire to thank the designer Valentino for taking on the chairmanship of the competition jury, caused us to end up having a sumptuous dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
Mango's festively decorated chairman's table looked a little more stunning, next to Chagall's finest works.
Nati, who showed no signs of showing anything with heartbreak at the recent death of her brother, donned a breathtaking ELAH dress and breathtaking ELAH jewellery and, hung up on her son Luis – a nearly two-metre-tall chick – accompanied Valentino at the head of the table at dinner in his honour.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, took the welcome and, like a true gentleman, was left without a jacket with Baron Rothschild, as they had both offered them to two ladies.
Mónica Cruz, who arrived at the store in her self-designed trousers and shirt and changed into a long sexy black dress for dinner, was moved by a night walk around the Opera accompanied by Goya Toledo, showed us the hall for ballet rehearsals and, remembering other times, grabbed one of the poles and indicated a "grand plié".
Inés Sastre did not stay to tour the adjacent buildings of the palace, but before leaving, she showed us photos of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the presence of Oliviero Martínez - another young man who rides a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own sheets and towels and asked in advance that no fragrances be used in his rooms.
Stars under the starry Parisian sky.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget about chaotic and frantic everyday life.
To make matters worse, they are all summarized in one book, which will bring relaxation to the bookstore on September 30.
The alarm clock rings every morning at 7 o'clock as a punishment, but it is even worse to imagine yourself absorbed in the rushed rhythm of contemporary life.
The office is called voltage and the computer is called back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
However, there are neither one nor two methods of combating everyday exhaustion and the difficulty of detaching oneself from the world of work.
No, that number is no bigger, and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga postures, classical massages and "spa" therapies, Susannah Marriott has collected a whole "menu" of options in the pages of her book, adapted to the tastes and time possibilities of each individual.
The anti-stress book is called "1001 Way to Relax" and thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK, it will bring peace to the bookstore.
If one thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace in such areas as work or personal relationships, the "manual" denies this view.
In addition, it offers other ways to be in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline is no longer circulating in your veins to restore balance in your body, and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, switch off, and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some children talk at night.
I don't mean the ones who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they sleep.
When it happens for the first time, it may startle you, but in reality it is meaningless.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somnilokvia.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely more than one of you has been told that he spoke in his sleep at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example, once in a lifetime with high fevers), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once every few months...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single reason to explain its onset.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night demons, enuresis nocturne or sleepwalking, but this does not have to be the case.
As mentioned earlier, it can often accompany very high fevers, stressful or agitated situations.
In any case, this is a little-understood phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or vice versa (screams, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where it manifests itself with great force, it would be advisable to observe the child and consult a specialist to see if he has any problem that causes great anxiety in him and manifests itself in this way.
We have said that it is a harmless disorder, so it is not treated unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, what we can do is keep in mind some very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to upset the baby too much before going to bed.
So look for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV programs or series.
For very nervous children and those who find it difficult to relax, it is possible to use relaxation techniques that will help them gain some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
When somniloknie appears, try to keep calm.
Remind yourself that she is harmless to the child and that he will not remember anything of what happened the next day.
Useful advice
Don't be him.
It's useless because he's not conscious and you'll interrupt his sleep.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps and therefore rests.
Remember that if you feel distressed several times in a row, it would be a good idea to seek advice or find out what causes such anxiety in your child.
If he understands what he is saying (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to interrogate him and extract information from him.
It will be of no use, because when he sleeps, he is not conscious to organize his thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming about, and therefore why he is saying it, so be very careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you reach.
Never tell your child that you can ask him about his secrets at night.
Not even for fun.
This causes great anxiety.
Just don't worry, it's not a bad thing, it's just an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way back to victory after a long lean period.
Without playing a particularly big game, the Yellow and Black created more chances and managed to convert one of them victoriously.
The pace of the game was not very fast during this encounter, in which the attackers had a hard time asserting themselves.
After the first attempt by the host captain Kauffmann, who narrowly missed the line with a long-range shot, Illhaeusern began to have a slight upper hand and first Fonderflick from distance, then Hirne through the air, Romain on a long leg or Diebold gradually came to irritate Dannemarie's defence.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive wall in the middle of the pitch and left only the agile Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half proved decisive, first thanks to two chances from Dannemarie with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the scoring for Illhaeusern, which was taken care of by Marais, well positioned to handle the ball bounced after Diebold's previous attempt (53').
However, the Illhaeusern goalkeeper did not enjoy the joy for long, after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room, leaving his teammates weakened.
Dannemarie, however, was unable to capitalise and the eleven from Illhaeusern, who withdrew just a little to "thicken" the defence, did not cause any major trouble, except in the very last seconds of the match, when the ball flew very close to the crossbar after much confusion.
Sarkozy goes to meet angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy takes a detour through Brittany.
To counter the demonstration of power by fishermen who severely disrupted the accessibility of several Breton and Normandy ports on Monday, the French president decided to head to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The latter have promised that it will be adopted "in a constructive spirit" and hope to "come up with concrete proposals".
The president's visit coincides with the general assembly of a "crisis committee" set up by Breton fishermen to take action against the sharp rise in diesel prices, which has peaked at more than €1.14 per litre on average.
According to Élysée Palace spokesman David Martinon, the president "will talk to them about solutions that can be envisaged to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure the conditions of employment and payment of seafarers."
Nicolas Sarkozy is greeted with firmness by fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out Operation Snail (slow-moving vehicle operations) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10km of traffic jams.
The Quiberon holiday port was also blocked, but services to Belle-île were not interrupted.
A filtration dam was put into operation on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors showed their resolve on Monday when they burned tires and pallets at dawn outside the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as the Sables d'Olonne in the Vendée, where trawlers remained in the port, or Le Havre, where about twenty vessels blocked the traffic of merchant ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges during the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting at the ministry before deciding to act.
In Guilvinec, a "crisis committee" is to decide on Tuesday how to continue on this path and on its participation in the upcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the state fisheries department, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishermen will not abandon anything" and "do not want to come to Paris", said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient fisheries union.
Professional fishermen who do not pay diesel tax currently pay around 50 cents per litre, but consider that the profitability threshold is only reached when the oil is below €0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" has died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes paid tribute to film legend and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who has died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its 2008 delivery projections
The Brazilian planemaker is counting on the delivery of 215 planes this year, despite the threat of recession looming over the world economy.
The world's fourth aircraft designer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 units delivered, confirmed its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially considering the range of its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese clients over a period of eight years.
AIG is reportedly considering divesting 15% of its assets
American International Group, an insurer that has been put afloat by U.S. financial authorities, is considering ceding more than 15 percent of its assets in order to repay $85 billion given to it as a down payment, reports Sunday's Financial Times.
AIG is set to examine the sale of most of its non-life insurance business internationally and retirement activities in the United States, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
According to the FT, AIG's board of directors met on Sunday evening to examine a possible transfer.
No confirmation statement could be obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG intends to divest include its airline leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in insurance provider Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its property portfolio and private equity investments, the FT adds.
No final decision has yet been taken on these disposals, France Télécom continues.
AIG must urgently raise cash to repay the $85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve Bank, risking 80% of its capital being seized by US authorities, thereby diluting its current shareholders to the appropriate proportions.
Paris. Analysis of the historic Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic drop on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's bank bailout plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 777.68 points to 10,365.45.
The largest point drop in its history (684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, the day trading resumed after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The technology-dominated Nasdaq lost 199.61 points to 1,983.73, according to the final data after the close of trading, and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
Embarrassed from the start of the session, Wall Street literally plummeted after the House of Representatives' unexpected rejection of a bank bailout plan, a plan that was supposed to allow markets to regain some stability.
By 228 votes against and 205 in favour, they refused to provide Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson with the funds he had requested.
Nearly two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market that Congress is unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added, expressing concern that the project, adopted in a few days, would come "too late".
"If this project is indeed doomed (...), the baton will be passed immediately to the Fed and other central banks to stave off a crisis, which would further strengthen credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And emphasizing the urgency of the situation, Piegza noted that in the United States, "every new day brings the downfall of a financial institution."
After the collapse of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking operations by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly gained momentum, requiring urgent interventions on behalf of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are facing "not just an American crisis, but a global crisis," the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market rose sharply.
Treasury yield for 10 years fell to 3.632% from 3.827% on Friday evening, and yield for 30 years to 4.161% from 4.357% the previous day.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's largest bank, is entering its midst, spending nine billion dollars to raise 21% of its capital. The adoption of this news was accompanied by a significant drop in its exchange rate.
A week after revealing their preliminary agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG intends to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's common stock at a single price of $25.25, totaling $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as of August 31.
MUFG is investing another six billion dollars to acquire convertible securities that provide a 10% yield and have an exchange price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the entire operation would take place on the basis of an average uniform price of $29, or 28% below its current rate.
Still, Morgan Stanley lost 6.79%, hitting $23.07 around 5 p.m. GMT.
"This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status," said John Mack, CEO of the U.S. Group.
Morgan Stanley's new statute was adopted last week, allowing it to diversify its activities, but placing it under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Its merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street's biggest aces to take a much more cautious approach than before.
The terms unveiled on Monday show, among other things, that the deal has been altered over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago," Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG's CEO, explained in Tokyo, "we thought our participation would consist entirely of common stocks.
However, given the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to keep risks to a minimum and also to cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay 7% less than their book value for Morgan Stanley securities.
And the operation will result in a decrease in earnings per share by about 20%.
The agreement envisages that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into common shares in a year's time if MUFG converts for a certain period of time at a price 50% above the exchange price, i.e. around $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital brought in by MUFG will allow it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its cash.
A spokeswoman for the group declined to provide details on the two new allies' strategic projects.
Following MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to boast a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had "noticeably" reduced his balance since the end of August.
Recent weeks have been challenging for the group, as its stock market price has fallen by half, while insurance costs against the risk of non-payment associated with debt have soared.
These costs reversed on Monday but remained high at around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's big investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the Merrill Lynch buyout, announced that it had raised $15 billion, in part from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
Re-establish a republic around socialism of the XXI century.
Such is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
Last Sunday, the third-named put a draft of a new Constitution to the vote, following the example of his counterparts and friends.
And his mission is accomplished, because 64% of the electorate, according to official results covering 80% of the vote, voted "yes" in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% of the votes were "No", 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were blank.
To be adopted, the draft Constitution had to obtain half the votes plus one.
Two exit polls and a calculation by an NGO predicted a resounding "yes" victory on Sunday, placing them between 63% and 70%.
Indeed, Rafael Correa demanded victory for his draft Constitution on the night of Sunday to Monday.
"The constitution has won the day," he assured, congratulating Ecuadorians at the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which according to the Organization of States of America (OEA) observation mission took place peacefully, concerned a text of 444 points building the "new socialism" promoted by the president.
The draft Constitution sanctifies the power of the state over the economy by reserving to it the "development planning" of a country living mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and from the foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
The proposal sponsored by Correa, who was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of state, who will be able to serve two consecutive four-year mandates and will be able to dissolve the chamber.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power to run for a new mandate in February 2009.
Among other things, the constitution reinforces the principle of free health and education, which the president began to implement in a country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it envisages a ban on the presence of foreign troops, thus ending the agreement between Washington and Quito on the use of the Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US counter-narcotics operations.
Obama wins on points in first televised duel
Friday's first debate between the two candidates at the White House was followed by a second debate to determine which of the two John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The campaign command boots of Republicans and Democrats were not surprised when both declared their victory in a televised duel watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, while decent, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to halt the decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential election.
Gallup, whose poll released Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49 percent to 44 percent for McCain), thinks the Democrat is the one who won the duel.
Among the undecided voters who matter right now, Obama is the winner for 39 percent of those polled, while, according to a CBS poll, 25 percent attribute the victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with a presumed good performance from his running mate Joseph Biden, during his first and only public debate with his opponent, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She's gifted," Bill Clinton said over the weekend.
McCain, a septuagenarian, consistently emphasized his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, while emphasizing his opponent's "naivety" on the issues that were at the heart of the first confrontation.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." There were repeated accusations.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to become president," he said.
Republican TV spots have been in such an offensive spirit since yesterday.
Obama, by contrast, emphasized that he represents the future.
He did not lose his head and proved to be concise and precise.
He emphasized his ability to make the right decisions and restore the United States' reputation in the world.
"McCain still hasn't understood, whereas Obama has," said a Democratic ad over the weekend, accusing the Republican of not taking enough into account the impact of the crisis on the "average American."
"During the ninety-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama told 20,000 people gathered for a campaign rally in North Carolina in heavy rain.
Nor did he utter words like "middle class" or "workers." Financial disintegration clearly favors Obama, whom Americans see as better suited to rescuing an economy on the brink.
"There could be a decisive turning point next week," influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer predicted yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "economic acumen" to that of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic nominee, the current disaster is "the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policies as pursued by George Bush and as supported by Senator McCain."
The senator from Illinois reaffirmed that despite Wall Street's unexpected leaps, he should be able to cut taxes for 95% of Americans, and also pointed out that realizing the country's eventual energy independence by promoting renewable energy sources is his number one priority, along with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates carefully dodged questions about the $700 billion (€470 billion) financial assistance plan adopted by Congress last night and which is deeply unpopular.
"What about you, have you noticed that there were any elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated in the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday evening to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening, immediately after polling stations closed in Minsk's main square, to protest against the irregularities of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results have yet been announced, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: 'dictator, resign'.
Some admit that they didn't even vote: "What good would it be if they do whatever they want with my vote anyway," says one young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is prepared to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, which include a visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and a freeze on some assets, could be lifted if the election is deemed clean by observers.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
"We were kept away from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting of votes," complained Yuri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leading figure in the pro-European movement, "because what matters is who counts the votes, and in our country it is the executive power.
If any opposition MPs get into parliament, it will be because they are appointed and not elected.
However, their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and bills."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in political functioning, because "it is necessary to start a dialogue with the European Union.
If our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is hit by a crisis and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which was monitoring the elections, will declare the elections valid.
It points out that turnout seems too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way to all possible manipulations.
"What about you, have you noticed that there have been any elections?" asked social democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August.
"There was not a foot in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, the ones who most suit the regime."
The silence of the night took over the October Square again.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate each other on their success.
19 hostages freed in Chad
An Egyptian commando attacked the kidnappers of eleven tourists and their eight-member entourage, who had been captured ten days earlier.
They are in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who had been held captive in the desert for ten days, were taken alive and well to the Egyptian capital on Monday.
During the morning, they were liberated by Egyptian commandos in Chad.
The hostages arrived around 3:30 p.m., apparently in good shape, aboard a special plane to the al-Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without having the opportunity to comment in the press, aboard helicopters to a hospital in Maadi, a peripheral residential area of Cairo, to undergo medical examinations.
"They are completely healthy" and "no ransom has been paid to the hijackers," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garrana said on the airport's taxiway.
Since their capture on September 19, during a four-wheel drive safari at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages has been dragged from one hideout to another by 35 unknown hijackers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard and the director of the Aegyptous agency, the organizer of the safari.
A senior Egyptian security official indicated that 30 special forces who had approached the site aboard two helicopters had set off during the night just before dawn.
"There was a shootout, half of the hijackers were killed and the rest fled," said the source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commandos.
From Belgrade, where he is currently located, the head of Italian diplomacy, Franco Frattini, mentioned the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We have to admit that we achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of people from our secret services, from the special forces," he said, without elaborating.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve, the Sudanese military said it had seized a four-wheel drive vehicle carrying hijackers during a patrol, killing six, including a Chadian commander, and arresting two.
The military claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement - Unity (SLA-U), which the movement immediately rejected.
Letters - The silent majority of the Ministry of Culture
The debate on the financing of culture fills the pages of newspapers with headlines and is the topic of the current election campaign.
Better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise up to denounce the paltry sums that are given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, and national sites of interest that are starving?
What politician dares to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and its historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have laws that actually protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is donating three and a half million euros to restore just Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
For our American neighbors, the Constitution states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage should be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives, and all county organizations, in concert.
In Quebec, the Federation of Societies for the History of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers associated in 211 societies for history, monuments, archives and genealogy are working to uncover history, preserve a pile of private archives and protect archaeological remains for a few pennies.
Often, these companies are the watchdogs of our monuments, driven by despair to protest as promoters and executives unleash their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will we finally see a tribune for history and monuments?
Interview - Blood that is certain again
Héma-Québec celebrated its tenth anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly happy because Héma-Québec had become one of the most reliable and efficient blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he regained the trust of the public, which was seriously shaken after the contaminated blood scandal in the 80s and 90s.
As is widely known, the state blood reserve managed by the Transfusion Department of the Canadian Red Cross was contaminated with the immune deficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus during the 80s.
In view of this drama and a wave of public outrage, the Canadian government opened a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations that such a disaster should not happen again.
While Judge Krever hesitated to submit the report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this role was played by the Gélineau Committee.
After the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were established in Canada: Heme-Québec, which was to farm Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Company to supply all the provinces and both territories.
"When Héma-Québec started its activities in 1998, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system," Dr. Décary recalls.
"The situation was disheartening.
Through continuous efforts to improve the safety of blood products and continuous work in this area over the following years, we have regained the public's trust," he says, proudly adding that by the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of Quebec's population trusted Hema-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is something very fragile."
Since its founding on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
"At that time, we saw the emergence of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease," says the woman who has led the company since its founding in 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could spread through the blood.
We have therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which, where we do not know and where the spread of a serious disease, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterised by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, is at stake.
In April 1999, therefore, we refused blood from people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
So this episode showed us that sticking to the precautionary principle made sense."
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid (NAT) tests, which make it possible to detect the presence of the virus itself in donor blood, rather than the antibodies on which the tests used previously were based.
NAT tests have made it possible to shorten the deaf period between when a patient is infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood with our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to shorten this period to less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors could be infected without them knowing it and without being able to find out.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of acquiring AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of getting HIV-contaminated blood.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will need to be distributed before someone becomes infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products annually, it will take 24 years for the first case of HIV transmission through the blood product to appear.
I believe that today we can get or prescribe a blood transfusion necessary for recovery," says the head of the management of Héma-Québek.
"The challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what disease-causing element may appear in the system.
Just last year, the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the blood by insect bites.
We need to be cautious at all times," Dr. S. Smith continues. Décary emphasizes that in addition to secure supplies, Héma-Québec must also count on sufficient supplies.
"Needs are growing as the population ages.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
Population ageing also has implications for the blood donor network, which on average consists of only 3% of Quebecers eligible for donation."
However, any healthy person at least 18 years old, meeting the criteria of admissibility, can donate blood only once every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people offering blood are not accepted because they are carriers of AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have visited a country where mud fever is raging, they are excluded for a year.
"With this 3%, we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of hospitals.
Deficiencies are very rare.
However, members of the donor network need to be supplemented as they age and can no longer donate blood.
But convincing people to donate blood is difficult, especially to retain them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life today is so unbridled that we rarely find an hour to donate blood," laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin that is almost exclusively used for major burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Heme-Quebec, which also manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, which was previously considered biomedical waste, is rich in stem cells, which can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample into the bank, and we expect to collect over a thousand a year.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplants," says Dr. Décaryová, who describes the umbilical cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Some moms are disappointed that they can't access it," because Héma-Québec doesn't have enough resources to offer this complex and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in the semifinals
Impact Montreal qualified for the semifinal round of the USL Division I playoff series at Saputo Stadium yesterday in the second and decisive quarterfinal game of the Total Goals, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4-3 is a goal tally after both games) over the Seattle Sounders.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a goalless first half on both sides, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the remaining two goals of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could handle Matt Jordan in favor of the Sounders.
Recall that on Friday, during the first of two quarterfinal matches, Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a Seattle suburb.
Impact will face the Whitecaps of Vancouver in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnnesota, the Thunder evened up a 3-1 deficit at home and eventually won 4-3, but the Whitecaps still advanced to the semifinal round with a 5-4 aggregate goals.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series of games won't be confirmed until today.
Briefly - Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadien's first offensive trio is set to start the season.
A unit of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekance and Andrei Kosticin last night at Centre Bell galvanized the attack to a 3-2 shootout victory for Canadien.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec collected two assists and Kovalev collected one pass in this fourth three-color victory from six preseason games.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring a single goal in separate shootouts.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian said.
"I need one more game to feel good."
"He tried to do too much in the first period," Guy Carbonneau said.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice round of applause."
Charest bets on the north
The prime minister does not rule out calling early elections by the end of the year
Immediately after the Liberal Party congress (Parti libéral), Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is running in today's by-election.
"Pushing back the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually engaging way at the conclusion of the Quebec Liberal Party Congress in Lévis, without giving details.
During his speech, pictures were projected behind him in a kind of picture mill.
On three huge screens ran a loop with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, mines, Quebec from the perspective of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Generous resources, similar to the pre-election period.
At the press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out calling early elections in the autumn, although he pointed out that he has a very busy schedule.
"Plan North" forms the fourth dimension of the "vision" the prime minister intends for Quebec, a vision of a "new economic space" that includes a labor agreement with France, a deal between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the Northern Territory on the 49th parallel - has recently been often mentioned by the Prime Minister in his statements, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the prime minister limited himself to explaining why the North represents a "jewel with huge potential", but did not give a deadline, the amount of investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
At most, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further elaborated: in particular, hydroelectric power, forests, but above all the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
The north, according to Charest's account, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds."
This "territory twice the size of France is with us," "is in Quebec.
And it's not just with us, it's in us," he stressed, as if to show that he was invoking a national founding myth.
Quebec was built largely in relation to the North, the prime minister pointed out: the pursuit of gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, pausing theatrically to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes the part of Labrador that Quebec has always wanted, the prime minister said during a press conference.
"This is a traditional position that has been repeated by all previous governments.
There is one boundary line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and if the opportunity arises, I will retake that position in the name of the government," he suggested.
Otherwise, "we also need to rethink our vision of the North in the context of climate change," he said, referring to the North-West transition that will open year-round as glaciers melt.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that seizing territory becomes an obligation.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, indigenous peoples and Inuit?
The prime minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially the young.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (a former pequist MP from Ungava), have already started negotiations with some thirty communities.
An interministerial committee, chaired by Benoît Pelletier and with an important position in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be set out".
After all, the North's development should be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
Plan North will be "jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a seamless continuation of that of the Liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our mindsets to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
That was one of the much-discussed topics of the weekend, which opened on Friday with a big cocktail celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's ascension to the party's leadership.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to rechristen the Beauharnois headquarters the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who carried out the Peaceful Revolution and nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who created James Bay, our party has been able to shape the future," said Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he appealed to another authority, this time conservative, namely John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
When it came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam, Charest pointed out that its launch is planned for 2012.
"I'm only saying it between us, but I plan to be there," he confided to his membership, eliciting considerable applause.
The same prime minister who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and undoubtedly not even in 2009, has not ruled out the possibility of calling elections in the autumn of this year, which is allowed by law.
However, he stressed that his schedule is packed, especially the Federal Council's mission to China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend congress provided the Liberal leader with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, especially certain "efforts to amend the constitution," which passed very smoothly: the PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebec) demanded in particular recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wants Quebec to appoint a portion of the members of Canada's Broadcasting Council who would have veto power over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, Plan North was received with scepticism in its main features.
PQ (Parti Québecois) leader Pauline Marois has re-launched the Northern Development Policy of Quebec, launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it renounced this policy.
If she had stuck to it, "we would be further away today," Marois remarked alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where elections are held today), Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the government's adoption of Plan North.
"But we want it to be more than just theatre," explained Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Mario Dumont, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - Disgraced country
It was Vic Toews, the former Minister of "Justice" (oh irony) in Harper's cabinet, who dared to call Louise Arbour a "disgrace" to Canada last summer.
To humiliate a woman who has waged a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about the Prime Minister's entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government which, as the only one of all the Western countries involved, has not repatriated a national locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a young adolescent at the time of the alleged acts to take place.
The only government that, despite Canada being a signatory to the Geneva Convention, denies its word and leaves a child soldier to rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one that relies on a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
UNICEF, Amnesty International and, in particular, the Canadian Bar Association are advocating the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can have a fair trial in Canada.
The same government closes its eyes to torture: it cares little that this young man is psychologically destroyed in the future, and no doubt permanently, after so many years of torture.
We don't realize it, but we are witnessing the creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom, and our "democracy," a word that Harper brandishes and that sounds so empty from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no longer any morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, mistreat him, imprison him at the whim of the head of the hitherto minority government (as will be the case after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that preaches Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, is in this renunciation and not elsewhere.
Opinions - The Orwellian Discourse of Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwellian logic, he confirms that the world's largest gold producer has launched a libel prosecution of three authors and a poor small publisher in order to provoke a "transparent public debate" and demands six million from them.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the law that judges truthfulness, especially in the case of libel prosecutions.
Unsurprisingly, Garver misses this crucial distinction entirely.
Or is Barrick Gold's best way to conduct public debate to bankrupt anyone who dares to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the outcome, the authors and publisher of Noir Canada will be forced to spend respectable sums to be prepared to defend and fight in a very uneven battle against an army of lawyers supported by the mine's almost bottomless pockets.
Indeed, the tactic in these unbalanced struggles often consists in ruining the defendants in order to enforce conciliation that shuts the mouths of the opposing party and, moreover, frightens anyone who dares to pursue the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have presented its view to public opinion.
Contrary to what happens in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada the debate is normally about exchanging ideas rather than blowing with a baton.
The mining companies therefore had no choice but to open up their books, their documentation, and to spark a real debate through newspapers, media, publications, and funding of independent scientific teams that could shed light on the matter.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have confidence in public opinion and is quick to reject petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he could demand "public debate" while contemptuous the views of the same public?
In the vice president's world, the word seems to refer only to boldly paid attorneys, and not to all Canadians; This is a rather narrow conception of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
Barrick Gold does not understand—or does not want to understand—that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so primarily because it rejects the mining company's brutal ways.
The public is ready to listen to Barrick and judge the matter, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not in what many perceive as a prosecution in which the defendant's mouth is to be shut (as part of its prosecution of the "public debate", Barrick, by the way, has just filed an official notice to the authors of Noir Canada to officially tell them to stop using the term...).
Garver's surreal speech aside, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university's freedom of inquiry and search for truth, which are essential to any democratic society.
Overall, it denies the right to cite reliable sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which constitute the very basis of intellectual activity.
If, in a country like Canada, it becomes impossible to study and discuss topics that the world's rich companies dislike without exposing ourselves to repeated prosecution, who else will?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have done so if it had followed the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He has the right to reply.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's over-the-top lawsuit makes it clear that, despite what it claims, it has no appetite for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as it is for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place measures to curb this type of wrongful prosecution.
Operation to save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
Yesterday, the Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally agreed on the biggest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the thirties.
A new version of the $700 billion plan to contain the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it envisages: better control of its application by elected representatives, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public money deposited, new measures for capturing the number of homes foreclosed due to default, as well as the right to monitor the level of wages paid to executives of rescued firms.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news yesterday a few minutes after midnight, after the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We've made great progress and we've come to an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Henry Paulson, an official in the Bush administration.
"Everything has been done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans are safe from the crisis that is happening on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"This is the crucial point: if we don't do that, the trauma, chaos and disruption to the daily lives of Americans will be enormous," said Rep. Judd Gregg, R-Fla.
Over the past few hours, negotiations have been in full swing for fear of the effect that another failure would have on investors' moods.
The specified time limit was the opening of the markets this morning.
Both candidates for the US presidency were invited to the negotiations later, and both expressed themselves in favour of an agreement, without neglecting to express their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has added some measures to the agreement, most notably one aimed at allowing owners to retain their homes and a measure on the wages of executives of state-rescued labor firms.
"When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate ourselves on.
But these measures are necessary," he explained on the airwaves of television.
His Republican rival, John McCain, who was asked by another network if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The rough outlines I've read [show] that this is something we're all going to have to digest and with which we can move forward.
Choosing inaction is simply unacceptable," he said.
The goal of the $700 billion plan is to buy up dubious debts and risky and unsellable assets of US financial institutions with taxpayers' money.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis triggered by the bursting of the housing bubble, which first led to the collapse of subprime mortgages, then spilled over to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in a cash freeze and the dismantling of banks and financial institutions.
The collapse of last week's first draft deal is due to Republican lawmakers.
Ever since the Democrats accepted that the government would only guarantee some of the "toxic" assets of troubled companies but not buy them back, the belief has been that the impasse is over.
In an effort to reconcile conflicting views in Congress, a provision was added stipulating that the government would be able to introduce new fees to help it recover its deposit if it had to take losses for five years as a result of the program.
The new plan envisages a first injection of $250 billion, to which another $100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
A further $350 billion is expected to be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for its help, Washington will acquire stakes in rescued companies that will pay it dividends if they make a profit, and which it can sell again when it is all over.
The federal government will have the option of delaying foreclosure procedures related to loans covered by the plan, as well as setting limits on the amount of remuneration and compensation paid to executives of affected companies.
The plan's architects would like to put it to a vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Yesterday, voices continued to rise against the project in both the Republican and Democratic camps.
"It's very clear that Washington doesn't hear you," said Rep. Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But making money off taxpayers is not the solution."
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of congressmen dubbed the "Committee of Skeptics," presents the matter differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred esteemed economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us: we ask Congress not to rush too much and to carefully examine which path to take," he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe has once again confirmed that this crisis is a world crisis.
At the end of the extraordinary meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (USD 16.3 billion).
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after French bank BNP Paribas announced it was pulling out of its purchase of its competitor, which is on the verge of collapse since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) to the subprime loan crisis in the United States.
Employing 85,000 people, Fortis is one of the twenty largest European banks and one of the ten largest insurers.
"We will not lose this money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
"In return, we get the right to vote in the bank and influence.
That is what savers and households can appreciate in these uncertain times."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seems to have begun nationalizing another bank hit by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than $41 billion ($75.5 billion) were loans for the purchase of real estate.
According to its announcement yesterday, the Spanish bank Santander will buy the branches and accounts of the British bank's clients.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalised by the British government since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a socially engaged icon
His beauty with azure eyes has long represented his trump card, according to others weakness.
Did this American actor break free from narcissism with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity and unflagging talent that possessed him also distanced him from the power category that produces real stars.
But what a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died Friday at 83 on his ranch in Connecticut from lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the fat years of American cinema.
Less spectacular than Brando, whom he resembled and had long been his rival on the big screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often begets beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and his mother was Hungarian.
From these European roots was born one of the famous faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because it saw this whole country in love with self-made man, a fighter in the Pacific War, wounded in battle, who studied acting at Yale in the early 50s, then visited New York's Actor's Studio and celebrated triumph in theater, television and soon in film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a race car driver who finished second at the 1979 Le Mans 24 Hours and a sex symbol, despite having formed a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him also leaves the dark places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the fuss of his own show-business, which will forever remain somewhat mysterious.
A decent man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend has caused film lovers to dizzy, as his big roles compete against each other on the black screen of memories.
After him, more than half a century of constantly changing American seventh art parades.
The charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) is remembered again, a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a Hot Roof, a 1958 adaptation of Tennessee Williams.
From a less distant past (1990) we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed at an advanced age by a marriage that did not live up to all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, the abused, violent, unforgettable delinquent in Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, taken over after his death that made Newman known in 1956.
A sympathetic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting, Oscar winner for Best Picture in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's amazing The Hustler (1961), he plays the same character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar out of seven nominations in 1987.
This face wandering through the ages, that was him.
And him again.
In his professional career, different eras compete with each other.
Young people know him mainly thanks to the cult Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 on the Coen brothers' The Hudsucker Proxy.
He ended his career as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike a few film legends who left the craft relatively early, Newman remained in the business for a long time, though he condemned Hollywood for its glitz, pomp and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "a living challenge of underplaying", judging that he pushed too hard in his performances.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom roles came on a platter, the profession was not always so tender.
But he played the first lovers less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, scoundrels, and desperadoes, whose decline and rebellion were reflected in his perfect features.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known sides of his shy sensibilities.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), starring his wife Joanne Woodward, presents a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
In 1984, he dedicated the 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of shame and sadness, to his son Scott, whom he lost to an overdose.
In the flurry of honors Newman received yesterday, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (who played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) sadly declared, "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of life, such are the main qualities of the deceased actor.
Aside from his legendary career, he is also leaving a great fighter for civil rights, ecology, independent film, opponent of the decline of Hollywood.
We used to see his likeness on bottles of wine vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, which we might find quite tasteless, although it was initially a gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to his Foundation for Difficult Childhood.
Rather than being lulled by fame, Newman became involved in society until the last moment.
He left a letter to his five daughters containing these sentences: "Always and to the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
I was honored to be here."
And it was an honor for us to follow the career of such a prescient and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in the invoice factory Zuschlag & Co.?
Soon, on 8 October, the trial will begin in the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates.
The politician and his associates are accused, among other crimes, including forgery of documents, of fraud committed over a long period of time and systematically by a criminal organisation, as a result of which extremely significant damage has been caused.
According to the prosecutor's office, they used the money obtained in public tenders for their own purposes and often documented the completion of tasks with fictitious invoices.
Money from the state and local authorities - a total of approximately 65 million forints - went partly into the coffers of Fiatal Baloldal, partly into the pockets of individuals.
The method, which was also reported by the investigating authority, was that the money obtained in public tenders was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no real consideration, and the undertakings entered into were never honoured.
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices were fake.
The forms for these invoices came from the Józsefváros market, the round stamps were made in Kiskunhalasi.
The names of the companies to be used for the production of invoices were decided, among other things, on a circular tour along the northern shore of Lake Balaton, on which István Lados was sent by János Zuschlag.
According to his testimony, the former should have sought out guesthouses and restaurants.
In them, he asked for bills for his consumption, according to the model of which invoices were then produced submitted within public tenders announced, inter alia, by the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, or the Self-Government of the Capital City.
Invoices were mostly issued by István Lados and his partner András Őri, who, according to our information, most often wrote the reports needed to obtain subsidies.
During his "study trip" Lados found a pub.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, that restaurant catered to a group of ninety from Biztos Pont.
However, according to the company's manager, so many people would not fit into this facility at once.
Similarly, an invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért, was rife with errors in form and content.
The guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one evening, yet the invoice stated one hundred and thirty guests.
However, the fillers of the forms with a rich imagination exaggerated it even when they mentioned on the documents a company also engaged in hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., in whose accounts, according to the information provided to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the documents in the names of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even appear.
The head of the company, Győző Farkas, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and shown the invoices, he immediately knew they were false documents.
"Our business name and tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp."
As he added, in addition to the formalities, the fact that, according to the invoice, they accommodated a hundred people, because they have only eleven rooms that do not have such a large capacity, did not agree.
In addition, the invoice also indicated meals, and their restaurant has not been operating for a long time.
Eager invoice makers were also not convinced that the Budapest travel agency of their choice was only organising foreign trips, and they foolishly stated the invoice with payment in cash, which was also not in line with the company's invoicing practice, as a travel mediation service within Hungary.
Moreover, as it emerged during the investigation, they also mentioned VAT in the document, even though the organisation of travel to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
On the four documents issued to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation by Hotel Révfülöp s.r.o., the amount of VAT was disagreed, inter alia. The company's activities are not subject to the 25% but to 15% VAT, and moreover, the hotel employees issued only printed invoices, but the invoice produced was handwritten.
In addition, the "issuers" spoiled the invoice, for example, by stating in the case of one company, as it turned out thanks to an investigation by the public prosecutor's office, as an activity performed by road transport of goods, which the company originally based on investment advice did not perform.
The fact that the invoices issued to the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért foundations and to XXI Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false has also come to light because of formal anomalies - an inconsistent invoice format and a false stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k.s. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that they had issued the invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not notice that HIB s.r.o. from Nyíregyháza was in liquidation at the time (2001) when the Fiatal Városért group was eating there, which is why, according to our information, the liquidation commissioner of the company also denied that he had issued the paper.
They issued invoices consciously
The second group of invoicers consists of those who knew that they had to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Eséla Budapestért Foundation issued accounts worth around four million forints for the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták.
According to the indictment, the head of Collab s.r.o. was forced to issue a fictitious account by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Zuschlag and his associates were also assisted by Biogate s.r.o., currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied the Jobb Jövőért Foundation and the Atlasz and Vörösfenyő associations with invoices worth around five million forints, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Not even the movement of money, because the created invoices were later canceled, which, of course, the organizations forgot to mention in their documents.
Another group of invoicing firms includes those that had ties to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was an authorized representative of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió s.r.o., a company engaged in trading in fuel and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, where the company is not to be found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of IT equipment worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the information established by the investigation, these invoices were bought by the Kiskunhalas company Cash Investment s.r.o., which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The managing director of this company was a man from Romania, to whom Iván Kubatov was also supposed to hand over documents concerning the company in 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppá and the Együtt Foundation and the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation and had himself accepted their consideration.
At the request of Iván Kubatov, the Romanian bricklayers founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
In fact, none of the companies operated, according to the defendant, because they did not get jobs.
Nevertheless, the undertakings benefited him since, at the request of the co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szente, who had also prepared their founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations Atlasz and Y-Generáció linked to Zuschlaga.
On behalf of Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave the organizations a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The prosecutor's office concluded that Kubatov had earned 10 percent of the amounts stated on the invoices and VAT.
To issue fictitious invoices, this time for a tender for the Biztos Pont association, the man also used the company Szi-Beri k. t.
In January 2006, the associations Y-Generáció and Szövetség and Modern Magyarországért submitted proposals for a public tender for the Mihály Táncsics Foundation (TMA), a public benefit organisation of the Socialist Party.
They received 500,000 forints each, but did not spend the amounts on the targets specified in the proposals.
To avoid this, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s.r.o.
Those invoices were also found during a search of Árpád Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, some of the defendants will probably describe the process of production of invoices, as they have already done at the prosecutor's office.
It may be more interesting if the main defendant, János Zuschlag, decides to reveal everything himself.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has promised several times that he will explain everything at length, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for paying a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, perhaps the socialists have made a deal with him and Zusi will take it upon himself.
In the meantime, he may have been offended, as his requests for relaxation of the conditions of his detention, namely to place him under house arrest, have so far gone unheeded.
While economic criminals, who have done much more damage that they have not yet paid, are free to walk around or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have this option.
The psychology of trumping: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overvalue goods.
The neurological and economic underpinnings of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been uncovered by researchers in the fields of neurology and economics at New York University.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people don't want to fall behind in a competition like eBay, so they'd rather pay too high a price.
The research used an experimental auction to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers bet, the other group participated in a live-action auction, where the active brain areas of the test subjects were examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
In both games, participants could win money, but when playing at an auction, the important element of which is to trump the other side, a unit located under the cerebral cortex, called the striatum, began to work intensively when losing.
This brain region, among many other functions, plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system.
According to the researchers, the price increase can therefore be explained by an effort to avoid a violent reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, members of the research team from the ranks of economists conducted a financial cross-sectional survey.
Under different conditions, three groups bid against one partner.
The control group was simply told what the fair value of the product was, and they made bets.
In addition, members of another group were promised that if they came out victorious, they would receive an additional $15 as a reward.
The third group received $15 before the auction, but if they lost, their members also lost that money.
The difference between the two groups, then, was that one was emphasized to win and the other to lose.
However, the "against losing" group members were willing to go higher than in the control and "winning" groups, confirming the neurologists' hypothesis.
"These results cannot be deduced from any pre-existing economic theory.
Until now, they have explained the phenomena observable in auctions by the joy of victory and risk avoidance.
Only neurological imaging has helped us resolve the contradiction between the two theories so that we have now arrived at a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at New York University's School of Economics.
Hepatitis: when to consult a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed as the leading cause of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are being treated. The reason for this is that the sick often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a collective name for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, hepatitis and jaundice, but the causative agents of the disease and the diseases caused by them differ from each other.
Depending on the causative agent, hepatitis viruses spread in two main ways: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal secretions, saliva).
In any case, travellers should protect themselves by vaccination against virus A and B, there is no vaccine against the type C virus.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after ingestion of infected food, usually they are accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal discomfort, urge to vomit.
After that, jaundice forms on the skin and whites of the eyes, the stool lightens and urine darkens. Treatment can last up to two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people die worldwide from a more serious type of disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only one in ten infected people is medically treated.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, the causative agent of the disease destroys liver cells insidiously, so the first symptoms appear in many cases after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, carrying out regular screening is very important.
In three groups, the disease occurs much more frequently than average: among people who had blood transfusions before 1991, among drug users and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated global number of individuals infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since the disease can be demonstrated by routine laboratory tests, a person should contact his general practitioner if he notices any symptoms of unknown origin.
With early detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body to prevent contagiousness and prevent cancer.
30 September is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organised globally by organisations representing patients in 2004.
Its aim is to draw attention to the chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of its occurrence and the importance of early recognition of the disease.
Benelux governments to nationalise part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux countries will help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to run into trouble due to the spreading effect of the US mortgage market crisis, with partial nationalisation: three countries will support a financial and insurance institution, which also has a capital stake in Hungary, with €11.2 billion.
This was agreed at the highest level this weekend by the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch Governments, attended by the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis is the first in the euro area to be plunged into a major crisis in the context of the crisis of the international financial markets, which has been spreading in waves for more than a year, and the decisions taken on this matter could, from a certain point of view, be seen as precedents.
Under the decision, which was made on Sunday night, all three states will buy out nearly half (49 percent) of the bank's assets.
The bank will most certainly sell part of its equity holdings, especially - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Fortis shares began to fall sharply last week, and in the second half of the week there were already serious signs of a crisis in the institute.
But analysts agree that with 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to fail.
The company's stock fell 12 percent on Friday alone, to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current share prices, the Group's total market capital value is around €14 billion, but according to company executives, this is unrealistic.
Indeed, the company's management blames the fall in Fortis shares on the uncertainty in the overseas market related to the adoption of the plan of the US package worth $ 700 billion.
On Monday, the shares rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx, a new CEO, was appointed as the head of the bank.
The bank was also looking for private buyers, but no one has yet come forward with a serious offer.
The Belgian government has previously announced that investors need not worry, they will not lose their money.
Panic has not yet broken out among the bank's clients, and branches have not been taken by storm.
Fortis Bank has a separate branch in Hungary and has also acquired several leasing companies.
Who believes in God, doesn't it hurt so much?
According to recent research, belief in God acts as an analgesic that may have eased the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists from the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examining how belief in a god affects the perception of pain in humans, the British newspaper Telegraph reported.
In a rather bizarre survey, 12 Catholic worshippers and an equal number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while they all observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, the Catholic faithful were able to eliminate much of the pain.
Thanks to a technique that examined the human brain in detail, it turned out that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
The research is the first in a series of investigations involving academics, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university.
Exactly the test was carried out by attaching a sparking instrument to the left hand of the test subject, which emitted electric shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to stare at two paintings: Sassoferrat's Virgin Mary from the 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci's Lady with an Ermine, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke a certain state of piety in the faithful, while they chose da Vinci's painting because it is not very different from the first and has a calming impression.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner and during this time received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive sessions, while separately viewing a religious or general image.
Catholics reported that they felt "safe" at the sight of the Virgin Mary, as if they were "taken care of" and "calmed down, filled with peace."
When they watched a religious painting, they said they felt 12 percent less pain than when they had Leonardo's work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful image for atheists, as long as you need to find the right photo.
"We would have to find an image that they would perceive very positively, from the position of a mother or father," the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the findings.
"Practicing faith should and in many cases will change our personality," Wright added.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on regulating the pain of the faithful if they showed them a Madonna by Leonardo or a painter of similar caliber.
Would looking at a quality Virgin Mary mean achieving even better results?
You are what you share of yourself
On its tenth birthday, Google can claim that people can find it in their pockets at least as well as in the sky overhead; They know where they have been on holiday, what professional examinations they go to and what interests them.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's CEOs, that's still not enough.
But when it comes to skeptics drawing parallels with Orwellian dark vision, the very nature of Web 2.0 is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary for Google's founders to stick to their original purpose, which was, "Let's organize all the information in the world!"
According to a Google official, even after ten years of world-class work, the company is only at the beginning of being able to work with all the information.
When asked what will happen in five years, Schmidt said he would like Google to be able to answer questions such as "what should I do tomorrow?" or "what kind of work would be useful for me?" - such seemingly simple questions that software will not be able to answer until it knows enough about users.
Not all Internet users are well aware that Internet searches accurately capture the search words, from which IP address they were searched for and to which pages the interested parties moved after the search.
Thanks to the Personalized Search service, launched two years ago, users can, for example, keep their surfing history, they can look back at what they searched for and what they clicked, which in the long run generates findings that are much more tailored to them - the same logic will be used to base the Recommendations service, through which the system will offer us products and services based on previously indicated and retained preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I do? - ask users who are afraid at the sight of Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company is more frightening, the counter-reaction does not evoke in Internet users a sense of guilt, fear of punishment, a desire for freedom, or even a rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all search terms are not only intercepted, but in justified cases may also be issued to a third party, in such legal cases the personality rights of Internet users are not protected.
Perhaps the best-known recent example was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that allowed the identification of pedophiles from Orkut's community sites.
Internet users concerned about personality rights could breathe a sigh of relief in May when the company, hand in hand with the electronic rights organization EFF, successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI: Google must not be compelled by any constitutional article to provide any information secretly requested to the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully won nearly fifty thousand web addresses and a thousand search terms, citing the strengthening of the Child Protection Act passed years ago, but failed to get individual user search lists, or complete lists of websites and keywords spanning a two-month period.)
Opinion about Google is thus quite contradictory: it is being whipped by those who are afraid of giving up their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be harmed by starting to use Google's services, and they are acting against it with the revolt that belongs to multinationals with a conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and its wild offshoot, gathering around it enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users appearing in many countries, see in it a new generation of big business, a "corporation that is now in the works," unlike its rival Microsoft, considered the conqueror of the world because of Windows, even though they both fight for the same goals.
This may be due to the fact that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require an identification code from its users and does not ask them to pay for its applications; An open, free and constantly fresh source of information and package of programs comes across as much more accessible, youthful, "cool" than the practice of the official software giant.
However, it may also be due to the fact that geeks understand exactly the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personality rights, which has brought with it one of the most talked about keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about nothing more than collaboration, about deliberately leaving traces behind us and using the communication channels at our disposal, and although their scope is different for everyone, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can maintain a profile on several community sites from Facebook to Xanga, which they can easily connect with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm app that records the music they listen to, all of which they can then connect to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, in addition to writing a blog where their latest photo galleries will automatically appear.  which he stores on Flickr or Picas.
At the same time, we can read about a lot of exemplary cases that emerge: a girlfriend in the morning, looking at a flood of photos of mutual friends, easily discovers who her deceiving boyfriend spent the evening with, or a company can fire its employee just because she describes her honest opinion about the top management on her blog: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has been completely rethought today.
Whoever lives an online life consists of what he shows of himself, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today's youth.
And those who want to conceal something or at least avoid the Google monopoly have the option (starting with Scroogle, which uses Google's search system, but deliberately leaves no traces).
For example, a significant number of people deliberately do not register on community pages so that they cannot be found. Google's online apps, from a text editor to a photo editor and news portal, can be replaced with alternative versions that aren't connected to giant server parks and that don't build the best possible profile out of us.
Public opinion is not very secretly waiting for Google to show its teeth.
With its current value of $156 billion, the company is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising space is at risk for ad agency investment, and services introduced at an ever-accelerating pace are seriously making life difficult not only for Microsoft but also for many other software designers.
But critical observers also find counterpoints that are disturbing: for example, top management completely rejected employee protests after doubling the fee for a company nursery, arbitrarily frequent daily meals for employees were too expensive, according to management, but all this is lost in addition to the fact that Google bowed to the Chinese government in 2006 and filters out every finding under their agreement.  which is contrary to the good taste, or rather the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that it never advertises new services in advance until they can be used, but what is certain is that the expected problems of the coming months and years could shake the world in new places: while some believe that Google's project to scan and archive books and magazines is becoming so large that the company will soon have to deal with the US Supreme Court.  others are terrified of her Health system, where we can build a complete health profile of our own with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is compiling a genetic database can serve as a good starting point for generations of science fiction writers, Cory Doctorow's famous novel "Scroogled" describes with Orwellian reminiscences a future in which humans can be intimidatingly well approached only with data from Google.
The two-time murderer from Ózd was helped to remove the tracks by two juveniles
Two juveniles were questioned by police in the case of a double murder in Ózd, according to reasonable suspicion they helped to remove traces of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod County High Police Directorate said on Tuesday.
The persons confessed to the activity of which they were suspected and are currently charged with aiding and abetting a crime.
Both juveniles, two girls, according to MTI, are being prosecuted at large.
Aiding and abetting a crime is punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double murder in Ode, a 23-year-old man there, was taken into provisional custody on Sunday.
He is suspected of the crime of pre-planned multiple murders for selfish reasons.
During the investigation, it emerged that the 23-year-old young man owed the 53-year-old a larger amount.
The suspect did not want to repay his debt, so he lured his creditor to an establishment in Ózd last Wednesday, where he killed first the man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man had prepared in advance for the crime to be committed, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are being investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange makes an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a hundred percent package of shares in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side, despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the group of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
As the Czech economic daily E15 writes, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount that has been offered to bidders for the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to Czech newspapers, bids have so far been submitted by the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic Nasdaq Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all bidders, and did not rule out that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at CZK 5-10 billion.
Under the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold off.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25 percent share, followed by Česká spořitelna with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their Tuesday commentaries on the deepening international financial crisis, leading European newspapers already recall the "second September 11".
We can thank the US president for the global financial catastrophe, accuses Rome's La Repubblica. The president has not even been able to rally his own party in support of the hastily slapped bill aimed at remedying this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which billionaire investor Warren Buffett resembled, we could talk about a second September 11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees Washington as the culprit.
In El Mundo's view, the world's economy has been brought to the brink of collapse by its lack of political leadership.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system continues to grow, for which the whole world will eventually pay.
While Bush's plan was not perfect, the congressional vote threatens that Washington will not offer a political tool for resolving the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air at the very moment when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, points out the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
Individual states can still throw a lifeline to staggering financial institutions, and taxpayers can save them from failure.
But if other banks collapse like dominoes, then neither money nor further improvisation will suffice.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to move beyond their national egoism and consolidate control over the fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, the struggling financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros, notes Vienna's Der Standard, according to which fears that, like the Americans, European taxpayers will have to dig deep into their pockets to solve the crisis are becoming increasingly real.
Until now, the European Union has not seriously addressed the crisis that is sweeping the old continent like a tsunami.
The "rescuers" do not have to wave hundreds of billions of euros right away, but it would be good if they firmly established when it is wise to reach for taxpayers' money in order to prevent even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of a bumblebee
What would be the best method of developing technologies capable of avoiding collisions, if not imitating obstacle detectors found in the natural world?
For example, in bees.
The initial strategic idea of the surprise project, presented at the Japanese CEATEC trade fair, was suggested to Nissan engineers by bumblebees. It was about building a new generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has designed the BR23C, a robotic minicar equipped with bee properties, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
"During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety protective cover," explained Kazuhiro Doi, the brand's general manager for technology PR and R&D.
An important role is played by compound eyes, which allow bees to see in all directions in a viewing angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the compound eye, engineers reached for the idea of a laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles up to 2 meters in front of the BR23C in a field of view of 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately converted into an operation to avoid a collision.
The obstacle is caught within a fraction of a second, then the robotic car begins to imitate the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to avoid a collision.
Unlike any existing system, this evasive maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive manner.
"If this were not the case, the robotic car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and Robotic Car Project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology suits the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the security containment, within which a collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must take no longer than the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be turned.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees when dodging, the robotic car has only been able to rotate, accelerate and decelerate.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, what is important is instinctive, intelligent response, not the ability to process, much less store data.
This mechanism has to process and respond to only a few incoming signals per second.
There is no need for it to store and react using intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it only uses a few kilobytes of memory at all times.
It doesn't need gigabyte or megabyte memory.
It's the first step towards developing instant avoidance technology that Nissan estimates could make its way into production cars within a decade.
Another possibility of application can be the connection of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding obstacles lying in the way, would lead the motorist to the specified final destination.
Damn expensive child already has a name
The $700 billion economic rescue package bill, which is to be divided into several installments and aims to buy back low-quality bank loans, has already been written.
In the first round, half of the amount will be used.
After further negotiations that ended just after midnight US Eastern Time on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement in several days of debate on a $700 billion bailout package, Reuters reported.
"We've made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, who said all that remained was to write a deal.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Commenting on the outcome of the compromise, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said: "The programme will work and be effective, but more needs to be done."
The written form of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. Washington time (i.e. Monday at two o'clock in the morning Central European Time), but it did not cause any particular rise in the stock exchanges.
The 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which establishes the program, will be voted on Monday first by the House of Representatives, then by the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, after which news of the deal was welcomed at the White House.
"We are pleased with the progress made last night and greatly appreciate the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
Indeed, the program differs from the Bush administration's original proposal, which called for the entire $700 billion to be spent at once to buy low-quality mortgage-backed securities.
It is now possible to spend a maximum of half of $700 billion in the first round, with $250 billion being used immediately after Congress is expected to make a decision on Monday and the Treasury to buy mortgage-backed securities that are judged to be of poor quality, the fate of the remaining $100 billion depending on the president's decision.
The program will be controlled by a special body, whose member will also be the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank.
The spending of the second half of $700 billion will depend on further decision by Congress.
The Ministry of Finance can use a combined tactic within the meaning of the law: it can simultaneously buy low-quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, or other "poisonous" loans.
The buyout can take place in auctions or directly, ministry officials said.
The law will allow the firms concerned to participate in an insurance scheme in which the Ministry of Finance provides them with a guarantee for funds constituting cause for concern, in return for which the companies will pay a price commensurate with the amount of expected damages.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary resources to spend up to $700 billion to meet the urgent demands of the US financial system, whether it is to buy the wrong funds on a large scale, to insure them, or to prevent the systemic risk associated with the collapse of a large financial institution.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, the heads of banks that are in trouble and are waiting for help from the state can count on the government to reduce their severance pay - which in overseas slang is simply called a "golden parachute".
Their disbursements will be limited only in certain cases, and these restrictions will depend on the method of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The restriction essentially means that if the ministry buys at auction, a tax surcharge will be imposed on the golden parachutes unless the fallen bank directors are sent straight into retirement.
In the case of direct purchases of low-quality loans, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the money for management is not excessive.
It should be added that the already existing contracts on golden parachutes will not change, the restriction applies only to new contracts, which should be an additional incentive to participate in the program.
"This is the first time in U.S. history that there will be a legal restriction on CEO compensation," said Barney Frank, Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
In addition, the State will have the right to acquire a stake in the banks participating in the programme, thereby reducing the risk for taxpayers, since once the economy, and with it the rescued bank, is on its feet, they can also profit from the transaction.
The bill includes that over the next five years, the president must submit a proposal to Congress setting out how taxpayers can recover expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course, there were also voices on both sides expressing doubts about the plan.
"That's not what the American people asked us to do, because that's not going to protect taxpayers' dollars," said Republican Congressman from California Darrell Issa.
His Ohio Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, believes that the very people responsible for the collapse of Wall Street urged the provisions to pass.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007, the Central Statistical Office reported.
Export sales prices in industry were higher by 1.1 percent compared to July 2008, down 3.9 percent year-on-year.
Producer prices in industry were higher by 0.7 percent compared to the previous month as a cause of changes in domestic and export prices, rising by 3.2 percent year-on-year.
Domestic sales prices in industry rose only minimally compared to the previous month, by 0.1 percent.
Domestic sales prices in manufacturing sectors also increased slightly by 0.1 percent compared to July.
The largest price increases in August 2008 were recorded in the leather and footwear sector (2.8 percent), mainly due to a month-on-month increase in prices in the leather and saddlery sector and 2.6 percent respectively.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly price increase in the chemical materials and products sector (1.6 percent).
Price reductions occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4 percent), electrical machinery and appliances (0.9 percent), as well as - to a minimal extent - in the woodworking sector (0.1 percent).
Prices in the papermaking sector and publishing and printing activities remained unchanged.
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, we measured price increases in the range of 0.2 to 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sectors, which have a strong weight in domestic industrial sales, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the continuing impact of the officially determined increase in gas prices from 1 July.
In a twelve-month comparison of domestic sales in individual branches of the manufacturing industry, prices increased the most in the professional oil processing sector (32.4 percent).
A 13.2% increase in prices could be observed in the metalworking sector, while an 11% increase in prices could be observed in the production of food, beverages and tobacco products, which has a decisive weight.
Price reductions occurred in the textiles and textile products (2.5 percent) and electrical machinery and apparatus (0.3 percent) sectors.
In other manufacturing sectors, the rate of price growth ranged between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing sector rose by 10.2 percent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water generation and distribution sectors exceeded prices from the previous year by 18.7 percent.
In terms of industry focus, domestic sales in August showed the highest monthly price increase (0.7 percent) in the tangible asset production industries.
In the consumer goods industries, prices rose by 0.3 percent, while in the energy processing and processing industries, prices were unchanged from the previous month.
The largest price increase compared to the same month of the previous year in August 2008 could be observed in the energy industries (16.8 percent).
In the consumer goods sectors, we measured a price increase of 6.8 percent, while for tangible assets, we measured a decrease in prices of 1.4 percent.
Export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, falling by 3.9 percent in a twelve-month comparison.
In one month, our domestic currency depreciated by 1.7 percent against the euro, by 7.1 percent against the dollar, by 7.5 percent relative to the euro compared to August 2007 and by 15.9 percent against the dollar.
Coming to the United States without a visa next year?
According to Kinga Göncz, there is a great chance that the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force around January 12, the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about it in Chicago in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her opinion, "now almost everything depends on whether an electronic system of permitting trips or checks is built overseas in time."
At the same time, she warned that the new system will not include entry permits, but tourists will have to register before leaving.
The representative of Hungarian diplomacy continues negotiations in Washington from today.
He will meet Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will present the Middle Cross with the star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and hold talks with foreign policy advisers to Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of a bank rescue package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major US parties, on Sunday reaffirmed their support for the government's $700 billion bank bailout package, but there are also politicians who are demanding the resignation of the Treasury secretary.
After several days of marathon negotiations between Congress and administration officials, it was announced early Sunday morning: a basic agreement had been reached on a bank rescue package.
The financial package, which aims to reshape the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become a central issue in the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain agree that the better of the two candidates would lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, as economic issues have come to the fore, Obama has regained some advantage, blurring the McCain lead he secured after the Republican convention by nominating Sarah Palin for vice president.
Obama expressed hope at a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday that the $700 billion package bill would be quickly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages relating to consumer protection, which he also supports.
"We must act now, responsibly (...) Your jobs, your savings, your entire industries, the stability of the entire economy are in danger," he told a crowd of 35,000.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas about economics outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain explained: "Everybody's going to be a little bit resentful (...) But doing nothing just isn't the way to go."
As the Republican senator put it, the proposal includes the establishment of a commission to oversee the Treasury secretary and the severance pay limits for top officials he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not have a major role in the negotiations, but that he was in daily contact with the secretary of state.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that the House of Representatives will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
German-language press overview
The right-wing camp is intact, only voters within it have become more confident - this is how Der Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
The Haiderians are ready to rule Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter, in an article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Devours Its Fathers," discusses the causes of the CSU's dramatic defeat.
According to a well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian Socialists have been rebuilding Bavaria for decades - and now it is these modern citizens who are turning away from them.
Changing periods is a problem for the whole of Christian Democracy, and thus for Angela Merkel.
The debacle was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday ended a process that could have been expected for almost exactly ten years: the undisputed hegemony of one state party.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, the first time since the 50s that it was below the 50 percent mark.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, still in the oft-remembered Stoiber period.
The reason for this is the modernization that the CSU has consistently carried out in that country, and which is eating away at its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong about the pace. Secularization, educational outcomes, and the settlement of Germans from the east and north in the developing regions of Bavaria could not, however, be without consequences for the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization is associated with an increase in possibilities, which also has visible political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters within it have become more confident, critical, headstrong.
It is also clear that in recent weeks the CSU has moved furthest away from the classical civic classes; Freelancers, sole traders, individuals with A-level examination and university education.
By then, support for the CSU has shrunk below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese daily writes in an article titled "Who, with whom? Party leaders are reticent about coalition," he said, referring to the confused internal political situation created by the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits SPÖ interference in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ appears to be open to all negotiations, the Greens do not yet want to agree on a coalition.
The elections are over, now everything revolves around the coalition; In the debate held on public television, the party leaders did not allow much insight into their cards.
SPÖ leader Werner Faymann confirmed that he wished to negotiate with the ÖVP.
And the SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is certainly possible - it exists in some federal states and in social partnerships.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor.
As he put it, the Schüssel-Molterer course was outvoted in any case.
Repeating this direction is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins a coalition is still completely open within the party, and these issues need to be discussed decisively within the ÖVP.
Once again, BZÖ chairman Jörg Haider appeared open in all directions.
"To prevent a red-black coalition, we are ready to take government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóková: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Equality Summit, hosted this year by France, the current presiding country of the European Union, began today in Paris.
In her message to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, a Fidesz MEP for the European People's Party, drew attention to segregation in education, as one of the main speakers of expert deliberations addressed to the plenary, as it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Roma children and, moreover, the most serious obstacle to their application.
The summit was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civic associations active in the field of equal opportunities were invited to deliberate.
According to the press office of a group of Fidesz MEPs, Járóka pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination that occurs in recruitment, Romani people are being pushed out of the European labor market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have secondary education, and as a result of the poor quality of basic education, only a tiny fraction of them can achieve a higher level of education."
Járóka further stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a key role to play in the realisation of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MP, it is necessary to confirm the awareness of these connections in the widest circles - among Romani and non-Romani children.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the better his chances of becoming a productive member of the labor market; Through income taxes and excise taxes, they contribute to the national budget.
"Romani people need to secure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their low-quality and separate education," Járóková said.
According to the MEP, the cohesion of the European Union is needed, with an emphasis on objective and action, in order to immediately accelerate the processes of school desegregation, for which proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations is of paramount importance.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, it is necessary to provide Romani children with the opportunities given by the democratic space to participate as full citizens in the future of Europe," Járóková demanded.
Everyone is guaranteed the objective of the European Equality Summit, held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, to provide an autonomous forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination set at European and national level.
Fox in the chicken coop
Life and health insurance companies in America often dismiss the possibility of taking out an insurance contract with a bidder based on people's drug purchase data.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that links the use of prescription data in each case to the consent of the person concerned.
It has to be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we're entrusting the chicken coop to a fox," said Richard Dick, author of a program designed to track prescriptions.
Insurance companies make premiums and amounts paid in the event of claims dependent on the health of the candidates, and if the risk is assessed as too great, they will not even take out insurance with it.
Previously, they sent people for medical examinations and concluded contracts only when they knew the results.
Ten years ago, Dick devised a much cheaper procedure: based on an identification number, the customer can easily find out from pharmacies what drugs the person has bought in the last year and a half, from which the program itself deduces what disease he suffers from and what his state of health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it refers to the fact that he has a virtually uncontrollably high level of blood fats, which immediately puts him in the higher risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some of them also determine the risk coefficient at the same time, so the insurance company has almost no work left except paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include that some drugs can be used for several purposes, some compounds are usable, for example, against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
From the point of view of commercial insurance companies, these represent a significant factor in increasing risk, whereas the former are not.
In order to request and process the data, special companies have been set up to ask the patient for permission before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies.
They are now being forced to do so by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their previous negligence.
Some companies have recently been processing the results of laboratory tests, which they combine with data on the drugs used, thanks to which they can provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, while controlling its use will become increasingly difficult.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effectiveness applies only to health service providers and insurance companies.
A bill that will give authorities the power to audit businesses specializing in providing data is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: he has therefore developed his programme in such a way that the transfer of data is subject to the explicit consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that it is difficult for the person concerned to refuse authorisation, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
So the hens are still somewhat dependent on the fox's goodwill.
CSU: temporary pardon
The fate of the outgoing Huber-Beckstein duo will be decided at the end of October
Despite the shameful electoral debacle, heads have not yet fallen, the debate on personal issues has been adjourned by the top of the Bavarian CSU.
Party leader Erwin Huber and state premier Günther Beckstein can still remain in their posts, the question is when this pardon will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent loss of votes, will be decided by an extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of the much-criticized duo have said that they will not cling to their positions with all their might.
They tried to calm the angry members of the faction and base who, due to the loss of the absolute majority, demanded personal consequences the day after the "Bavarian tsunami".
Five years ago - true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the Christian Social Union won 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it was only able to get 43.4 percent.
The CSU was an "autocrat" in Bavaria, which produces 18 percent of Germany's GDP, for 46 years.
While the conservatives continue to have a high position in the southern state, which is crucial for the Hungarian economy, they will in any case be forced into a coalition in the future.
One of the first signs of a reorganization within the party is the fact that deputy chairman and Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, who is considered a possible successor to Huber, will be part of the close intelligence team that will begin probe talks on a possible coalition between the Munich government and the liberal FDP, or the right-wing Free Voters.
Ironically, Gabriele Pauli entered the Assembly on the Free Voters' list, whose anti-Stoiber performance was used by the Huber-Beckstein duo to carry out a coup, but then ruthlessly short trial with the ambitious local politician.
CSU leaders are now concentrating all their energies on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition period, Stoiber, who until now has been weaving threads from the background, will also play an active role, with the former state premier and former CSU chairman calling September 28 the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some scathing remarks about the CDU, saying they deserved much more support from their sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor unless the CSU, which played a major role in the 2005 national success, somehow gets back on its feet.
According to Merkel, who had a hard time hiding her disappointment because of the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on Berlin's grand coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: it will not be easier to treat the wounded CSU, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD achieved its weakest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6 percent.
Lukashenko:opposition - 110:0
In Sunday's election, not a single opposition MP got into the Belarusian parliament.
This can be explained, according to Russian observers, by the prosperity and stability prevailing in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but by the illegalities that occurred during the counting of votes, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the 110-member legislature of the country of 10 million has lacked opposition for a good decade, the opposition, united under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS), had seriously hoped before yesterday's election that Lukashenko, who had his presidential mandate renewed for a fourth time in a controversial election in 2006 on the basis of a constitutional amendment, would "allow" several opposition MPs to appear in parliament this time.
The ODS thus abandoned the previously considered boycott.
Behind the opposition's expectation was that Belarus, which was increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which took credit to mitigate the impact of Russia's ever-increasing price imports of natural gas and contributed to bringing Beltransgaz, which owns pipelines passing through the country, into Russian hands - wished to improve relations with the European Union, where the Belarusian political system, rated as anti-democratic, Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians, do not receive entry permits.
The relaxation was previously pointed out that the OSCE, in its assessment of the election campaign, emphasized positive shifts and not shortcomings - for example, the ban on candidacies for a third of opposition candidates.
Monday's flash report by the OSCE, however, also had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates were virtually barred from appearing in the press, especially the fact that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
At the same time, according to the opposition, an improvement can be felt in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to engage in minor confrontations with Moscow, continuing to refuse to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which breaks away from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a union state on paper, has considered these two territories independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that a dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Aleksandr Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain so, even though "the power was afraid to let a single member of the opposition into an insignificant parliament."
Looking at the results, the opposition is not planning industrial action, but rather trying to deliver its message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print opposition papers in Russia, distribution is being hindered by local authorities, but I still see that more and more people support the change, even among the elderly," Milinkevich said, pointing out that Lukashenko's regime, which considers the creation of social security to be its greatest achievement, is not considered right even by the most officially supported strata of pensioners.
"Because of the country's indebtedness and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before social security 'inducing cemetery silence' collapses," Milinkevich said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers rated the election as democratic.
The head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Sergei Lebedev, told Russia's RIA Novosti news agency that "people do not believe words, but deeds," so the absence of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Global Marseille Menu
European Union and India to double trade turnover
As the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this topic topped the agenda of the ninth Summit, among other, mostly global, problems.
There will also be a Franco-Indian summit today, which will mainly focus on cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given a greater say in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to find a common denominator in supporting New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This issue was not discussed further at yesterday's ninth summit, held in Marseilles.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, respectively the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, and the High Representative for Foreign Policy, Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed that the turnover of trade would double within five years, or increase to more than one hundred billion euros.
Given that trade in goods rose from $25 billion to $55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious target.
As a sign of this, twenty-six bilateral agreements already existing with India on civil aviation have been legally aligned, so that air transport has also been given the green light for the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised that negotiations would be accelerated.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit also paid attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism - which both sides condemned in all its forms and called for the urgent convening of a UN conference.
They have also urged the conclusion of the Doha Round of trade negotiations, although both have played a large part in its failure so far.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate programme, namely that it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agreed with this, as well as that next year's climate conference would require a global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by fifty percent by 2050.
Both sides would also like to prevent food price increases and support the convening of an international conference to analyse the financial crisis.
India's prime minister will travel to the French capital today to conclude a deal on the peaceful uses of atomic energy during a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that French companies will be commissioned to build India's twenty billion euro nuclear reactors.
According to agency reports, the agreement would be valid for 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Large participation of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is expecting more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred and one different countries at this edition, occupying 171,790 square meters of the fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as the guest of honor.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inauguration ceremony in the Italian Pavilion: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – on 264 square meters of exhibition space.
This will be followed by a meeting with the press in Room Struktur Buchmesse in Hall 5.0: an opportunity to present figures, tendencies and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors in relation to the overall Italian production is constantly decreasing, mainly with regard to literature for children and adults.
Brunette: "From now on, breakfast before work"
It is the first time in the history of Chigi Palace that revolving doors have been introduced for the arrival and departure of employees.
However, from today this new measure will start to work against cunning people, against those who take a bite and then go for coffee during working hours.
The novelty against lazy people was introduced today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Mauro Masi.
"Revolving doors," says Brunetta, "are a tool for better work, higher performance, more presence and more service," he said.
"A new era of accountability and transparency will now open.
This is reformism," Brunetta stresses.
With Chigi Palace, we will complete the implementation in all buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view."
There were no objections from the staff, assures the Secretary General: "It was a joint procedure with the staff and cooperation of all."
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; No more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "there's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at seven o'clock in the morning."
During one conference at the College for Public Administration
in Rome, the minister finally announces that within three months the absence of public employees due to illness has decreased by 50%, that is, by 60,000 more people per year at work."
And he will add that it is necessary to make the Italian public administration more efficient
"Its payout dynamics," the minister explains, "have doubled in the last 8-10 years relative to the private sector and are far higher than the inflation percentage."
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees gathered to reject the norms of the Brunette Decree in accordance with the request supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Administration will present figures today regarding reduced absenteeism due to illness – writes the consumer protection association – the nation of 'diligent idlers' is constantly growing.
In Italy we have thousands of productive and correct employees in the public administration who have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree."
Tara will protest primarily against the exclusion of sickness benefit allowances, which depend on activity; extending the period within which it is possible to check the patient, within what time interval visits will be carried out, and against other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: 'Resolute prevention'
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 accidents at work, three people die and twenty-seven remain permanently disabled.
The Inail values confirm that in 2007 we have about 1,200 deaths due to accidents at work.
These figures testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
In order to reawaken the attention of institutions, social and information resources on this dramatic problem, Anmil today celebrates the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents at Work, set for the second Sunday in October, in all Italian regions.
"The disturbing data disseminated by Anmil and the same tragic news these days confirm the importance of the issue of occupational safety," confirms President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in a message sent to President Anmilu, National Association for the Mutilated and Disabled for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his lively admiration for the continued joint efforts for safety in the workplace, for the protection of injured workers, for assistance to the families of the victims and for the participation of public opinion."
"Naturally, an outraged 'enough' has been raised, sincerely shared in the face of tragedies which, by their magnitude, cause a stir in the media and the participation of public opinion, but everyday reality once again offers us dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamics."
Napolitano makes no secret of the fact that "there is undoubtedly a resource problem: investing in training and information is crucial.
Of particular importance are the numerous initiatives promoted in the field of education to give young people facing the world of work a clearer awareness.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its worrying social seriousness, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the president of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, emphasized "how the phenomenon of death as a result of an accident at work creates an absolutely critical social condition, how it offends the conscience of each of us and compels all institutions to make convincing efforts towards the necessary end of this state of affairs."
"As far as the data on accidents at work are concerned, they seem to show some positive turnaround, but this does not deny that the number of deaths due to work-related injuries is alarming anyway," noted Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmilu.
"We wouldn't want this 'reduction effort' to lead to less attention, because just when the attention stops, tragedy breaks out.
"We believe that in general, too little is being done to stop the problem of injuries and there are many activities that can have an impact on the problem.
It is necessary, in our opinion, "Mercandelli stressed", "to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the training of workers, starting from school age."
"Further efforts are needed," he added, "in terms of communication and the participation of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents an exceptional social phenomenon is needed."
Mercandelli ultimately declared that it was a progressive degeneration of the levels of right to compensation assumed for work victims and the "postponement of supportive care" that the system has been getting in recent years.
"The aim, then, is to return the insurance guarantee to the worker," he added, "because the fate of those who hurt themselves must not depend on spontaneity or gifts from time to time by the legislator."
Mp3 players accused, putting hearing at risk
Listening to loud music for extended periods of time and using portable music devices as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to a notice published today by the European Commission, which in an official report circulated in Brussels quotes the opinion of the Science Committee on health risks that have recently arisen and been identified (Csrseri) by the EU.
"This scientific opinion – we read in the notes – suggests that 5-10% of those who listen to music with portable music devices for at least five years, more than an hour a day per week, and keep the device at a high volume, risk permanent loss of hearing ability."
"It worries me that such a large number of young people, who often use portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels, may unknowingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way," admits Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings – the leader continues – there is a clear risk and a need for a rapid response.
The most important thing is that we need to encourage consumers to make this information public.
We must continue to re-examine the control systems already in place in the light of this scientific finding so that they become fully effective and keep pace with new technology".
Brussels has asked an independent scientific committee to investigate the problem, given the high use of portable music devices and the increasing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
"Scientists – the EU executive concludes – confirm that there is a need to be concerned and now the European Commission will examine together with the other members and stakeholders that raised the problem what measures could possibly be put in place to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise caused by portable musical devices and similar devices."
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, but there is growing concern about hearing damage that can be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to greatly limit this damage by looking for solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
In its conviction, the EUSC states that users of portable music equipment, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours per week, will exceed the currently valid limits corresponding to the maximum permissible noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for an extended period of time risk permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such devices, and their number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno to let the Commission for the Future of the Capital run its course
Today we will start, in March we will close, in June we will have sums.
Such is the calendar given by Campidoglio to the staff of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome" that met this morning at its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the commission will draw up handbooks for Rome.
When the doors close in March, Giunta and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidoglio and his councillor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is completely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are included there – Alemanno wants to emphasize – It will have to secure proposals for the development of Rome, which will ultimately be used by the political arbitrators, who remain the Giunta e Municipal Council.
It's not about an exchange of functions, but just an effort to have a place to work on a big project for Rome.
In March, the work will be completed, and then it will dissolve, since this institution must have an exact time deadline.
In June, the mayor announces, we will present a strategic plan and use the work done by the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome."
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of their proposals.
If they are good, as the Attali Commission's proposals are, and I am sure of this in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics spills over everyday problems and emergencies from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously for the development of Rome and its future.
Moreover, the Mayor of Rome wants to stress that "this Commission is neither a useless undertaking nor a bluff: it is completely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a single euro, and it will serve to reflect and engage the best intelligence that the capital has".
For Alemann, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic outline as a starting point, neither definitive nor immovable, in order to allow our city an authentic rise at the level it urgently needs, and to think with a united spirit about its future."
A future that, the mayor of Rome explains, "will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further" not only in terms of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as the capital, but "will also include the role that Rome can and must perform as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama? The first anti-American president. We already know why
One well-known US president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the U.S. economy with his decisions and maintained relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam."
Attacks against Obama are increasing just as the election date is approaching.
One lady from Miami wrote on the website: "This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has the audacity: he thinks he's going to get the highest post in a nation that had two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these attacks don't say much"; These are attacks of unambiguously racial origin and do not answer the voters' question: Will he make a good president? And then we have the polls; everyone says Obama will win, and by a wide margin.
Again, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
One newspaper in Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote the comment: at least once in the polling booth, we know very well who the American patriot will vote for.
One side of the American mentality that remained stilted until the last moment comes to light.
Say what you will, we'll take care of it ourselves, who to tick, Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain the success of a black candidate.
But for all these considerations, the Democrats' main weapon is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his mandate? Eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost fifty thousand soldiers and was sent home with kicks in the ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq has become a weakness for most of Bush.
Whoever takes the place of Georgia W will have a huge task to do.
The economic collapse of the US has also been felt by journalists: there is a period of austerity in the newspapers. And many blame the Internet, the "killer" of printed matter.
The PEW Research Center asked five hundred journalists about the state of their profession and their assumptions about the future.
Well, today almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, respondents did not openly say they had less to worry about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis of a shattered economic model.
Besides, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put together a newspaper, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists interviewed, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism as understood by the general public to fundamentally change.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist.
Six out of ten print journalists and executive seniors believe that journalism is on the wrong path on a national scale.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
Larger publishers are making their way to the Internet, which many see as a "killer" of printed matter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists point out has increased by as much as 79%.
Five hundred journalists surveyed admitted to resorting to technology in the hope that it would "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism is between those who run newsrooms – that is, managers – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of leaders at the national level are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the value drops to 23%.
This has to do with "job security" for some.
Leaders who think they will lose their jobs within three years are at the national level at 47%.
As for journalists, they are at 30%.
As for "secure work" regarding personnel (our editors, GDR) in America is still the order of the day.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In a nation as vast as the US, with a population of three hundred million and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, so it's a matter of taking it or leaving it.
Managers almost always receive huge salaries, and an editor can earn ten thousand dollars a month in addition to paying for his pension and insurance.
As for holidays, the argument becomes more complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year, until fifteen days after a certain number of years are reached.
But American journalists, by their own admission, often fall ill within a year.
It is only a question of climate.
UNIPOL: ROME COURT, DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Rome Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject a submission by real estate entrepreneur Daniel Coppola, who asked to be allowed to relocate from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in connection with a counteroffer in the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at his own expense last week, he was released from house arrest, which was converted into a forced permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the real estate entrepreneur be allowed to change his place of residence from a rural town to a capital city.
However, according to the court, this move (which the PM opposed) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in danger
This phenomenon became evident a few days ago, when the House of Representatives voted against the White House's $700 billion rescue plan: a significant portion of Americans were more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis is dividing the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, milder, welcoming to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which is conservative, hostile to "those in Washington" and to the world of finance, strong especially in the states of the central and south.
A soul that arrogantly showed itself in the vote I spoke of at the beginning.
But this thing just quoted is only an example of the changes, the great changes that the current economic earthquake is already showing: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not only here.
In both the US and Europe, this crisis seems to be acting as an accelerator of phenomena that have been in incubation for a long time, that are consolidating in the new climate and are finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the reactualization, the extraordinary revival of the market, the double category of State-Power in relation to a certain renationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking and financial institutions, which, of course, have strong ties abroad, but in which, above all, the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one state, are included to the greatest extent.
Which has created a political problem for those who run it at the same time: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are, among others, voters.
In short, the crisis appears to be economically world, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationality seems to be largely out of the question, or that it has little to add: the obvious proof is provided by the European Union, which is divided, as always, between different interests and different state strategies, and which is unable to decide on one common political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each individual state, rescue plans, market recovery, new rules and, above all, the distribution of funds: at the moment when we are in distress, only the states have the economic means, the amount of financial resources, to be able to try to put everything in order.
And they possess the necessary means and justifications to use them: two sources of immense value, under certain circumstances, which perhaps no market and no international organization will ever be able to possess to such an extent.
This new emphase, which the crisis places on the state-national element, is, moreover, entirely in line with the increasing importance that recent economic advances are trying to attach to a factor closely linked to it: territorial jurisdiction.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of the network, an increasingly sophisticated technology, immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to rule the world, we suddenly realized that our future would have to contend more and more with such intangible things as water, grain, oil.
All things, who would have said so, may be transported from one place on earth to another, but they are in any case connected, absolutely, to a limited space, a territory.
So, who becomes their ruler, certainly has many more cards up his sleeve than who is not, and who has the misfortune to live in a place without grain, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty, which, however, foresees a turning point.
Whoever speaks of territory, state, government, inevitably speaks of politics, that is, of leadership.
Taking into account the economic crisis, it seems that two convergent phenomena are forming.
On the one hand, the realization that there is an objective need for authoritarian leadership, a request for someone who could take up the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discrediting against existing leadership, especially economic ones, which turned out to be equally unsatisfactory and full of dark places.
And together they have something even deeper and, in a sense, disturbing: discreditedness, impatience, a sense of incompetence and absence, which is trying to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
It seems that there is a growing conviction among the broad masses of the population that their actions should be the same as the ideas of the hitherto popular elite, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite has outdone its time and is indifferent to the opinions of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership feeds a branch from the underground, but a strong movement to eliminate the ruling classes and the traditional political order manifests itself in sudden electoral "resistances" or unexpected changes in collective sentiment in recent and recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the fall of Labour in the United Kingdom, to the revolt of US congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy).
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligentsia, some would say their format, have more and more problems to understand, that is, to represent, which, not from today, is forming in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is once again strengthening, growing, potentially over-wracking.
Before this, it would be an exaggeration to speak of a permanent "mass revolt".
But we certainly can't say that it means keeping your eyes really open.
Super glue for walking on walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centers, and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
Scientists managed to keep a hundred-kilogram body glued to a vertical wall using a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing materials that use a special carbon structure called carbon dwarf tubes.
"The glue base can be thought of as a series of tubes laid like an arranged pile of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the gecko's legs, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to provide perfect adhesion.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the reptiles' feet and at the same time "simply detaches from the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton University's School of Engineering.
WALK ON WALLS? "This material could be useful as a makeshift glue," adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk on walls like Spiderman? Perhaps, but researchers think of far less fascinating uses as a combination of electrical devices, because dwarf carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering .
No super heroes yet.
OTHER RESEARCH – The University of California, Berkeley, is also researching a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal of the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists presented glue formed from microfibers as hair that cleans itself of dust by moving it across the surface to still maintain perfect fitness.
Medications: never with juices
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed primarily in summer because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving drugs, their ingestion changes the intensification or decrease in effectiveness with serious health consequences.
To highlight the risks of juices, both ready-to-eat and fresh, combined with the ingestion of certain medications, David Bailey is raising a new alarm at the ongoing 263rd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: one glass of grapefruit, orange, and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some life-saving drugs, nullify their benefits, and put patients' health at risk.
Grapefruit juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to toxic levels the effects of certain anti-arithmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolitics, antihistamine and neurological drugs.
DRUGS AT RISK – The Italian Medical Agency itself announced this in a newsletter two years ago, urging doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers of this mixture and to be careful about what they drink when taking medications, such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that suppress drugs.
A long list of effects inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, Director of the Department of Pharmacology at the State University of Milan: "Such discoveries are usually immediately reported to various international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which eventually arrange and exchange drug information instructions.
So always read the illustrative tickets of the medicines you get, and if you come across something unclear, do not worry, but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification," the expert told Ansa.
Nobel for Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old New Kenyan who teaches at Priceton University and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of the Bush administration's foreign, economic and policy actions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days of the collapse of Enron, Krugman predicted in a New York Times op-ed that the second event would be far more important than the first in terms of its implications for U.S. history.
A prediction which aroused quite a few controversies and which had been reproached against him for years, but which proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and shocked at the speed with which collapses like Enron and Worldcom disappeared from public attention," Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Central European Bank's executive committee, Krugman is "an economist of great importance," but also a popularizer who has "a very aggressive style, especially critical of the excesses of the Bush liberal administration."
Open Office, we have here the third edition of the package"anti-Microsoft»
It is the day of the release of Open Office.org 3.0, an open source personal production package that aims to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the better-known Microsoft Office.
After about a year of work by volunteers controlled by the SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is presented to the general public with various innovations: the welcome screen and the revised and improved opening window will be joined by other, much more important, such as compatibility for Apple's Mac OS X operating system and support for the new Open Document Format (ODF) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Emphasis is also placed on cooperation with the Office 2007 package, Open Office is able to open a document with a new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models, such as what allows to reduce the dimensions of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transfer, or the ability to transfer a PDF folder to a graphic design model and preserve the original appearance of the page.
From this point of view, we can still create "PDF hybrid" documents that resemble typical Adobe graphics and have the characteristics of a spreadsheet or word processing program.
Collaboration is an element that has received many improvements within application programs: in Excel it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in a text program each collaborator is assigned one color for comments to make identification clearer in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working on porting some of Open Office's features to the Web (on the cloud), and should present a definitive result in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, it has been added to the English version, which can be found on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
Also, the installation CD can be sent to your home or workplace on request.
And if the topic of free care can be a draw for expansion in households, the Open Office package is betting a lot on the business area, and it can already count on various projects implemented in public administration and schools.
And there are also offers of training, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video typing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet program that is moving towards replacing Excel; Impress for Powerpoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, after all, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are at almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is possible that this expected number may even be exceeded.
Kohl's results are also positive, this is the fourth case of doping
A new positive case at the last Tour de France: Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, third classified and winner of the best climber's shirt.
The report was quoted by the website of L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth rider positive for Cera, a third-generation Epo, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, as well as himself from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl's blood samples fall into those conducted in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If control analyses confirm the positive on Cera, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and will have to face the stipulated two years of disqualification.
The report of Kohl's positivity at the third-generation Epo is confirmed by the head of France's anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had already reported the outcome to Austrian government authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian finished on the podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sastro and American Cadel Evansema, and also won the polka dot shirt of the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES ASKS, IS ITALY A RACIST?
Italy, "as a country of emigrants only in the last house turned into a priority destination for immigrants" received with disgust.
Does it turn a beautiful country into a nation of racists? So asks in a long article in the New York Times, which devoted this article to the debate on racism in Italy, and began with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan because he stole a box of cookies.
The case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "Northern paradox": the northern regions are also those where "more integration and more work" are registered, but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the strongest support for the Northern League."
To confirm rising tensions between Italians and immigrants, the NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
The new legislation demanded by Lega, which seeks to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of Italy's changing climate.
A tendency emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedetto XVI in the Quirinale, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism."
The plane of Steve Fossett, the millionaire who disappeared a year ago, is found
The remains of Steve Fossett's plane, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying over the Nevada desert, were found.
The wreckage was discovered on a plateau at an altitude of three thousand meters, in the area of Mammoth Lakes in the Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the aircraft.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson dispelled doubts that remained: "The plane has been found, we have sent a team there, and now we are certain that this is exactly the one Steve Fossett was flying in the day he disappeared," he said at a news conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been presumed dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (NTSB) reported that hours after the wreckage was detected, an investigation team was dispatched to identify the plane: it was Bellanca 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada, for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal belongings were found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and one jacket.
The search for Fossett was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire earned his place in history thanks to a long collection of firsts.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a trip around the world in an air balloon: two weeks of flight alone.
Three years later, he flew around the world in an airplane and without landing.
Among his many records is also a flight at an altitude of 15,445 meters, over the Andes, albeit with a co-pilot.
Glk, advertising you don't expect
One unusual SUV with an original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This, in short, is the last born Glk of the "compact" jeeps of the star's house, with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to bring a whirlwind of novelties to this sector.
Thanks to its unconventional design, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Glk SUV will also be unexpected and unconventional, which will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next 17 October.
In this way, the advertising campaign that will accompany the debut of the new vehicle will also launch an unofficial way of communication thanks to the futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which is thus used for the first time in Italy for a car brand.
The maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will dominate Milan's main shopping street, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and with the help of special glasses, which will be distributed near the Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, if you look at the picture, you will have the impression that the car will roll out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different moments in all its little things, only to then reassemble into a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical area of automotive communication with this advertisement.
Will he succeed in attracting the interest of future customers in this way? We'll see.
So we already know who the Italian hooligans are
From Triveneto, they risk Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group, which has been following the Nazionale azzurra for years and which, to be honest, has never caused excessive problems.
Nor did she ever meet fans of the opposing team.
The orientation of the group is right-wing.
The founders come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, they were joined by small groups (actually few groups) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tri-colored flags on which the cities of origin of the participants appear: they removed them on Saturday night so that they would not be recognized.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they found true Nazi fans, Levski.
Figc made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all named, thus easily controlled.
And Viminale did check them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with Dashl in progress, no one who would be forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans who had previous violations from the stadium were denied tickets and banned from the match.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports that will come from the Bulgarian police, then he will take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for five years at least to fans who were arrested or those who were identified during the riots.
International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer set foot in a single stadium.
On luck.
But now there is a fear of emulation: that is, to those more than one hundred and fifty, others will be added.
"We must immediately put out this fire and not justify those who behave in this way," they confirm from Viminal.
So, "really open eyes, mainly because of the national match on Wednesday in Leč".
It is in Puglia that there is a small core of supporters.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio will meet, on Tuesday Casms, who can count on one part of Aise, it is the secret service that takes care of the problems in the stadiums.
"A chorus of Leader-Leaders and an outstretched arm during Mameli's anthem? It is not a crime in Bulgaria...".
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in a really unfortunate way), who has been the director of the Viminal Osservatorium for a few weeks (he got a job that was previously Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly bursar in Trieste, home to the core of the supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that it is not a crime in Bulgaria to glorify a leader, but of course the behaviour of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
"I'm not a sociologist," the Osservatorian one adds, "crimes are attributed to the country in which they took place.
So far, this group has remained within limits, now we will take a good look at what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about whistling during Mameli's anthem: it's not a crime either, but if you'll allow me, it's bad manners..."
Students victims of expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students knows no crisis.
According to the latest research by Sunia, a tenants' union, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has already reached such proportions that entire layers of students have lost the right to study because of the overall too high prices that their families would have to endure – explains the head of the Sunia studios office, Laura Mariani – in this city the high demand from students has distorted the market in such a way that it has stimulated a process of price increases that has spread to residents."
In most cases, rental offers contain several offences: loose contracts, unregistered, no limited leases, associated subleases.
For Sunji, an exceptional intervention is needed that could regulate prices through a tax overhaul.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, about 450 euros are needed for one bed, for a single room you pay from a minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere zone) through a medium value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to a maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in zones close to the university, 250/280 euros are needed for a bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single room.
In Rome in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros for a single room, 450 beds in a double.
Prices are slightly lower (€550 per single) in zones close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We only save if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room zones Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples you need 300/450 euros for a bed, for a room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the zones Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari they want 250/350 euros for a bed, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller towns, prices are definitely lower, but they have a greater impact on citizens' economies.
In cities like Perugia, where rents for students from outside the European Union are the most common phenomenon, another anomaly is finally being noticed: an increase of roughly 25-30% of the fee they want from foreign students, compared to Italian ones.
Farewell to the old Paradiso cinema, the city cancels the historical halls
Cinematographic historical halls are closing in favor of Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas is like a blind one, it's like a face without eyes."
The painting offered by director Giuseppe Tornator successfully documents what is happening in the great Italian urban centers, but also in rural towns.
The process of cinema restrictions, the birth of large multi-screens in the suburbs and the subsequent disappearance of mono-screens in the central zones of cities, is one of the events that seems inevitable and irreversible, but it also has all the hallmarks of a real cultural crime.
Often historical places full of memories disappear, "it's like losing a friend, an acquaintance with whom we shared a part of the journey and a lot of emotions", feels the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that won an Oscar and the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes twenty years ago, and which told the poetry of a village cinema and the sadness of a way of life that cinema has probably lost forever.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years, 316 traditional tip cinemas have closed their doors, and the highest bill has been paid mainly by the halls in the most important cities: 10 fewer in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 fewer in Torín, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures, Emilia-Romagna ranks first with a loss of 82 cinema halls, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the advent of the multiplex is the first responsible for their disappearance are the three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new cinema multiples: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 more in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian approach has developed irrationally," argues Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the existing ones will survive, because when one cinema in a city closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to a multiplex.
Then let us not even talk about the insufficient subsidy for the fund in favour of the operators: the previous state debt is roughly EUR 10 million.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
Between €16 million and €18 million a year would be needed to support the sector."
Interesting is the Bologna case, the first Italian city to worry about road closures and which decided to find a way out by signing a protoculum between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in the historic centers and in the suburbs.
Among the planned norms are tax relief steps in favour of operators and benefits for the audience in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter a zone with limited traffic and will have special prices to stop and in some parking lots.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example by introducing other measures."
However, it is certain that in order to stand up against the great power of the multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and picture, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a topic that has always been important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to found the "New Paradiso Cinema", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk in front of the already closed Rialto or Quirinal in the street Nazionale, where I shared so much emotion that I did not have to look at the inscriptions blackened by dust, I turn to the other side».
Connection between politics and mafia group 'ndrangheta, mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adjust the municipal elections according to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group."
The accusations that the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria is making against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno, Carlo Martelli, imprisoned this morning for external collaboration with a mafia organisation, are heavy.
Also in handcuffs are Gioacchino Piromalli, an old intermediary between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, the boss's namesake, already accused of committing mafia crimes, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"They ignored all legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," prosecutors wrote, as two local governments expressed their willingness to pay for consultations with attorney Piromalli.
"In this way, they would allow the mafia group, the judges write, to officially enter city offices and facilitate the already enormous possibilities of control and management of public administration."
Agazio Loiero, president of the Calabrian Regional Commission, makes no secret of the fact that "there are many collusions between local institutions and the organized criminal underworld in his region: "There are areas in which the mafia's concentration is stronger than in others, where collusion is inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who are still immaculate."
This morning's arrests follow arrests in July last year, by which police showed that the Piromalli mafia group had been given a final hit.
Since the end of April last year - the Gioii Tauro city council has been dissolved since 1991, the reason for the then supposed connection between organized crime and local government - local politicians have been deprived of their positions in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, leader of the Christian Democrats who at the moment of dissolution was elected head of a centre-right coalition following a narrower election in May.
He screamed about the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called then Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minniti to account, accusing him of plotting it all for political reasons, but the judges explain in the detention order signed this morning that the mafia group had even gone so far as to ask for a change to the A3 motorway project.
Further interrogations ordered against Dal Torrion, prosecutors write, revealed "a willingness to transfer the claims of a businessman, a representative of a larger group very close to Piromalli, and to adapt the public administration choices to the interests of the mafia group."
When energy is born from waves, the big ones come into play.
It is an endless deposit that covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface and is now being discovered by the world's major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, tides are new sources of inexhaustible energy on which the eyes of behemoths like Chevron have been glued, which is now trying to lay hands on these resources.
The possibility of generating energy from sea movements has been studied for more than a century, and in the 70s, in connection with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of using marine energy fell by the wayside. But now environmental organizations and a new increase in the price of oil have given a new impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London said in 2007 that approximately 15 percent of the world's electricity consumption could be met by the movement of the waves of the seas.
That amount would be twice the energy currently produced at nuclear centers.
In addition, there are currents and tides.
Giants attack.
the company that bet on marine energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it looked like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, there are more and more companies that are betting on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology," a spokesman for a company linked to the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal — and they're thinking about working with us."
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining permission from the US Energy Commission, which is required to start a marine energy project in Alaska.
This signal cannot be underestimated, especially when we consider that it is in Alaska that the US continues to produce oil, and recently President Bush came up with a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, New York's Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey's Ocean Power are following the trail of marine energy, and the sums invested so far, while not known in detail, show growing interest, according to observers.
Technologies that need to be developed.
Experts talk about a technology that is still in its infancy, because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
For now, the facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small in size and do not seem to cause major problems for the ecosystem.
However, for greater energy production, it is necessary to use technologies with a greater impact on the environment.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of fears that are interconnected with each other.
The force of the waves that move the buoys up and down is changed by means of cylinders and cylinders to the hydraulic pressure inside these buoys.
The pressure spins the turbine, which supplies power to the generator.
Energy reaches shore via submarine cables.
For now, four facilities of this type are in the project phase, awaiting federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for military purposes.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, is already generating power for the mall and parking lot using six pdsea turbines in New York's East River.
The movement of water during high tide causes the turbines to rotate, which feed the generator with this rotational motion.
Verdant said they have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorizations to harness the energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the tides.
The tidal potential deserves particular interest at this point, they say at the Institute for Electricity Research.
Although it is a discontinuous factor, tides are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
New York, Maine, and Alaska, along with other coastal states, have already invested $7 and a half million dollars in tidal energy in 2008 and predicted investments of up to $35 million in 2009.
