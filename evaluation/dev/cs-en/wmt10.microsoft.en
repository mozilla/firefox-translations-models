Barack Obama wins Nobel Peace Prize as fourth US president
US President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US president in history.
He will receive a diploma, medal and check for $1.4 million, among other things, for his exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The head of the White House will arrive in the Norwegian capital in the morning with his wife Michelle and will be busy.
First, he will visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with five members of the committee that selected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple are then scheduled to meet with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony at which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will win it as the fourth US president, but only the third to receive the award in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghan war when accepting the award.
The president does not want to avoid this topic, because he realizes that he is accepting the award as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
He stepped up the war effort a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, something none of his critics will fail to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check for ten million Swedish kroner (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate them to charity, but has not yet decided on a specific charity.
The busy schedule will then take the president and his wife to a banquet where, in addition to the Norwegian king and queen, the prime minister and 250 other invited guests will be present.
From the beginning, Obama was rather reticent about the price.
He said, for example, that he felt he did not fully deserve it.
He also reiterated several times that it is not just a prize for him, but for all those who strive for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said it was a "call to action" for him.
Conservationist accused of extortion
The Litoměřice Police accused the chairman of the civic association Society for Nature Conservation Litoměřice of blackmail.
In several cases in the past year, he appealed to some building permit proceedings and demanded money from investors for his own benefit to withdraw the appeal, Litoměřice police spokeswoman Alena Romová said.
The chairman of the Society for Nature Conservation in Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is now in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
Sorting containers do not smell much in Brno
In Prague, ordinary people can sort beverage packaging, in South Moravian villages you can meet sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
There you should set aside a few minutes until you find suitable bins.
I do not want to say that waste is not sorted at all in Brno.
But it seems to me that despite the fact that we are the second largest city in the country, the councilors are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the forest league of waste sorting not only because as citizens we can still throw only paper, glass and plastics into the sorting containers, but above all by the number of bins for such waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a PET bottle into a collection bin in the center?
It's a finished art, it mainly takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have come across so far is on Moravian Square opposite Potrefená Hus.
Let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues not be angry with me, but it seems to me a hell of a lot.
Not to mention that in other parts too, sorting waste is no honey.
Many of my friends prefer not to sort the waste.
Out of laziness.
It's far from garbage cans.
I am not surprised by them.
I offered myself after the celebration to throw away a few glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colored garbage cans on Kounicova Street in sight.
Fortunately, I found the right place on the way to the tram.
However, garbage was overflowing from it.
After all, it is still the center of Brno, which perhaps represents the city the most, right?!
But ecology and some aesthetics probably do not interest the Brno socialists very much.
They would rather buy the city an ice hockey league, which will bring shame to us throughout the country, than buy a few extra containers and offer to sort other raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I could confirm my assumption after a while of browsing the Internet with official statistics.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravian Region.
"Paroubek's" budget took money for pensions and sick leave
After the left has added farmers or officials, contrary to the government's opinion, there may not be money in the budget for pensions, sickness or building savings.
But also on interest on the national debt or on international litigation.
It will cause problems for those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists pushed for increases for some groups, they relied on the government to borrow additional money for sensitive expenses, pensions, or sick pay. "It's just postponing problems to the future, laying mines," Janota says.
The borrowed money is paid more and more interest and must sometimes be returned.
The state does not have much choice where to take it.
If they do not reduce social benefits or the cost of running the state, they must raise taxes.
To all those now added by the left: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later to their children.
People do not have to worry about pensions or sick leave, from whose account 1.8 billion disappeared, they will get them.
However, at the cost of the state becoming more indebted – next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the coffers, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will grow faster and faster, and with it the cost of interest.
The state will need money to pay for it, and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity leave, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Due to shifts of money to several groups of voters, there will also be a shortfall of five billion next year for the completion of highways and railways.
These are mostly already tendered and unfinished sections that cannot be redesigned and possibly cheapened.
At most, to mothball, which is also not free.
This means delaying or stopping thirty large constructions, and drawing European money is also at risk, warns Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD proposed that it would solve the loss of money in a Solomonic way – it would reach into ČEZ's dividends, which the state mostly owns, and from them it would pour in the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, and it is certainly not a bottomless resource.
Last year, CZK 18 billion came from ČEZ to the budget.
Every year, dividends are used to pay for the settlement of environmental damage, replenish the pension account or serve as a reserve for the upcoming pension reform.
Moreover, according to EU rules, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP.
But the carnival of transfers does not end there.
Almost three billion was lost in the budget for various compensation to victims of communism and crimes, or for expenses for litigation, even for building savings.
Whether the state can do without this money is not certain.
This is a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we will have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save money inside the ministry or, in the worst case, tap the government's budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing for the already launched two-billion project State Treasury, which should allow online monitoring of what individual offices spend on.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions will come, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
In the future, Americans are counting on a mobile phone on which the user will switch between different operating systems at the touch of a single button.
The unveiled plans sound promising.
Just press one key and you can transfer from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
This is exactly the possibility of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We allow you to keep two user profiles on your mobile at the same time.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
The two will be working at the same time, VMware's Srinivas Krishnamurti hinted in an interview with Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and was presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Smartphone virtualization is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM, which also ran Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and U.S. carriers to test smartphone virtualization, and the devices are expected to reach customers in 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains troubles hoteliers
The bare slopes are not only a concern for the Krkonoše ski lifters.
The lack of snow also discourages people from booking ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That is why you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of traffic on our site.
People browse through offers, find out prices, but so far they are afraid to make binding orders.
And if they call us, they immediately ask whether we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or mud," said Martin Jandura, the operator of the Spindl.Info information portal.
Those who want a New Year's Eve stay in Špindlerův Mlýn exactly according to their wishes should not hesitate to order.
Those who prefer to save money and the quality of accommodation is second to them can still try to wait a few days.
Špindlerův Mlýn hoteliers currently offer mostly week-long stays on New Year's Eve.
I think they will try to denounce them for a while, but then they will also relent, and they will go for a shorter period of time.
And then the free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter terms are still offered by the Vrchlabi travel agency Ingtours.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not sold out yet.
Even so, half of the places in our offer remain vacant.
That's why we've already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas stays," said Petr Schiefert, director of Ingtours.
New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains can still offer Vrchlabi travel agency, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days in February are also selling well, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is negatively affected by the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to see if he attacks.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy during the week, Christmas will sell out," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, the rooms of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou are being occupied a little better than last year.
We are about five percent better off.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last few places.
There is great interest in Polish holidays in January and February is also selling well," said Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
Eighty percent of New Year's Eve stays are occupied by the Omnia Hotel at the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free in the newest hotel in Janské Lázně at Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised by January this year, which is already about sixty percent occupied at this moment.
February is still a little weaker, but as soon as the snow falls, the interest in stays in the Giant Mountains will certainly increase, said the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
However, the Krkonoše hoteliers still have to get a taste for more snow.
Thursday should cool down, if there will be any precipitation, so the mountains should be snow.
But then the warming should come again, informed Jiří Jakubský from the Hradec office of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost comical with what schoolboy diligence Barack Obama, a president with a reputation for being the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor, whom he considered the most stupid, on the Afghan issue.
When he finally sweated out his long-awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had copied it from Bush's Iraq script three years ago.
Not only does he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, but he did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's January 2007 statement as the title of his own declaration: "A New Way Forward."
Three years ago, he criticized Bush's idea of sending fresh troop reinforcements to civil war Iraq as an "irresponsible and disastrous decision."
But the months that followed showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field commanders, was the only possible and highly successful strategy to the point that Iraq is now not mentioned in news reports.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, but objectively he left his successor with a much more grateful starting point than might have been expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
He was again asked to increase the military contingent by field commanders, notably the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even harshly criticized the reluctant gunmen in the White House, despite subordination customs.
He asked for 40,000 men to turn the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he couldn't think of anything better, so at least he cheated the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to squeeze another 5,000 out of Europe, even though he had originally counted on at least 10.
The most problematic part of Obama's entire strategy seems to be his intention to begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in as little as 18 months and complete the process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than it answers.
Many doubt that a half-scale increase will bear the same fruit as the Iraq move.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well ordered, with its leaders honoring agreements.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the opposite symptom - no one can be relied upon and no agreements are being honoured.
Under these conditions, the Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing masters every day as they see fit, are poorly prepared.
Political institutions, even if formally established, will remain a Potemkin village beyond which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to flourish.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily difficult, given the lack of clarity that makes Pakistani and Iranian influences even more difficult.
Even the construction of an "operational state", which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, does not seem very realistic.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy is striking in its voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the verge of exploding.
To believe that soldiers sent into the turmoil of war for the purpose of "returning home soon" will cause the miracle done here can only be truly romantic, untouched by reality.
Politically, setting a date for troop withdrawal is sheer irresponsibility, as the Taliban will see it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans' willingness to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is approaching the negative.
European politicians do not know how and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically intervening in the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, the United States will face the difficult question of whether to try to solve the problem by military force.
An answer will be needed just as Obama believes America is moving toward a victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
But any such solution will also mark a dramatic turn in the Afghan situation.
The only band-aid for Barack Obama is that with three years to go before the presidential election, there is still plenty of time left for him to come up with another strategy if it proves to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs executives no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior executives at the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The announcement was made by the company, which is responding to sharp criticism of its wage practices.
Instead of money, a group of 30 top executives will receive shares that can be sold in five years at the earliest.
In addition, shares can be taken away from managers if they take excessive risks.
Goldman Sachs is taking the lead in linking Wall Street rewards to long-term performance.
"I think Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to take," said Douglas Elliott, a former JPMorgan investment banker.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has come under fire after setting aside almost $17 billion (almost CZK 300 billion) in bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The company's total compensation for this year is likely to exceed $20 billion, despite the measure announced today.
High bonuses in the banking sector have become a hot political issue in many countries with the onset of the financial crisis.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intends to impose a one-off tax on bankers' bonuses in excess of £25,000 (roughly CZK 712,000).
France is preparing similar steps.
This year, women won Nobel Prizes in all disciplines except physics
A record five women received this year's Nobel Prize in the professional categories and literature from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden in Stockholm today.
In addition to the four female scientists, the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak for their research on chromosomes.
The Chemistry Prize went to Israeli Ada Jonath along with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for elucidating the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last laureate was the Nobel Prize in Economics, which went to the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for their analyses of economic governance.
The only professional category that went without a holder this year was physics.
The prize went to Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each winner received a diploma, a Nobel medal and a certificate of financial reward.
For each category, it amounts to ten million Swedish kronor (approximately CZK 25 million).
If there are more winners in each of them, they share the reward among themselves.
U.S. President Barack Obama received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo, Norway.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his award, as he is only at the beginning of his career and leads a country that is fighting two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But in defending his policy, he added that wars are necessary to win peace in certain situations, even if the cost is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the Castle
On Friday morning, President Vaclav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who is considering remaining in the government because he disagrees with the form of the state budget for next year as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
The budget and possibly Janot's stay in the cabinet are expected to be the topics of their Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, it has too high a deficit, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The meeting was informed by the president's spokesman Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to discuss her continued tenure with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget law, which Klaus will now get to sign, the Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
But on Wednesday, the House approved proposals from the left to move money and increase money for the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government reproached the Social Democrats' proposals for covertly increasing the budget deficit.
Because of this, a sharp internal political dispute has arisen between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, due to which a question mark is beginning to hover over the further operation of Fischer's caretaker cabinet, which was agreed to form in the spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics say the budget as adopted by the House effectively destroys the package of austerity measures that Fischer's government pushed through in the autumn, which it says is intended to stop the state's debt.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the law on the state budget, said at today's discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians have long neglected a "serious problem", which is the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
Today, according to him, he no longer has a good solution.
Improvements could only be brought by a strong government that could rely on a broader consensus of political parties, he said.
ODS chairman Mirek Topolánek said the budget was terrifying and the government should consider continuing to exist.
ODS Vice-Chairman Petr Nečas told the Czech News Agency that the concept of a caretaker cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "strong statements".
ČSSD chief Jiří Paroubek responded to Topolánek by saying that the budget deficit prepared by the former Topolánek government for this year, which will exceed 200 billion crowns, is frightening.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD called the approval of the state budget for next year a success.
The Christian Democrats were also satisfied.
Mandela is played by Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's novelty
South Africans say the new Hollywood film Invictus: Undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, its struggle and victories, despite some criticism that American actors play the lead roles.
The story is about sports, race and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his life story by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said ninety-one-year-old Mandela asked him if he could play him in Eastwood's film.
Another notable role in it is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, 'If I'm going to play you, I'm going to have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who won an award for his role in Eastwood's boxing drama A Million Dollar Baby, has played the leader of the slave-turned-slave movement, the fictional president of the United States, and even the god in Divine Evan, but rarely someone who is still alive and as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was sentenced to 27 years in prison for his active work to end apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is the Latin word for undefeated and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him
The film is the true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. President-elect Mandela knows that his nation remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite rugby players, who are among the underdogs worldwide.
The South African team eventually qualified for the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela's story to the screen.
"I had no other goal than to play this role in a way that brought it as close to reality as possible," Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, dine with him, be backstage before his speech.
Most importantly, he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
"I found that when I squeezed your hand, I took your energy, it was transmitted, and I felt like I knew how you felt," he said.
It's important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays François Pienaar, the captain of the white national rugby team.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
The big surprise for him was when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember ringing the doorbell, he opened it for me and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in a movie'.
Despite the distinct differences in the characters' characters compared to their real-life counterparts under Eastwood's direction, Invictus: Undefeated received positive reviews and Oscar ambitions.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment in the words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In movie reviews on rottentomatoes.com websites, Invictus received 76 percent positive ratings.
The secret of the glow over Norway solved: The Russians tested a missile
A strange light effect of unknown origin could be observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry only admitted yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
The launch was again unsuccessful and the missile referred to as the "Bulava" type, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming a nightmare for Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in the tests of the rocket did not have a proper effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava usually did not take off at all or was damaged in the air.
Russian newspapers already refer to "Bulava" as "a rocket that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly but shines
This 13th attempt was initially normal.
Only at the end of the flight was the technical damage of the apparatus again.
Apparently, the engine in the third stage of the rocket exploded.
This time, "Bulava" took off from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which sailed under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows you to shoot from a vessel that is both in motion and submerged.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unspecified flying object was indeed a malfunctioning "Bulava".
After all, the Norwegians had no doubt from the first moment that it was a Russian missile.
This time, the generals defend themselves, arguing that it is impossible to speak unequivocally of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket lasted and the accident affected only the third.
In previous cases, the engines failed in the first stage.
Although not a single test launch took place flawlessly, only six out of thirteen are considered unsuccessful by the leadership of the Ministry of Defence.
Almost fifty percent success rate therefore fills the generals with optimism and so they still claim that the "Bulava" will one day fly without problems and that it can even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear units with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defenseman Vyacheslav Fetisov will once again play in a professional hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will help his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably play in Friday's KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov, who retired at the age of forty in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After the injury of Denis Kuljaš, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov trains regularly and has agreed to help the team.
We just need to sort out some formalities, Moscow coach Sergei Nemchinov was quoted as saying by The Associated Press.
It is not yet clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will involve only one match.
"I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirit of other players," Nemchinov said.
Fetisov will become Russia's oldest professional hockey player if he returns to the ice.
In the NHL, at the age of fifty-one, legendary forward Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
With the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic golds, seven world titles, and triumphed at the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championships.
In the second part of his career, he also gained success in the NHL, where he twice lifted the Stanley Cup in Detroit.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai complied with the unions. Cancels all overtime
The management of the Nošovice car manufacturer Hyundai has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was precisely because of the often ordered overtime that the unions declared a strike alert on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai spokesman Petr Vaněk.
However, the management wants to agree with the unions on one more Saturday shift this year.
We cannot give up on our production plan, which is essential, so voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, with two shifts done, Vanek said.
Server Sedmička.cz wrote that the company of employees who work Saturday shift offered a bonus of CZK 400.
People will get it retroactively for the working Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaněk, the company has decided to change the way employees are motivated for the proposed overtime.
They can either have their overtime pay paid or they can take compensatory time off on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays by a day, Vanek said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift will receive paid fare and lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and burning point in terms of comments and complaints from trade unionists, as well as protesting employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, the carmaker's employees were forced to work two hours of overtime practically every day after an eight-hour shift.
After signing the agreement, the unions will call off the strike alert
The next meeting between the carmaker's management and the unions is scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
The head of the union, Petr Kuchař, said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike alert.
The situation at the carmaker escalated last Wednesday, when about 400 employees went on spontaneous strike over constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay and alleged bullying.
Management countered that overtime must be done by employees to meet car delivery requirements.
In their strike alert announcement on Monday, the unions also demanded that no sanctions be imposed on workers who suspended production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, unions are asking the company to reduce overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay a reward of 5,000 crowns for it this year.
The Nošovice car manufacturer Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
The company started serial production last November.
By this September, it had produced about 80,000 cars, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works even on 'hardy' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow down the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it works even on viruses that have already acquired immunity against drugs.
In some cases, this outweighs the fact that the compound does not act as strongly on the common variant of the virus as some already available drugs.
AIDS cannot yet be cured.
However, patients can significantly prolong the life of a mixture of drugs that prevent the reproduction of HIV in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, the incomplete suppression of the reproduction of the virus results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the Institute of Chemical Technology Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metallocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the reproduction of the HIV virus.
Metallocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all drugs used today and therefore can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come up with new 'improved' compounds prepared based on the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to a viral protein.
Metallocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Treacherous and resilient virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV-protease-induced splitting of the HIV virus, mature infectious viral particles would not have formed.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, scientists explain in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is further systematically altered.
Slightly weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of agents against HIV protease was tested in a test tube and also against its resistant variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metallocarboranes on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as with clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect for resistant variants, against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical modifications make metallocarboranes interesting compounds for further research leading to the design of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Quarrel over the budget. ODS tackles Fischer, he defends himself
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek called the approved budget for next year "scary" and said Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should consider its continued existence.
The Prime Minister described the ODS statements as strong statements.
He said he was taking time to analyze.
ODS Deputy Chairman Petr Nečas said the concept of a caretaker cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party clearly no longer works.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on a minority in the Chamber of Deputies who want to fight the growing deficit or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed, Nečas pointed out.
On Wednesday, the Chamber of Deputies adopted the budget for 2010, but with left-wing amendments worth more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased money for the salaries of civil servants, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's criticism of the Social Democrats' proposals was that they were covertly increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, thus complying with the government's wish that even an amended budget is a less bad option than a provisional budget.
Disappointment and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government would assess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to leave office if the amendments were adopted, the situation might have looked different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment with the prime minister on Monday after the government.
He has indicated that he is considering continuing his tenure.
The reason for this is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
According to Nečas, if Fischer speaks out in favour of further combating the budget deficit, the nominees of the ČSSD, which pushed through the changes in the budget, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House passes other deficit-increasing bills, such as those relating to sickness benefits, pensions, or amendments to the Civil Service Act.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by ODS are not guilty
It is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did nothing wrong, Topolánek emphasized in a text message from the US.
He reminded that in several ministries there are people in deputy positions belonging to TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas emphasized that if Fischer decides to give up on the principle of fighting the public finance deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct that he relies on the left-wing majority that currently exists in the Chamber of Deputies."
But then he said he could not count on the support and tolerance of the Civic Democrats.
I haven't thought about it, and when it's up to date, I'll look into it," Defense Minister Martin Barták, who was nominated to the government by the Civic Democrats, told journalists in the Chamber of Deputies.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon for the European Council meeting.
At the Prime Minister's request, the ODS relented
Nečas also emphasized that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday if the Prime Minister did not explicitly ask the Civic Democrats to allow the budget to be adopted.
We don't feel like orphans, we're not small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS was burdened by the absence of the party chairman in parliament and the Czech Republic during the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't notice my voice missing.
Already when I was resigning my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about the Bolshevization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself responded.
According to the new ČD rules, fewer trains will run for almost the same fare
From 13 December, Czech Railways will cancel or reduce some less busy express trains and local trains, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent from the date of the new timetable compared to today.
Most tariffs, including basic and customer fares, will remain unchanged.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will get more options for connecting to the capital, the railways will add one Pendolino train to this line.
On the other hand, the high-speed train will stop running to Bratislava.
Fewer express trains will also operate on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, and direct connections Prague - Letohrad will be significantly reduced.
Of the regions, the railways are planning the largest reduction in traffic in the Hradec Králové Region, by a total of eight percent, while Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the route Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and the operation of several express trains on the route Prague - Písek - České Budějovice is limited to only some days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today Milovický have to change trains in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance connections to the capital will terminate at the destination station Prague Main Station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run at two-hour intervals.
From 13 December, passengers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava.
This year's regional rail bill: 200 million more
Fast trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, and it will give the railways four billion crowns next year to cover the so-called demonstrable loss, the same as this year. Locals are ordered by the regions, a total of eight billion crowns will be paid for them next year, with less than three billion regions contributing the state.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways have a newly signed ten-year contract for local and express trains, until now the contract has always been for one year.
The railways praise the system, which is why they probably did not increase the prices of the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will only be made to ČD Net one-day network tickets and cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from CZK 450 to CZK 600.
The price of eLiška will newly depend on the distance traveled, so far it has been uniform for travel between any regional capitals and amounted to CZK 160.
Filipino militants still detain over 50 people, children released
Gunmen kidnapped 75 people, including several elementary school pupils and their teachers, in the southern Philippines today.
This was reported by AFP, which initially reported only 65 abductees.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 militants are said to be using hostages as a human shield to escape from police.
Local negotiators are now trying to negotiate the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the Associated Press, police initially pursued the kidnappers because of the violence, which required settling scores between two local family clans.
In the southern Philippines in the province of Maguindanao, martial law has been declared due to the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the gubernatorial elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family, were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
South Africa's story concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
In the coming days, Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film Invictus (official title in Czech is Invictus: Undefeated), which captures part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter was taken by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself is said to have chosen for his portrayal years ago.
Matt Damon played the supporting male role of legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar.
With the film's release in cinemas, they emerge from critical and public responses
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
He received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 1988 and the Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk in 1993.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
high expectations, as they come as preparations for the World Cup in South Africa are at their peak, while the media is shaken by disturbing reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination against the population by the black ruling majority.
According to the Associated Press, the response to the new film in South Africa has been generally positive so far, despite numerous reservations about the casting of the main roles by "famous" Hollywood stars.
However, Morgan Freeman says he is proud of the new film.
I dreamed of this role for many years and prepared well for it.
I have also personally met Nelson Mandela many times to recharge his energy, as they say, he said in an interview after the film's gala premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can use the film to remind us of Mandela's personality and message.
It's South Africa's story, but it's about every person, he added.
In the jersey of the national rugby team
Based on the book by British writer John Carlin, loosely translated as The Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Gave Birth to the Nation, the film portrays a South African human rights activist during his first presidential term.
In the course of the film, Morgan Freeman tries to unite two racial and for many years mutually defined groups of the population, and just like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he enters the World Cup pitch in the South African national rugby jersey, which South Africa won at that time.
Fourteen years ago, Mandela received a great ovation from a predominantly white audience for entering the pitch in a jersey that is seen almost sacredly in South Africa, earning him the appreciation of the white population.
Perhaps the World Cup can bring people back together as one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve remains to be seen.
White South Africans, however, are sceptical, as rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country for Britain, revealed in a recent interview with LN.
The championship will begin on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns is burning in the Louny region
In the morning, the fire engulfed the Čeps transformer in the substation near the village of Výškov in the Louny region.
According to Lukáš Marvan, a spokesman for the Ústí Regional Firefighters, six units intervene in the fire.
Originally, the firefighters wanted to let the transformer burn out, but later they changed their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing agent.
The cause was a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured, and the accident does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system, according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandateová.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, it will be accurately quantified only after the end of the fire.
According to Mandateová, the destroyed transformer will need to be replaced with a new one.
In the ten years of Čeps's existence, nothing like this has happened, defects of this type are rare, she added.
According to ČEZ spokeswoman for northern Bohemia, Soňa Holingerová Hendrychová, the power supply was not interrupted, and the functioning of households, offices, and companies was not affected by the fire at the transformer station.
Čeps a.s. operates in the Czech Republic as the exclusive operator of the transmission system, 400 kV and 220 kV power lines.
It maintains, restores and develops 39 substations with 67 transformers transferring electricity from the transmission to the distribution system and a 4339 km long line route.
Jančura files a criminal complaint for defamation against three governors from the ČSSD
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jančura, will file a criminal complaint for defamation against three Social Democratic governors today.
Michal Hašek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínek from the Pardubice Region and the Governor of the Olomouc Region Martin Tesařík.
Jančura stated this in Twenty Minutes of Radiožurnál.
The lawsuit is related to the company's efforts to operate regional train services in some regions.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three governors attack us and talk about choosing raisins, but we brought an offer only for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the prices of Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It's for defamation against Student Agency, Jancura told Radiožurnál.
At the same time, he said he had evidence from all regions that they had not taken their actions in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Hašek considers the filing of the criminal complaint to be another continuation of Mr. Jančura's media show, which serves as an unpaid advertisement for his company and his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and that of my region, and I will call on other governors to do the same.
I assume that even on this occasion it will become clear that it is Mr Jančura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport and uses false and false arguments, Hašek said.
Jančura announced last week that he will invest several million crowns in advertising that will draw attention to the disadvantageous step of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue it after the New Year.
He specified that the campaign will be waged against corruption as such.
Jančura launched the campaign after the regions agreed to operate regional railway connections with Czech Railways and did not issue tenders for a contract of around CZK 150 billion.
According to Jančura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Due to criticism of train transport in the regions, Jančura has already been threatened by a ČSSD MP, he said.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a ČSSD MP, I know which gentleman he is, I won't say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Vaccination against pneumococci will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococci from January will break the established habits.
It is to be the first to be free for families and at the same time optional.
But there are already voices that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are culminating.
The Institute of Medicine is already setting maximum prices for vaccines to be paid for by health insurance companies.
Experts are also already clear about the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Free vaccines for August children
Since January, children born on or after August 2 last year can be vaccinated against pneumococci free of charge.
The condition is that they have not yet received a single dose of vaccination.
Those who started vaccinating last year or earlier must also pay for another booster vaccination.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococci.
Parents paid 1600 crowns for one dose or more.
When vaccinating the youngest children, four doses are needed.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies will spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns a year on vaccination doses.
But it will save on treatment that children without vaccination would need.
Until now, the state has given about 500,000 a year for all blanket vaccinations of children.
Reimbursed vaccination was introduced by the so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcus causes otitis media, but also serious infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
According to investigations in hospitals, up to 28 children under 10 years of age die of pneumococcal infection in our country every year.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they have introduced reimbursed blanket vaccination of children against pneumococci in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are opinions that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January, it is to be covered by insurance companies and optional.
Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the Nahlas civic association, suggested that mandatory vaccination would be better.
His association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccines.
Experts at the international conference in which our association participated were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that at least this has been achieved.
"I think that's the path we have to take now," Kalovsky said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the procedure of vaccination against pneumococci.
At the moment, we are not considering it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say
Hana Cabrnochová, chairwoman of the Professional Society of Paediatric Practitioners, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, a reduction in booster shots could be considered: "With this vaccine costing such a high amount, we quite understand the political decision that the vaccination was started as voluntary," Cabrnoch said.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of new parents to vaccinate their infants against pneumococci by next year.
Vaccination against pneumococci is also a breakthrough in that it is the first blanket vaccination of children covered by health insurance companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, saving on further treatment, Cabrnoch explains.
Doctors will have to buy the substances themselves
But this is related to the concerns of general paediatricians about buying vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines would be purchased by insurance companies, and doctors would receive them in a similar way that the state supplies them with substances for other vaccinations.
But some MPs feared that this could allow insurance companies to "take money out of health insurance".
Doctors will therefore have to buy the substances and wait for insurance companies to reimburse them.
According to estimates, individual paediatric practitioners will invest 40,000 a month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy, Cabrnoch says.
The son of an American artist 'stole from a museum'
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been charged with attempting to steal $20 million (£12 million) paintings from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
Mr. Frazetta and a second man used an excavator to break into a museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Sr., 81 years old, is famous for creating the characters Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The artist was in Florida at the time of the incident, the Associated Press reported.
The AP quoted an unnamed police official as saying that Mr. Frazetta Jr. may have been motivated by long-running family disputes.
To police, Mr. Frazetta Jr. issued an affidavit, age 52, that he did so on his father's instructions "to get into the museum by any means possible and move the paintings to the malting rooms," according to the agency.
Mr Frazetta senior denied granting any such authorisation, as stated by the Agency.
Labour opposes planned tax increase
Ministers advocated tax increases and spending cuts announced in the preliminary budget report against criticism from the opposition, businessmen and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling put it, the Tories have "missed" an opportunity to show that they are serious about postponing decisions on deficit reduction until after the election.
The chancellor has also come under fire for affecting low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, this mainly concerns an increase of 0.5% in social insurance and a 1% adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Anger over Social Security
Unions protested that low-income workers had been punished for a recession they did not cause, and warned of "problems" in advance.
Social security is increasing — an increase of around £3 trillion a year — which has outraged the business community, who have said it is an employment tax when the focus should be on rebuilding the economy.
This increase, limited to these incomes of more than GBP 20000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF PBR
Social insurance will increase by a further 0.5% from April 2011
The economic situation will deteriorate more than expected, by 4.75% this year
New tax on 50% of bankers' bonuses
Increase of 1% corporate tax for depreciation in small firms
Tax reduction for electric cars and wind farms
Increase in pension assessment by 2.5%
The Treasury estimates that some £30,000 income will be reduced by £90 a year and some £40,000 income will be reduced by £190, while some £10,000 income will increase by £110.
Ministers announced that their target of halving the deficit by 2013 meant "difficult decision-making", but insisted that 60% of special taxes should go to the top 5%.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Stephen Timms denied that the proposed tax increases and spending cuts were a "drop in the ocean" compared to what would have to be done.
"These are big numbers. This will allow us to halve the deficit, which is an absolute basic requirement for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he believed the economy should grow around the turn of the year.
But forecasting future economic growth - which will affect the volume of borrowing needed and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the Chancellor has been forced to revise earlier amounts.
In his opinion, he said the economy was contracted by 4.75% this year - far worse than the 3.5% contraction forecast in April - because borrowing was £3 trillion higher than previously estimated.
Missed opportunity'
The Conservatives, who launched a new propaganda campaign on Thursday warning of a "debt crisis" for Labour, said the planned £789 trillion loan over the next six years was unsustainable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how this could be paid, adding, "cynically" postponing this decision until after the elections - which must take place by June 2010.
"They have not added anything significant that was feasible," shadow chancellor Philip Hammond said. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the election if we win them "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the Tories' proposals, who would like to reduce the deficit faster and to a greater extent.
But Liberal Democrats argue that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts should be used to boost spending next year and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans are "built on sand".
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said of the timing of the message - for example, the aforementioned inflation will rise and there will be an inability to pay benefits next April - that it could lead to the Chancellor being charged in the election campaign if the money is difficult to recover a year later.
But Labour insists on providing special aid if people need it badly and the situation is revised in September 2010.
Suspicious budget'
Although ministers did not release details of spending after 2011, economists said it was clear that a reduction in public spending would only be the beginning of medium-term retrenchment.
The respected Institute of Budgetary Studies said the chancellor's figures indicate substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education and defence.
"It's really very painful so far," said its director, Robert Chote.
"All important statements will come after the election, if we win them," added Roger Bootle, economic advisor to Deloitte's account auditor.
"That was news about a suspicious preliminary budget. The markets are implementing it."
FBI Conducts Investigation at 'US Prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting an investigation at a prison in Pakistan into five Americans suspected of links to extremists.
The men were jailed for attacking a house in Sargoda, in eastern Punjab province, the US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was an investigation into whether these were the same men who had been declared missing last month at their home in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said it was also about obtaining information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani origin, one of them is of Egyptian ancestry and the others are from Yemen.
"If they were U.S. citizens, we would be very interested in the circumstances under which they were detained and under what circumstances they were there," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency had been informed of the arrest and had been in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are indeed missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested at a house owned by the uncle of one of them.
It said the house had always been the focus of local police and that charges had not yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillry Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters reported, but said the United States must "work much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to uncover the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train individuals."
The disappearance of the five students from their homes in Northern Virginia was reported by their families in late November.
Rejection of amnesty for Iranian torturers.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as it has been over the past 20 years, according to a report by Amnesty International.
The report details "torture methods" in the regime before and after the disputed presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied the aforementioned criticism of the human rights report.
Officials described the criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people have been imprisoned and dozens killed following the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the largest street demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of them were remanded in custody and prosecutors sentenced the last five to death.
The BBC's Tehran correspondent John Leyne, now in London, said that earlier in protests, Supreme Leader Ayyatollah Ali Khomeini had declared the illegality of certain forms of torture and banned their practice at the Karizak correctional facility.
But since then, almost no criticism of the legal authorities has been tolerated, as our correspondent put it.
False confession'
Amnesty International quoted a report by Ibrahim Methari, a 26-year-old computer student, who said he had been charged with "working with Facebook" and protesting the election results.
"I was often punched in the face," he said in his testimony.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened me with execution and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty reported.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Harroubi was detained after the election after protests and tortured to death in prison, while others were raped.
Iranian senior officials denied the rape allegations but admitted that torture took place.
Amnesty also reported the case of a former detainee who said he was held in a container with 75 others for more than eight weeks in Kahrizak prison.
Amnesty acknowledged that Iran's parliament and judiciary had set up committees to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response, but said the mandate and powers of the authorities were unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees had been published.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to turn the Bristol landmark into a downhill course for the race.
The downhill run for the park race attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for prize money.
At the top of the ski slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short ski jump in front of a 100 m long ski slope.
Fourth-year medical student John Hickman said it was a beautiful sight from the top of the downhill course, but it was truly daunting.
It was a wonderful sight to see the flickering lights of the city below.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country – some of them real talents," he added.
Prizes were awarded for the best stunts - or maneuvers on the downhill course.
After Thursday night's race, the snow was left to melt.
Still them and us
Can a Muslim be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters were calling for a ban on minarets and alarmist reports about the alleged Islamization of Europe are generally spreading, John Bowen, an American academic, has written and reported, wondering whether Muslims can integrate — and will — into one of the continent's most open secular societies.
After reading this book, some of the readers became admirers of the author's latest work, "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves" (2006), this elegant and debated study of the contentious issues that have divided and occupied the country for 15 years, and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book has a broader and much more ambitious scope.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now house 5 ÷ 6 million French Muslims, what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces."
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about gay development and rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does a Muslim have the right to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane contentious issues that are discussed, and that are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas that occupy the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, including well-known figures, including Tariq Ramadan, an Arab, Swiss-born Muslim scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open up a debate about how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen at the same time in a modern secular society.
They have no arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are suspicious of the real idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists interviewed by Mr. Bowen are inclined to believe that it is the antithesis of Selafi—the supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated in Saudi Arabia—a group small but influential in European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
It asks how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite that so doggedly defend the lay public) are really committed to the idea of pluralism.
He believes that Muslims probably have less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than developing pragmatism, he found a "tightening of the screws of values."
Can a Muslim be French? After reading this book, someone may be inclined to say, "Yes, but not now."
The world's bleakest prospects
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than the rest of the planet's environment.
The bounding ice is melting at an alarming rate, affecting animals and their survival like nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural sources of water, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers in their awakening.
In the book "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, author and illustrator, recounts the natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Well acquainted with the complicated history and practices of whaling, he describes a long tradition of polar explorers trying to seize the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a brave fourteen-year-old lifeguard who fought only with a musket wheel is indeed a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears that swam after the bodies of their just-killed mothers were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears performed at once in one circus tent.
Even today, zoo enclosures typically have an area a million times smaller than the area available to adults in the wild. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Drawing on the works of other writers and historians, Mr. Ellis often returns to the threat of hunters threatening the survival of the species.
Although hunting is banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunting and Indians on skis are all armed with powerful assault rifles to blast their prey.
Ironically, this takes place in the water north of these two hunting nations, and that the ice will end up being the largest.
In his new book, "On the Ice," former editor of New Scientist Alun Anderson offers science's clear and dismal responsibility for the Arctic and a gripping glimpse of how the future may change it.
Not everything scientists have answers.
Even meteorologists and oceanographers do not have an adequate response to the speed of change.
This for lack of exams.
Fridtjof Nansen's research trips in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave the first hint of how floating ice moves.
Cold War submarines then mapped the shifting divides as they sailed under them.
Satellite exploration and vast probe arrays in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but much is still taking place thanks to intrepid individuals camping in winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinarily fragile world of the catchment system inside the Arctic ice, created by the flow of salt water that contracts when it freezes.
But from the aforementioned bear to the microscopic wonders within, all of this is doomed once the summer ice moves, which will take place sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... That could be us'
6,000 Marines lay wreaths at graves in Arlington
Petty Officer De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours on a bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the rest of the Marines who made the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, it was a day to pay tribute to the men and women who once wore the same shoes.
"In a few months, when we embark, it could be us," Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me in order to show me respect as I am trying to do.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered that Saturday morning to lay wreaths at Veterans Cemetery in several departments for a memorial service in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Funeral Company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves at a memorial service in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition that Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen make the trip every year, stopping in various towns along the way to honor the memory of members of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcestesters are not looking for profit in this, wreaths across America that they are laying in other states.
That year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths at Arlington Cemetery, the Pentagon, Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial Site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation donates more than $150,000 to purchase and transport wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
As her husband is not buried in Arlington, Ms Hunt said it was her way to return what the victim was doing.
It's a small way for citizens to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in cloaks of warm cloth, volunteers walked through the cemetery on the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed to older graves from World Wars I, World War II and the Vietnam War, as these are not visited as often as newer graves
The mood was positive as the children played and held hands together as they transported the young pine tree to the greyish tombstones.
Each circular wreath was dark green with a small red arch pčes top.
Nearby, in Section 60, where most veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, there was indeed silence.
The associated service organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate the department, but the gloomy mood of the ongoing wars filled the area.
Some wept sincerely, others prayed, and families and friends clung to each other in the cool air.
Some read aloud the names carved into the stones, while others bent down to examine the small black-and-white name plates pressed into the wet mud where the tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from their eyes outside their son's grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the final resting place of S.M. S. S. David Shane Spicer, who was killed in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free... My son paid for it, she said.
"Even though I've been away for a long time, I want to be the one who remembers him."
U.S. government contractor jailed by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has jailed a U.S. government contractor who was importing mobile phones and laptops into the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The supplier, who has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the U.S. Interest Section in Havana, sought access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
Certain charges have not been made public, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreigner can be imprisoned for almost anything deemed "dangerous."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical essays, run the risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Mrs Sánchez repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to receive the prizes, but was denied permission.
The detention of the U.S. contractor may be the result of rising tensions between the communist Castro brother, ruling Cuba, and the Obama administration, which has been viewed as a "delaying tactic" in improving relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to report the arrest on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasized that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, the United States will take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average salary of a civil servant is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; These are mostly used for text messaging, as a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one day's wage.
Internet use on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors, and on some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to apply must report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
Detaining an American in Cuba is a rarity.
Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for offenses such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berben, a press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Ms Berben said she could not provide more information about the prison.
The imprisonment and detention were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open society — say, free cell phones — are a crime in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. Human Rights Watch, which recently published an unfavorable report on Cuban freedoms titled "The New Castro, the Same Cuba," in reference to Raul Castro's installation as the country's leader and replacement for Fidel's ailing older brother.
Vivanco said defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said that any solutions would be rather political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States just as the two countries are moving towards a larger dialogue.
Pakistani government officials uncover a conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered the alleged leader of a plot to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hoped the case could help uncover a vast network of terrorist recruiters who snooped the internet and sought out radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for a gray rebel figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one of the men posted a comment approving the terristic attacks on the YouTube video page.
Saifillah took the lead of these men, once they arrived in Pakistan, he tried to help them reach a remote area of Pakistan in the Pakistan Tribe Belt, which is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But the Pakistani intelligence official who reported the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convict al-Qaeda commanders and that the men were not part of the CIA's attempt to infiltrate the terror network.
As a result, they were dropped for several days in the eastern district of Sarghoda, far from the menacing mountains in the northwest that had become a haven for terrorists.
They were considered a shock troop.
The reason they were dropped off was stated by an official who spoke of maintaining anonymity given the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to get approval to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested in the administration of Pakistani law.
The case of the five - who remained in Pakistan and were questioned by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps, more importantly, determining who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has given top priority to attempts to deploy human resources to al-Qaeda.
The organization's recruiters act as watchmen, eliminating those who are not serious enough in their commitment to holy war and those who might be spies.
U.S. fake recruits have been subjected to special scrutiny by al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential access to American targets and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become significantly more cautious in recent years about who they allow to join them as U.S. intelligence agencies have recruited experts in their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to infiltrate these groups, is there no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has already been followed so much? said Mr Kohlmann.
This model is one of those that is much more web-based.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demanding climate 'action'
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets this Saturday, demanding stronger action on climate from negotiators at the city's Bella convention center.
Protesters put the number of many hundreds of thousands of participants in the event, but police say the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, with a handful of masked activists planting several small bombs near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On the day of the minor incident at the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city carrying banners reading "This is not Planet B" (i.e. second-rate) and one in Spanish that read "Earth says 'enough'."
The protest was attended by several celebrities, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said she traveled to her mother's birthplace in Peru and gave me information about the bleak state of the country, which is being exacerbated by the impact of climate change that is still happening.
"That's part of why we've decided to join this great march -- to walk through the world and appeal to the world's leaders to come up with a fair, ambitious and binding agreement," she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be carried out, it cannot be avoided all the time.
Police prevented protesters from approaching the Bella center, saying they detained 19 people, primarily because they were either wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
Such activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one bystander, who does not wish to be identified because he is involved in climate talks, activists disguised as athletes and in black suits planted several bombs near Copenhagen's main canal, which is located near several ministries.
They agitated outside the buildings, he said, starting with flares, but then followed by "several big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest is unlikely to have penetrated the consciousness of key officials such as Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked whether the demonstration had nevertheless had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of."
Then he continued in Chinese and said, "Because the scene is extensive, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful depending on everyone's prospects.
You can see the concentration of the general public and different sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: "It can also be said that it is an interference with the actions or freedom of others.
The test data revealed persistent racial differences
Last week's federal math proficiency certificate was a welcome element of good news about Columbia County's public education.
Although the district lags far behind the country's high-performing systems, the certificate showed greater progress among fourth- and eighth-graders over the past two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York City.
But what remains hidden behind the latest figures from the National Attestation Center for Advancement in Teaching is the persistent knowledge gap between African Americans and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score for white fourth-graders in Columbia County over the past two years has increased from 267 to 270 (out of a possible 500), but their African-American peers have increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
Indeed, the knowledge gap increased from 53 to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
Progress among African-Americans in eighth grade remains broadly even, with a statistically meaningless one-point deviation from 245 to 245.
The average result for white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture in six years is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth-graders in 2003, when the first NAEP in the district was conducted, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the result achieved in children from the oboiu groups improved during this period, the difference barely approached 58.
Some precinct education advocates said last week that the results, celebrated by Secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty, D, were more widely stimulated among white students where the scores were already high.
That would suggest that we've increased the combined support of those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and troubling, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equality of education in the district.
"I don't jump up and down for a two- or three-point dispersion," said D.C. committee member Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a fourth-grade daughter at Eaton Elementary School.
Often criticizing Rhee's style of administration, Ms Brown said reporting test results means high school in the city is in a desperate state and requires attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the positives and I respect that.
But what is appalling is that we devoted almost no time and energy to our secondary education.
Ms. Rhee said the district's effort is to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-achieving students.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of the new reading curriculum, Wilson's reading system, aimed at upper-grade elementary school students, and high school students who failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their academic careers, and fall significantly behind their peers.
The daily math and math curriculum up to sixth grade, emphasizing the games and real-life experiences that made it to the precinct under former principal Clifford Janeyi, can be attributed to the NAEP's progress, which was reported last week.
"And I just think we should continue to work and make the best possible interventions on those students who remain below class level," Ms. Rhee said.
Others said the NAEP results clarified whether Ms Rhee could continue to improve the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and funding for low-performing schools, which is needed to narrow the gap.
It's a definite dilemma for Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teaching professor at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studies test results in urban areas.
The conventional course of remediation is to focus resources and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of Columbia County.
In this way, the focus can produce political repercussions that run counter to an important agenda.
But the criticism also goes to other city leaders who are trying to maintain a middle average between whites and blacks.
We must focus on building a system of large schools.
We must strengthen the kinship of our schools so that all families, wherever they live, can rely on their children to receive excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now a school principal in Newark, said in an interview this week that an essential element of reducing the achievement gap is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, to make schools eligible.
You have to get up to 200 days to push through changes, said Janey, who signed a contract with his teachers' union last year for a 185-day school year, which he sees as a "symptom" for seeking a bigger increase next year.
Making higher education part of a better future
The tour bus pulled into Gettysburg College with a loud sigh of relief.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stepped out and rested for a moment on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Graciela's parents barely graduated from college in El Salvador.
So far, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never set foot on campus.
Now she and other eighth-graders in the group were exploring Gettysburg, where tuition was $38690 a year, their status being enthusiastic potential students rather than fearful visitors.
Yes! That's it! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, as the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? She said thoughtfully when they were told the low ratio of professors to students.
Pennsylvania Dorm was one of seven they visited on their three-day tour, and now they were completely preoccupied with the future news: The question is not whether you will enter the dorm.
The question is from where.
Of course, this is a major problem regarding the high number of U.S.-born children of Spanish immigrants who are expelled from college or become pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands who receive a college education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, one-fifth of this "rainbow generation" of Spanish college students — remarkable results indicate that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central Americans, made it to the United States without completing college.
Their success story is important, the researchers say, because it underscores their point of departure for a generation that played a marginal role in the country's workforce.
Those who achieved a college education say they had a natural affinity for school and an innate drive to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and looked for ways to make up for their ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciel and the millions of children who would like to graduate from college — especially if those efforts persist over time.
Considering that children come from low-income groups whose parents don't have the experience and ability to help them navigate the system, any simple intervention at every single point won't solve it, says Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American region.
We need to think about providing these preschool-age children with a safety net in every way to make them out of college.
The federal program that funded Graciela's rail tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million annually for local school systems to launch college preparation programs that begin for low-income students in high school and continue until those students graduate from college.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, more than one percent of whom have entered dorms, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraq's Ministry of Oil Reaches Agreement with 10 Foreign Oil Companies
Despite fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to get major oil companies to rebuild their ailing infrastructure during two auctions on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been struck between Iraq's oil ministry and foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are poised to play a significant role in rebuilding Iraq's oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies left with capital participation in just two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one submitted a lost bid.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements on fields that were auctioned in June.
The modest participation of US oil giants in Iraq's open oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, you have Asians and Europeans on the road in the first place, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news outlet.
That will be long before anything else is for sale in Iraq.
Security concerns, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the U.S. military, are likely to deter U.S. companies from doing much more business in Iraq, which arguably has the third-largest raw material reserves, analysts say.
U.S. firms have been at a disadvantage in some cases, with Chinese and other government-controlled energy firms in particular having noticeably lower operating costs and being more prone to risk-taking because they are unaccountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to enter into agreements with the Department.
Leading U.S. firms such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close contacts with Iraq's oil ministry and offered technical assistance in recent years, walked away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts awarded at the end of this week.
China's state-owned National Petroleum Corp. has bid for more contracts than all other companies and has walked away with large stakes in contracts for two main fields.
"We all know that China is striving to become a major economic as well as a technological force," oil ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be comparable to its competitors and will live up to its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that were pre-selected to submit bids, which were then compared by the ministry by price per barrel, and the ministry is willing to pay to boost output above current levels in each field.
A top al-Qaeda planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
A top al-Qaeda planner was apparently killed in a U.S. missile impact near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials announced Friday.
As confirmed, this could be the second fatal attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs killed when several rockets fell on their car near the town of Miran Shah in Sevverni Waziristan province on Thursday, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities said the missiles were fired from an unmanned aircraft of the type operated by the CIA in the zone of illegal indigenous tribes.
They were directed to a white car heading toward the Afghan border when it was hit, said an official along with Pakistan's cicilia intelligence agency, who telephoned from Miran Shah.
The official said local gunmen rushed to the point and quickly seized what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials quoted an unspecified witness as saying Somali was killed at the time of death.
Somali was cited as a high-ranking al-Qaeda military operations planner who directed the operations of terrorist groups outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in plots around the world, said a senior official, who asked not to be named, who cited the sensitive nature of U.S. air strikes inside Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, he was probably involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from the top leadership of al-Qaeda to plan possible terrorist attacks.
Another U.S. official said Somali had rapidly advanced in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not have been a household name to some Americans, but that he did not humiliate himself in any way to pose in front of us and our allies, another official said.
Now that his death has been confirmed, Somali is believed to be the second high-ranking al-Qaeda or Taliban leader to be killed since September, when Naymudin Yalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the Tribal Strip, and three other top operative leaders were killed in a similar attack.
The pace of drone attacks launched by the CIA has decreased from an average of about six operations per month to two since the summer, according to Long War newspaper records, a website run by a nonprofit group.
The downgrade may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability by also mercilessly killing people they suspected to be informants, the site said.
The top delegate of the United Nations in Kabul resigned.
The top U.N. delegate to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would step down from his post in March, ending a tumultuous term that has been marred by allegations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan's U.N.-backed presidential election.
Eide's departure comes because the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN delegate said he supported the increase, but expressed concern that the US timetable for the downsizing, which begins in 18 months, should be a call for other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
"We need to accelerate the build-up of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans to have confidence in the international community," Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment made must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian personnel assisting in Afghanistan's political transition.
The increase on the part of the armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has now said he would need time to find a replacement.
"As I said, it's high time to look for a successor," said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun a search for a replacement.
Officials said the choice was between Staffan di Mistura, who is of Swedish-Italian descent and formerly headed the U.N. mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, a Frenchman who previously led U.N. peacekeeping operations.
Eide's standing in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the state presidential election, of masking the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide denied the allegations, but said the allegations against Galgraith — who was released — "certainly hurt the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism with respect to international interference" in the election.
Eide said he had proposed a meeting with the Citizens' Representative Chief to coordinate relief efforts with the leadership of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, because he says he wants to strengthen their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the curtailment of its efforts in Afghanistan, saying the UN's cumbersome hiring regulations were undermining its ability to use capabilities.
The UN rules are such that I have only had the opportunity to recruit one person since May, he said.
This is a disaster and I cannot continue.
Gates: Iran faces more sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers would soon impose "more significant sanctions" on Iran over a lack of engagement in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Speaking to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long tour of areas where there are wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates downplayed the prospect of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good option for Iran, he said in response to a soldier's question about the likely development. ¨
One of the things that depends on me is whether I've learned anything from Iraq over the last six years, [that] is inherent unpredictability in war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could hit Iran's military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of those sanctions could also hit ordinary Iranians.
He said a "package of incentives and restraints" would require "to make the Iranian government actually feel less secure with nuclear weapons" because "its people will suffer extraordinarily" from the sanctions.
According to a statement issued Friday by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has engaged European leaders in warning that Iran will face serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program fully into line with the UN Nuclear Safety Committee and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on October 1, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks on curbing his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial portion of his stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed fuel for the reactor to conduct medical research.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement as a way to establish trust between the two sides and to buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to have withdrawn from interim agreements — partly because the Iram leadership is divided on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in terms of Iran's stubbornness toward the international community on some of the proposals that it actually agreed to in early October, I think it has put the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together on a path that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to proposals before returning to seeking other elections, including surveillance, what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations on Thursday condemned what it called "unfounded and unsubstantiated allegations" before some members of the security committee about Iran's nuclear activities and said it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to reach an adequate long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdistan region to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and Iraq's Arab majority, particularly over borders, property rights, and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce potential for conflict to prevent delays in U.S. plans to limit the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to dampen Kurdish concerns about the lingering depression. U.S. officials quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzaani, president of the Kurdistan regional government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In aging China, changing course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters reading that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to support more children" and "One more child means one more grave."
Then they learned the lesson that when official government bodies in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and aging population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples, their response was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all our time and energy to just one child.
"We didn't save anything for others," says Wang, 31, a human resources administrator who has an 8-month-old son.
China's more than 30-year-long policy of having only one child has been established, creating two generations of notoriously chubby and pampered children, affectionately dubbed "little emperors," and a population crisis threatens the country.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six before the policy came into force, according to UN data.
A population breakdown where the population aged 60 and over is predicted to grow from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. That's far above the overall average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater in wealthy coastal cities with populations with higher education, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over made up nearly 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission on Population and Family Planning, said many couples must have children to "help reduce the proportion of an aging population and a shrinking workforce in the future."
He says it's about "being old doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden."
Gradual calming
As inserted into the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably the most controversial mandate established under the Communist Party to this day.
Couples who violated the policy faced enormous fines – up to three times their annual salary in some areas – and discrimination at work.
Chinese officials have championed policies that have helped the country prevent critical exploitation of natural resources, while human rights defenders have been slammed for pursuing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to undergo abortions with their second child.
In addition, many couples have had to undergo sexist selective abortions, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have been gradually more lenient in their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they typically allowed a number of exceptions - including city dwellers, members of national minorities, and cases where a man and a woman were only children - and in 2007 they softened the wording of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Peking University's Institute of Population Research, said central government officials had previously discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, posters urging parents to have only one child were replaced by copies of the ordinance, detailing how legitimate it would be to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent family planning officers and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and slip leaflets under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial counseling for those who decided to have more than one child.
The response was cold, family planning officials said.
Grieving response
Although officials in one rural city around Shanghai have seen an increase in interest from couples who would like to have a second child after the campaign began, most city precincts did not report changes.
Huinan County, with a population of 115,000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only around 165,000 — slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai's Caolu district, said financial considerations were probably the main reason people didn't want to have more children.
They want to provide the best for the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said she would like to have two children and they were legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, who only have inadequate health and life insurance, provided by the government.
Without a safety net, the choice could be irresponsible.
Westerners misjudge the one-child policy as a contentious legal issue, says Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is married to her first child in the seventh month of pregnancy.
Yes, we were deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just politics.
It's about money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, a human resources manager, says they only want one child because she was also an only child: "We were the center of attention for our families and everyone took care of us.
We weren't used to provide care, and we didn't really want to care about others.
Chen Zijian, 42, who owns a translation company, put it much more bluntly.
For two-career middle-class parents who have reduced their birth rates, he said, being successful means being selfish.
Today's 20- and 30-year-olds see their parents as struggling through the first days of China's experiment with capitalism and don't want to make a living for themselves, he says.
One child in particular places enormous demands on their parents' time, he says.
The mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the contentious issues of propstor -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and strategy -- "You have to have a resume ready by the time the child is 9 months old for a good preschool upbringing.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, Che says, but not two.
"We are the first generation with higher nutrient standards," he says.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
The UN group outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by largely unruly attitudes and mutual recrimination -- refocused Friday on releasing a document that proposes ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years with industrialized nations bearing most of the burden at the earliest date.
The text, which can provide the basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminates the way forward.
But there was important progress in the negotiations, which took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Produced by the UN ad hoc working group, this text discreetly states how much money rich countries should give to poor countries to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a variety of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies so that they can limit their carbon output, and what should be the upper limit to the global temperature rise that policymakers will still be able to tolerate.
That will give the process a great deal of flexibility, said John Coequyt, a senior executive at the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, is an abridged from 180 pages of text from the meeting to focus on what the top climate official at the UN, Yvo de Boer, described as "the big picture".
It outlines the outlines of a possible agreement in which industrialized nations could collectively limit their emissions to 25 to 45 percent by a year compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 percent over that period.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union rushed through a pledge on Friday to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries embrace adaptation to climate change — from managing floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
Still, Friday featured the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevalent in last week's interviews.
U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Action Todd Stern dismissed a speech calling for binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries compared to voluntary for major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The shift signaled that the Obama administration had taken a harder line on China than Bush administration officials had done just two years ago.
The United States will not accede to the treaty without transferring major developing countries and taking action, said Stern, who also complained that the text was not sufficient to secure the restrictions and should be vetted by outside observers.
Stern made the comments an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei told the U.S. chief climate negotiator that either a lack of "common sense" or "extreme irresponsibility" led to a message earlier in the week that the United States would not help China financially to deal with global warming.
With the future of the world's major powers economic careers at stake, a tug-of-war has erupted both within the developing world and between the industrialized world and emerging economies.
The current struggle is mostly over the preservation of individual economies rather than the preservation of the planet, between China and the United States over the fulfillment of their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that two dozen of the world's most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take stronger action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate to Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that major powers were fighting over who should bear the costs of limiting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries had become much more aggressive in finding a way to prevent large emitters responsibly from taking action.
It's clearly a game of new economic hegemony unfolding, said Ulate, who also serves as a regional advisor on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change indicated that they would like to continue pushing for a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants said that the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations "has triggered a political crackdown on the entire political process" in part because they are now united and demanding action from growing economies such as China and India.
The meeting created new urgency once delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining issues before heads of government could compete for an agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as India's Environmental Protection Minister Yairam Ramesh and China's deputy minister, stepped off planes and ran through the halls of the Bella Center to closed doors for meetings and new conferences to lay out claims that will be considered next week.
The sheer sheer size of the rally - with 13,000 people moving to and from the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists staging ironic spectacles at night about the countries they thought had sent them, and hand-to-hand proposals passed on paper rather than e-mail -- dominated by the challenge.
The intensity is only a superstructure: almost all the key ministers were present in Copenhagen, and earlier on Wednesday 60 heads of state.
"We have fallen into high categories," said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, deputy minister for global policy at international nature conservation.
Heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first 140-mph-hour train redefined feelings this Monday
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle cut through the darkness to signal the departure of the train that revolutionized transport in Britain.
The country's first high-speed passenger train reaches 140 miles per hour and flies from Ashford, Kent, to London's St Pancras, covering a distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Secretary of State for Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes in boarding the first high-speed passenger train outside Lndyn.
He hopes the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the major conurbations of Midland, North and Scotland to London.
Neglected stagnant waters should reduce passenger and business travel times, and switching from planes and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate congestion on the roads.
Theoretically, the three major political parties have allowed themselves to be won over to this vision.
But the tens of trillions of pounds required to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle for projects and environmental concerns have now put the brakes on the construction of Britain's high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company formed in January to provide the government with a workable study, handed over its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times reported.
It provided him with a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
The new routing of London's connection to West Midland has been proposed to within five metres in urban areas and neighbourhoods where environmental degradation could be problematic.
In the open countryside, up to 25 m of the final route was planned.
HS2 also envisages identifying three options for a large-scale high-speed network running north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option is the Y-shaped conscription, with one high-speed line running to West Midland.
The line would split near Birmingham with one branch running from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another running northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle am Tyne.
One line should lead to Scotland.
"It looks like the most powerful choice has been made," said a railroad expert.
Once this is done, travel times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not open before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to more than one hour in the present.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 2250 miles per hour, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line is already being designed to carry 400 m long trains capable of carrying 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains could operate every hour on the London-Birmingham line.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if needed.
Due to capital constraints, it is envisaged that the existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Experts from the railway industry say that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement the scheme, but extensive public consultation and planning processes mean that a final decision will not be made before the general election.
Even if it sets the wheels in motion, the network should be built piecemeal.
Trains should first be put into service not on high-speed lines but on existing lines north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is seen as a crucial point of contact for ensuring the transition from aircraft to trains, a landmark for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers paid £75,000 mortgage on Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, the Tory front bench holder, was paid thousands of pounds last year by taxpayers for the orangery he built in his constituency home.
A prison party spokesman who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs lived "on rations" increased his mortgage to £75,000 to build an oak-clad extension in his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, totalling hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
The municipal authorities approved the claims in time and he was not questioned by Sir Thomasen Legg, who carried out the control of membership expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan made his demands "it could be cleaner or easier."
Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest Members of Parliament, owns two two-storey houses in the village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The houses are worth around a million pounds.
Downstairs there is a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the tax office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a winter garden to the house, which is referred to as an "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors describe it as "a greenhouse for entertainment and entertainment."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation on the increased loan during the last review by the Municipal Standards and Privileges Committee in the latest mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month that he had broken the rules after reviewing his spending.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the pupillary security to a GBP 271406 mortgage on his estate in London to a house in his constituency which he had bought in 1991, a year before he became a member of the House of Commons.
Documents released this week showed Mr Duncan had claimed around £1400 a month in mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to over £1800 per month.
The interest in repaying Mr Duncan's RBS mortgage could not have changed at this time, suggesting that it was all intended to finance a £75,000 loan.
The standard variable of RBS mortgage payments fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, while remaining.
The latest municipal document shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1250 a month in May this year.
Mr Duncan quit his job as shadow head of the House in September after a secret reporter filmed him and said MPs had to survive "rationing" after a spending scandal.
"Basically, it's nationalized, you have to ration and you're treated like a s**t."
He said: "I spent money on my garden and entitlement and a small fraction of what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't."
The MP, a millionaire from a former career as an oil trader, was first asked to explain his releases in May when it emerged that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, before being approved by the IRS that it "could be considered excessive".
One of the activists dug a pit shaped like a pound sign in Mr Duncan's lawn in protest after it was revealed that he had claimed £4,000 for three years.
When asked last night about the mortgage increase, Mr Duncan said: "It was for a capital increase, which was approved by both the IRS and subsequently Legg."
He added: "This is not a contentious issue of hiding and zigzagging or breaking the rules or anything else.
It's an absolutely straight line down, according to the rules, justified and that's it.
That would not be cleaner or easier in many other ways."
Come and see the cottage on the Brighton coast with an advent calendar.
The coastal huts of Brighton have found a new meaning in life during the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages creativity, invited the 24 owners to decorate their cottages for each day in December and to use Christmas colets as the theme of the décor.
The event began on 1 December, when visitors were allowed to see the last cottage from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and with a bishop's sandwich and mulled wine, provided free of charge.
Selected carols included Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, with the lodge featuring the work of Janetta Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a television marketing assistant from Hove, is a priest without a scholarship in the Diocese of Chichester and head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion much more important for people in a post-Christian society.
"Why should we, as a church, expect people to come to someone else's old building? I feel that the church should come to the people and serve in an awakening way.
"The idea of an advent calendar in cottages originated just as a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we tried to try and present it in a spiritual way."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday to demand a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, to be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrations around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on the occasion.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police sources and one hundred thousand, according to organizers, demonstrated in cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of a UN climate conference aimed at adopting by Friday an agreement that could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, said that the growing global mobilization, clearly evidenced by the current demonstrations, had contributed to making the "political toll" of failure in Copenhagen too high.
According to an AFP journalist, the incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the march began, when a group of about 300 protesters, dressed in black, began smashing shop windows with cobblestones and hammers.
Riot police immediately intervened vigorously.
In total, police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical individual groups that had already manifested themselves in April at a NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "indiscriminately" and stressed that about a hundred were "kept in the streets on Saturday night" in handcuffs and a sitting position, despite the extreme cold.
After leaving Parliament, the procession calmly headed towards Bella Center, where negotiations were taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get inside.
A podium was set up for the speakers, in front of which a spiritual candlelight meeting was held with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters came by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to Africans, there were a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue raincoats, formed their first rally in Copenhagen this morning at the call of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" for a "fair climate."
"Today we are taking to the streets to demand the settlement of the environmental debt in favour of the South," explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer say: this is the time, declared the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and watercourses are drying up, today we can walk in them and this has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of the struggle for another world has moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, one of the figures in the fight for another world, said he came to Copenhagen to "link climate and social justice". "Currently, there is no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world."
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people took to the streets, according to organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, marched in red and wearing scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred demonstrators took to the streets demanding strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in protests organized by the "350" movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Several dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia elects president, Georgia denounces it as a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist territory as independent from Georgia, while Tbilisi called the move a "farce."
Some 131,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the August 2008 Russo-Georgian war for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
Polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhaz Election Commission, turnout was 58% a few hours before polling stations closed.
The first preliminary results should be announced overnight from Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including incumbent President Sergei Bagapsha, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the election.
This election is a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has completely fallen into Russian rule," said his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 people, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separation from Georgia, after the conflict of 1992-1993, in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia is trying to show through the elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one stage of our new life, a new era of our independent state, Kvarchiya Svetlana, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted that she had voted for President Bagapsh, told AFP.
She was one of those who came to vote at a polling station at a school in the capital, Sukhumi, in a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian dominance is the main issue of the presidential elections in this region on the shores of the Black Sea, which boasts beautiful nature.
Across the small country of 216,000 people, huge billboards with Bagapsh are placed next to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials who had come to oversee the successful conduct of the elections received a warm welcome from the district mayor, Beslan Arshba.
"We Abkhazians are grateful," he said in a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support and, in particular, its decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, drinking a glass of vodka.
The opposition, which was represented in the election by former Vice President Raul Khadzhimba and two businessmen, Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the treaties struck with Moscow last year, such as the one that allows Russia to control Abkhazia's rail network for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he supports neither the current government nor the opposition.
An absolute majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win an election.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the runoff must take place within two weeks.
Climate: manifestations in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday to demand a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, to be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrations around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested around 700 people on the occasion.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police sources, and one hundred thousand, according to organizers, demonstrated in the afternoon in cold weather in the Danish capital, which is hosting delegates from 193 countries until December 18, negotiating an agreement that could come into force on January 1, 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the procession calmly headed towards Bella Center, where negotiations were taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get inside.
A podium was set up for the speakers, in front of which a spiritual candlelight meeting was held with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
According to an AFP journalist, the incidents occurred shortly after the march left, when a group of several hundred protesters, dressed all in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began smashing shop windows.
Riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened without waiting, knocking several demonstrators to the ground.
In total, police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical individual groups that had already manifested themselves in April at a NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a cobblestone, and four cars were set on fire near a squat near the incidents, which resulted in the arrest of about 20 people, according to police sources.
We are concentrating on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as police helicopters again flew up.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from major German cities, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European descent.
But there were also a lot of Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue raincoats, formed the first rally in Copenhagen this morning at the call of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" for a "fair climate."
"Today we are taking to the streets to demand the settlement of the environmental debt in favour of the South," explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, one of the figures in the fight for another world, said he came to Copenhagen to "link climate and social justice". "Currently, there is no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world."
Oxfam has called in several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen and former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to address the crowd.
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people took to the streets, according to organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly red-clad students wearing scarves evoking the importance of solar energy, demonstrated in front of the Philippine capital's city hall.
Several hundred demonstrators also met in Hong Kong and Jakarta to demand strong action against climate change.

Several dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The subjects of geography and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general grammar school, Chatel said.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said in an interview with JDD magazine on Sunday that history and geography subjects will be "strengthened" as part of the reform of general grammar schools, although their teaching will no longer be compulsory in the last year of a grammar school with a focus on exact sciences.
Now all second-year students will have four classes a week, and there will be the same general culture program for all, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "hypocrisy must be stopped" because, according to him, specialization S is no longer focused on exact sciences", but "basically the best students are in it".
The ES and L specializations cannot be for S sub-specializations, he continues, emphasizing, "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals complain that geography and history are not taught in the last year of vocational gymnasiums."
An Ifop poll published Saturday by the daily Humanité showed that seven French out of ten (69%) disagree with the government's project to abolish compulsory history and geography classes in the graduating year with specialization S, which is why many intellectuals and teachers have criticized the abolition, both on the left and some MPs on the right.
On the contrary, the minister added that it is "out of the question" to abolish the philosophy in the S specialization program of the graduating year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended the reform in teacher education, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for participation in Tuesday's mobilization against the project, which they said would sacrifice the pedagogical training of future grammar school professors.
As part of Master's Degree 2 (M2), they will undergo an entrance examination focused on their field at the beginning of the year and another examination at the end of the year to test their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will participate in professional internships during the second year of the Master's degree and for the first year they will act in front of pupils as a professor-intern.
If you add up all the internships that will be offered to you before the admission process, you will gain more experience with pupils, almost 300 hours, he continued.
The minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education", which does not yet exist in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to abolish the school map by 2012.
At the elite École Normale Supérieure University, experts have 15 minutes to convince themselves of the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the objectives of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the call announced in the morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC), at the initiative of the Ecole Normale Supérieure University on Ulm Street.
As one AFP journalist reported, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, which is a kind of one-day seminar consisting of fifteen-minute contributions by experts, which will be filmed and open to the public.
"We wanted to do something that would attract people and make them more eager to learn more," explained 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of the seminar, which was named after a fish from a local pond named by students.
About twenty contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines will be selected and he specified that the selection is based on their charisma.
"We can talk about climate warming for hours, but we can also sum up the basic goals in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel, who spoke in front of fifty listeners without pre-prepared notes, using only graphs, told AFP.
"It's part of our scientific work," he stressed, hoping that the audience would know that "the Copenhagen conference relies on very seriously prepared scientific foundations."
Videos filmed at these lectures will be posted on the school's website from December 15.
The next seminar "Ernest" is planned for February, and others will follow with regularity every two months.
Delays in payments: angry prison guards, planned measures
The prison guards' union announced a "general mobilization" on Friday as they demanded that they be reimbursed by Christmas for bonuses and overtime, the payment of which was postponed until January for financial reasons.
The prison FO (2nd Union of Guards) asked employees who would not be on duty to take part in a demonstration held on Tuesday morning outside prisons and to "block" them to draw attention to the "theft of their wages".
The CGT for prison guards (3rd department of the sector) called on them to "convene assemblies in individual prisons and initiate a substantial mobilization", saying that it was "shameful and unacceptable" that "overtime and extra pay for night, Sunday and public hours" worked in October would not be paid in December.
The first union of guards, the Federal Union of Prison Guards (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for a comprehensive mobilization (...) in order to show discontent and indignation".
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime has increased a lot in 2009 and not all of them have been included in the financial budget, but they assure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari had sent a message to the prison guards' union assuring them that payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts that prison staff are making to ensure that our prison system functions and modernises," she wrote in her statement.
I have instructed the Prisons Administration to take immediate measures so that the situation created by the wrong assessment of the number of overtime will never happen again in the future, Minister Alliot-Mari added.
December pay will therefore be low, except for executives, who receive the famous bonuses for performing their duties and meeting their goals, according to Ufap/Unsa, and for those "there is always room in the budget".
It is simply a scandal, the interregional union FO in Marseille has raged, announcing its decision to boycott "all meetings and summonses until further notice".
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or public holidays, if they are not reimbursed in December, as well as overtime, FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
At a time when they are giving us more and more work and tasks without making additional staff available to us, it is sad to allow the lowest ranking employees to pay for it, according to the CGT-prison guards in Bordeaux.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better off than others.
However, in any case, funds are scarce, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
Obama says he gives "better presents" for Christmas than the ones he receives
US President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family at the White House, confided to the "goddess" of the screen, Oprah Winfrey, that when it comes to gifts, she has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than the ones I receive."
The president and his wife, Michelle, spoke in a special edition of the show, which will air Sunday night on ABC, about how they plan to spend the Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, gets his gifts.
Santa Claus likes Boa, too, Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog will also "of course" receive a gift, according to excerpts from the show's preliminary broadcast.
And Michelle Obama also objected to her husband's claim about the quality of the gifts he receives: "Certainly not, I gave you nice gifts last year," teasing, teasing.
Well, that's true, of course, the president was forced to agree, but immediately afterwards he humorously pointed his finger at the first lady's pearl necklace: "And who gave you this?"
In this one-hour, very relaxed show with a famous host who diligently supported Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, the Obamas also talked about their favorite gifts they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a bicycle with a ten-speed gearbox, but also a basketball given to him for Christmas by his Kenyan father, whom he rarely met.
"I remember seeing my father, who came to see us for Christmas, and how he gave me the basketball," the president said.
It wasn't until long after that that I realized that he had actually given me the ball.
The first lady recalled the dollhouse.
"I didn't know how to organize everything in the house, so I lined up all the furniture along the wall instead of placing it around the fireplace, but I loved that little dollhouse," Michelle Obama recalled.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL says he is in artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was operated on again in Los Angeles for "injuries" sustained after major surgery he underwent in France, but the situation is "under control," according to those closest to him, while RTL reported that the singer is in artificial sleep to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker underwent surgery Wednesday night into Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors said there was an "injury resulting from surgery" for a herniated disc he underwent in Paris on Nov. 26, his press office said in Paris, adding that the lesions required "corrective surgery."
However, the singer's press department tried to reassure the public, saying the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical communiqué would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the main partner of the singer's latest tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into artificial sleep to avoid "pain and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens their eyes, we will have a little more confidence, RTL adds.
The press office, when asked by AFP, did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also reports that, according to "some sources", no drain was installed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated on at the international clinic Parc Monceau for a herniated disc.
The operation, which was planned several days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well known in artistic circles.
The doctor was not available to comment on RTL on Thursday.
After that surgery, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles due to an infection that occurred after the intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, told RTL radio on Thursday that his friend was going through a "bad time" but added that he was "not worried" about the rocker because he was a big "fighter".
"He called me just before we left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing something stupid because spending 12 hours on a plane after an operation like that is no fun," Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, reassured the situation, saying that Johnny Hallyday "responds well to antibiotics" and that the infection had been "stopped".
Mr. Camus also said that he had met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
The singer's health problems have only multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday had been operated on for a "small tumor of the small intestine" and then for a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, his every health problem has been closely monitored and commented on. Fans and journalists noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team again had to deny the news of a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Bousquet's debut in his favourite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Championships in the large pool, won the title at the 2009 European Small Pool Championships in Istanbul on Thursday in a discipline he particularly likes: the 50m freestyle.
On the first day of the championships, on which suits are allowed for the last time, only three world records were broken, although many more were expected.
One of them was beaten by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszt in the 200 m position race and the other two by the Russian men's 4x50 m relay.
Great sadness for Bousquet, who set the 50m freestyle world record, which he already holds in the large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, where ten swimmers started for the first time instead of the usual eight.
Bousquet beat Croatian Duje Draganj (20.70) and Russian Sergei Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30) as expected.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try to do it.
Like Bousquet, nearly all swimmers wore jumpsuits made of polyurethane, which will be banned from Jan. 1.
The suit has helped to 238 world records since February 2008 and its era ends in Istanbul, which first hosted it in 1999 at the same competition.
Using the jumpsuit this time didn't help German Paul Biedermann, a two-time world champion in the big pool in Rome this summer, who had the world record at his fingertips.
The young swimmer failed to break the 400-meter freestyle record (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian rider Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't give everything to that race.
I knew I wouldn't break the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival for the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: A panel of Romanesque sarcophagus belonging to Zola was auctioned off for USD 1.5 million
A slab of a Romanesque sarcophagus that belonged to none other than French writer Emil Zola was auctioned off Thursday for $1.5 million, significantly more than estimated, art dealer Sotheby's said.
The price of this two-meter-long and 63 cm high front plate, dating from the third century AD, was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in elaborate architectural décor, surrounded by satyrs and bacchantes, is a rare work, there are very few similar pieces in the world, perhaps four or five," Florent Heintz, vice president of the Ancient Roman and Egyptian Art Auction at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it's probably the item with the most bids, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The fact that Emile Zola bought this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The plaque was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borgia family, and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated her bathtub with her in her private hotel in Paris, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council before Marshal Petain came to power.
There it remained shaded for about fifty years.
Florent Heintz found out while searching the database of the Louvre Museum that this plaque was part of the "remains of Emile Zola" opened since 1903, a year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Interrupted attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico.
Mexico on Thursday deemed that the conditions for the transfer of Honduras' ousted president, Manuel Zelaya, were not met, as rebels refused to provide a guarantee of safe exit.
After the telephone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, everything so far indicates that there is no way to carry out this transfer, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
A Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya has flown back, a source in the Directorate General for Migration said.
The coup government wanted to force President Zelaya to "resign" and apply for political asylum abroad in order to give him a safe exit.
But the deposed president refused these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as an exiled head of state.
The coup government "experienced another setback when they wanted me to resign (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, often commenting on the political crisis in the Central American country for five months.
"I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here," added the deposed president, who has been holed up in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and has played a few chords.
The Embassy of Mexico has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transfer, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, the interior minister of the coup government, Oscar Raul Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
"I will not apply for asylum to any country," Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with Caracas-based Telesur.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors of Zelaya's departure mobilized supporters of the ousted president on Wednesday who gathered around the embassy of Brazil, where the military has stepped up protections.
Brazil's foreign minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the coup government's stance.
They show their marginal stance on international norms, he added.
Zelaya, who has grown closer to socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he held public consultations in preparation for his re-election, against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
He unexpectedly returned from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and found refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he gets out of there, he will be arrested and held accountable for the crime of "high treason" of which he is charged, the coup government claims.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize presidential elections on November 29 to replace President Zelaya.
In a controversial election recognized by the United States but condemned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance prompts optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended with a rise on Thursday, and the U.S. trade balance shows a rise in both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to data from the closing date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points and the Nasdaq, with technology dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 index rose 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35.
"We have good news coming from different parts of the economy," commented Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focused on "half a full glass."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are focused primarily on the U.S. trade balance numbers, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter."
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% in October compared to September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, had expected an increase in the deficit.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, especially exports of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of the main trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
However, unemployment rose against all expectations in the United States last week, with the number of job seekers reaching 474,000.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has fallen "to the lowest this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The stock market also fell.
Treasury yields with a 10-year outlook rose to 3,482% from 3,423% on Tuesday night, and yields for 30 years rose to 4,492% from 4,408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of regime supporters boo 'Ladies in white'
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana on Thursday to mark World Human Rights Day, preventing another rally at which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About forty "Ladies in White", wives or close political prisoners were booed in the street by supporters of Raul Castro's regime during their march towards the center of the capital demanding the release of political prisoners, the journalist reported.
Down with the Yankees!, "Mercenaries!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" the regime's supporters chanted at the dissidents with raised fists.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by plainclothes men who arrived to "provide security."
The day before, a similar rally against the "Ladies in White" took place in Havana, but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in Havana's Vedado district, about a dozen dissidents were detained by plainclothes police who were also planning to demonstrate on Thursday to mark World Human Rights Day, an AFP journalist reported.
According to the journalist, the police loaded dissidents who were booed by supporters of the government regime into civilian vehicles using force.
As a rule, the arrest of dissidents in such conditions takes only a few hours.
The 2005 winner of the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize, the "Ladies in White", organised an unauthorised march for the "release of all, according to the dissent, about 200 political prisoners", said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
Cuban authorities consider opponents to be "mercenaries" or "agents" paid by their archenemy, the United States.
A miracle, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration by supporters of the ruling regime against "opponents of the revolution."
Cuba, with the Communist Party at the helm and a one-party government policy, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of failing to respect human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A madman killed an octogenarian man with a knife and injured 5 people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A madman armed with two knives killed an octogenarian man and injured five other people in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) during peak hours on Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary results of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker allegedly attacked an octogenarian man with two knives and, for unknown reasons, an octogenarian man in or in front of a pharmacy at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of the police and witnesses.
A badly injured old man born in 1929 died in hospital from his injuries, according to the Alliance police syndicate.
In or in front of the pharmacy, the attacker then attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
My husband, aged about thirty, began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where an octogenarian man died.
The life of the second injured is in danger, according to police sources, vital organs have apparently been hit.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to hospital "in shock," a police source said.
The armed man, who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, a police source said, then fled into the street, still on the Jean Jaurès boulevard.
He injured two other people, apparently by accident: a thirty-year-old man and a forty-year-old man, the latter seriously.
How all this happened is not entirely clear, as it all took place in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he carried crosswise behind his back, said the head of the Alliance syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, tried to stop and disarm the madman, according to testimony gathered by AFP.
I saw a thirty-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They didn't succeed because he was quite strong, commented Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
A mob rushed at him, including a city police officer who broke his wrist in the process, he added.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at level 61, two city policemen, including their commander, tried to detain an armed man and were injured by their fists in the process, a police source said.
The incident took place in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passers-by came to tell me that there was an injured person outside.
"I went outside and saw a seventy-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place and noticed a big wound on his stomach," Frederic Allione, a thirty-five-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person of about thirty years of age arrived, also suffering from knife wounds.
The man, who was not carrying his identity documents, was later arrested by state police.
The Public Prosecutor in Nanterre referred the case to the Investigative Department of the Hauts-de-Seine Regional Police (SDPJ 92).
The suspected attacker was taken to hospital Thursday night.
He is in custody awaiting questioning.
A police source did not rule out placing him in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said it took six officers to handle him at the Clichy police station, where he was taken.
He was "completely beside himself" as "all madmen of this type, whose strength increases tenfold in action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again asks for the end of the prosecution
The lawyer of Polish-French director Roman Polanski again asked on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to drop the criminal case against his client, who is currently at his Swiss residence because of a moral affair that took place thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, an attorney for the director of "The Pianist," criticized in front of three judges of the Second District Court of Appeals in California the serious errors that occurred in the trial at the time of the events of 1977.
"I demand that the prosecution be stopped now and now," Hummel said, adding that the behaviour of the judge who ruled on the case, Laurence Rittenband, "sent shivers down my spine".
According to him, before pronouncing the verdict, the judge (who has since died) allegedly had a meeting with the prosecutor, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to jail – a serious offense against the rule of law.
Information about this interview appeared in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired", by the prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally claimed in late September that he had "lied" to the author of the document.
If the court refuses to halt the criminal proceedings, Hummel's lawyer will request a trial to present evidence of his claims.
The prosecutor reiterated what had already been said at the first state hearing, namely that there would be no serious study of the request to discontinue the prosecution until Roman Polanski appeared in court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before a court handed down a verdict on a "sexual intercourse" case with an underage girl aged 13.
Since then, he has never re-entered the United States.
Los Angeles Deputy Prosecutor Phyllis Asayam said Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the trial."
Do we want to tell not only Romana Polaski but also the other defendants in this case that it is possible to escape? Mrs. Asayam asks.
He is of the opinion that the director "demands a favor from the court while at the same time despising its authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to make a decision, also stressed "that there are other alternatives to escape."
Hummel was not alone in asking for the prosecution of Roman Polanski to be stopped.
The victim's attorney, Samantha Geimer, also again asked for the prosecution to be terminated.
Recalling that her client could no longer bear the constant harassment every time the Polanski case surfaced, she added: "No one in this room can say the trial was fair."
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on the orders of the United States
After more than two months behind bars, he has been released to house arrest at his cottage in Gstaad, where he is awaiting eventual expulsion.
Wall Street Ends Directionless, Held Back by Rising Dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended with no direction on Friday, with the market floundering between better-than-expected indicators and the rising price of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to data from the closing date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points and the Nasdaq, with technological dominance, left 0.55 points to finish at 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Frankly, the market is very calm, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains within a narrow range, the volume of trade has decreased very much and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "helped to improve market sentiment regarding the stability of the economic recovery," summarised analyst Charles Schwab.
In the U.S., retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate by the University of Michigan index, U.S. consumer confidence also returned, rising strongly to 73.4 in December from 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the indices were hampered by a new rise in the dollar price against the euro, the highest in two months, which "puts downward pressure on sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
As a result, technology stocks are losing ground.
The stock market fell.
Treasury yields with a 10-year outlook rose to 3,540% from 3,482% on Wednesday evening and with a 30-year outlook rose to 4,497% from 4,492% a day earlier.
Choosing Miss World again in South Africa.
After a month of travelling across South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World on Saturday are set to cross the finish line to achieve their dream of being voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion TV viewers.
This grand beauty celebration has been held around Johannesburg for the second year in a row, and so far five candidates have advanced to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Mao of Canada were voted Miss Sport or Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real whirlwind of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I have seen a lot of things and I have so many experiences!, she confided to Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which is being held in South Africa for the ninth time, will be broadcast live from Midrand, north Johannesburg, from 5 p.m. (3 p.m. Universal Time).
I could not dream of a more beautiful country in which I would put on a crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
"I'm happy I could experience it twice," said Miss World Ksenia Sukhina, in the hot southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous meetings with other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its "breathtaking landscape".
After a month of performances, rehearsals, press meetings and safaris, Miss is now concentrating on the contest itself.
India's Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who is also taking part in the election for Aishwarye Rai, the 1994 winner who both became Bollywood stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman's dream, but it's not just about looks.
We are ambassadors of our countries and I want to return home with a crown, says Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th edition will be in the spirit of music and dance.
The candidates will present themselves in traditional costumes and, of course, swimsuits.
The performance will be hosted by Chinese TV presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee chairman Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with warmth that is hard to match, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World pageant.
Like last year, the candidates took part in a safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time by bicycle, and tasted local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hand.
Unusual for a president, noted Miss Sierra Leone.
Undoubtedly the most beautiful memory will remain the draw in Cape Town (in the south-west of the country) for the World Cup to be held in June 2010, which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could meet people I never dreamed of.
I will definitely come back to the 2010 World Cup, says Miss Italy Alice Taticchi with enthusiasm.
According to son David, the news about Hallyday's condition is "very positive".
Johnny Hallyday's reports are "very positive," as his son David assured us upon his Friday arrival at the Los Angeles airport, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
""He's very strong and everything is going very well," David Hallyday said as he disembarked from the plane he flew from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (9 p.m. Universal Time)
The singer's son, who appeared calm, said he would report "as soon as possible" to Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinaï hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for a post-operative infection following surgery on a herniated intervertebral disc on Nov. 26 in Paris.
According to a press release, the singer was "put into artificial sleep" that night in Los Angeles for convenience, which is intended to prevent pain and facilitate the administration of treatment.
Johnny Hallyday has already been put into artificial sleep by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles. He was hospitalized due to an infection after surgery for a herniated intervertebral disc on November 26 in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be operated on again during the night from Wednesday to Thursday.
According to an AFP photographer, his wife Laeticia attended a school performance at a French lycée in Los Angeles on Friday morning, which is attended by their daughter Jade.
The head of the department of orthopaedic surgery and traumatology at la Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he is flying to Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer harshly accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, Camus said.
"I've heard about the possibility of a future trial," he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "went to Los Angeles too quickly, with the permission of his Paris surgeon."
I personally spoke with the doctor by phone and he assured me that this path was not a problem, which surprised me greatly, as I myself had already suffered from a herniated intervertebral disc twice, he added.
Moments before, he had stated on RTL radio that the singer had apparently left after the Paris operation without a drain, without anything."
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well known in artistic circles.
He operated on actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he was working at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove a hematoma resulting from a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, convicted several times in cases of medical malpractice, tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, an attorney for the medical association, described him as an "unscrupulous man" who is "regularly" summoned before the medical chamber and who is "far from recommended."
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux commented on the matter on Friday through his lawyer David Koubbi.
He reported that the procedure had gone "absolutely well" and that the post-operative examinations had been "normal".
The operation was not hemorrhagic in nature, so the introduction of a drain was not necessary," he added.
The singer's health problems have been increasing since this summer, and in any case, it seems that his next tour remains with a question mark.
Obviously, the date for the resumption of the planned tour on January 8 seems too close, Camus said.
The UDF raises the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre party to no longer use their acronym.
The UDF, controlled by François Bayrou's MoDem party, on Friday responded to an attempt by Nouveau Centre party president, Hervé Morin, to appropriate the acronym of Giscard's former party, saying it could not be used in any media outlet under threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to appropriate the acronym UDF, saying that François Bayrou does not deserve to bear its legacy after shaking hands with the left.
The defence minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC).
This move gained the support of MP Hervé de Charetto (former UMP, now for NC), who claims ownership of the UDF brand because he first registered it with the National Industrial Property Institute (l'Institut national de la propriété industrielle) in 2004.
But on Friday evening, a committee of the UDF Association, run by friends of François Bayrou who have no intention of being expropriated, came out of its silence and made a formal request to both the minister and the MP to stop using the acronym and hand back ownership of the trademark, under threat of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, you have raised alarming statements that you will propose to your political movement +retake+ the abbreviation UDF, the Association writes in its letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the committee, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance centriste.
At the same time, you have considered it appropriate to place the name +Nouveau centre+, with the slogan +UDF of today+, on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement, the signatories of the letter also state.
As you know, you have no right to use this abbreviation, explains the UDF Committee, which asks the NC movement to "immediately remove all references to the UDF name from all promotional materials, including (its) website".
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette "to hand over ownership of the trademark to the legitimate owners".
If you fail to do so, we will turn to the courts to ensure that the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members are respected, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "chose" to leave in 2007 "to form a rival movement, as others did in 2002, to establish the UMP.
The Nouveau Centre movement therefore has no right to use the abbreviation UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and to create a committee charged with defending the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
With regard to Hervé de Charette, the committee continues, "when he registered the trademark", he was "not a member of the UDF for three years" but of the UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent manner, he used the non-existent registration of the acronym to do so on his own account.
This tactlessness begins to turn into a crime, they declare, and then comment with irony on the NC strategy: "It seems to us that both in politics and in everyday life it is more valuable to make a name for oneself than to step out of anonymity by fraudulently adopting a name to which we have no right."
The case of Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for exploiting a state of weakness.
A court in Nanterre on Friday decided to try artist François-Marie Banier and hand down a verdict on whether he took advantage of the eighty-year-old billionaire's state of weakness to deprive her of some of her fortune, which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt accuses him of.
The photographer (62 years old), known for his photographs of famous people, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of a state of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of 3 years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in what can be described as the family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter attack each other and fight over the management of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be carried out by a panel of three doctors.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such an examination, certainly not under the conditions offered by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors elected on Friday are expected to produce a report by March 10, 2010, and to state whether Liliana Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness and at what time.
I think he will undergo it.
I will speak to her about the matter, Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said after the hearing.
As for François Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the court's decision.
It is excellent news (...). An expert examination will show that he (M. Banier) has manipulated this old lady who needs protection, he confirmed.
Two years ago, Liliana Bettencourt's only daughter opened a criminal case against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-rounder whom she accuses of taking advantage of her mother's weakness for years to donate a billion euros in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or paintings by masters.
Liliane Bettencourt, on the other hand, has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the merits of the lawsuit filed by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' Friday court speech at times turned into a family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt's lawyer produced three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, expressing her distrust of Françoisa Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt, according to the lawyer, adds, "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
Since she got married, I have never been able to talk to Françoise."
The Public Prosecutor's Office in Nanterre again found that the applicant's conduct was unjustified, all the more so because the guardianship judge had recently rejected her request to initiate proceedings for legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully capable of participating in court, she is not protected or under guardianship.
No one else will act for her," confirmed the head of the prosecutor's office, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court eventually decided to comment on Ms Bettencourt-Meyers' legitimacy at the time the trial began.
Managerial Revolution or the End of Economic Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain...
For more than a decade, the behavior of the management of large companies towards employees has resembled the attitude of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a matter of identifying with the "values" determined from above, as was the case before, when it was necessary to impose on the consumer products that arose from the ideas of the heads of factory technicians.
By making the customer the center of entrepreneurial companies, the marketing revolution has aligned market capture strategies in the right direction... Although authoritarian efforts to impose products different from customer preferences regularly return!
The passive attitude of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the visible part of a much larger general phenomenon that affects mainly managerial cadres.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, EI "requires all stakeholders to (...) proactive attitude and anticipability" and requires commitments from employees that are completely contrary to the income of authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for a managerial revolution that aims to put workers at the centre of the business as well as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls.
Internal opinion polls - such as the questionnaire presented to Orange employees - will contribute to a revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I am afraid not.
Mainly because I have already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure will return preferentially to it after various digressions... what she always did!
Secondly, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the severity of its own failures.
Finally, because most executives have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Because they are college graduates for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For the sake of intellectual convenience, they adopt the old behaviorist theory, currently revived by "neuroscience" from the USA and widely disseminated without much knowledge by scientific institutes and the media.
A recent Ipsos survey on the Figaro.fr website showed that it is possible to move the "levers" (sic) of managerial involvement, which only confirms executives in their position of mechanical control, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a finite vision of human behavior.
It consists in incorporating a fundamental insight into all management intentions and practices: For employees, commitments to the company will only be possible if they appear as a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of employee motivation is only dealt with in the Motivational Functional Analysis study.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of a predetermined doxy, which allows them, through the image that says about the company, to evaluate what it offers them to realize their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, managers can control, anticipate, and anticipate their "social performance" and put their HR management "on track."
In so doing, it creates fertile ground for the development of solid and efficient economic intelligence.
With his speech from Oslo: "just war," Obama earned praise from the right.
The American right on Friday welcomed a speech Barack Obama gave in Oslo the day before, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner had defended the concept of a "just war" against enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who initially mocked Obama's Oct. 9 award applauded the presidential speech this time, including Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
"I liked what he said," Palin, the muse of the right-wing Republican wing, told USA Today, adding that she herself had spoken out on the subject of "sometimes necessary" war in her memoirs, which are now being published.
War is, of course, the last thing Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
All terrorists should be apprehended there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from his predecessor, George W. Bush, justified the deployment in Oslo on Thursday and used the speech to explain his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another of Obama's opponents, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done a "very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who especially appreciated the President's reference to "the existence of evil in the world".
In a way, I thought the speech was quite historic," Gingrich said during an interview on "The Takeaway" radio show.
The former Congressman, whom some see as a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was thrilled to see the "left-wing president" remind members of the Nobel Prize Committee "that they themselves would not be free and could not present the peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, former speechwriter George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama delivered a "very American speech."
Not only did he present himself as a "citizen of the world" as always, but he "spoke like an American president" and reminded Europeans "that they live in a safe bubble that they did not create themselves, and that they are not doing much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few right-wing malcontents is the Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, who called the speech "monotonous, pompous, and uninspired," as he put it on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, for example, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is horrified at the sight of Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
"When we wrap war in the packaging of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
Nevertheless, the center-left press has a positive view of the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to consider the awarding of the peace prize to Obama premature, it judged his performance to be an "overachievement," even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo Accords should serve as a guide to international decisions in conflict resolution, poverty and oppression," the California daily wrote.
Obama "delivered a speech that was necessary," the New York Times said, calling the speech "simple and enlightening."
Road hauliers: three marathons to deal to save supply delivery for Christmas.
After three marathon negotiations, the road haulage union and TLF, the only employers' organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that ended the call for a strike and the threat that hung over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
State Secretary for Transport Dominique Bussereau expressed "joy" at the signing of the agreement on Friday after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, negotiators parted ways early on Friday morning, hoping that the text of the agreement would be signed as quickly as possible by the end of the morning.
This is despite the fact that three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew from the negotiations.
But it took more than six hours of the meeting, which began at 11 a.m., for everyone to agree and sign the text of the agreement at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would hurt businesses greatly" and "risk disrupting the end-of-year holidays," Bussereau said.
The text includes a wage increase of 4% for the lowest salaries (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest salaries increases from €8.72 to €9.06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort behind it, Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
Tonight we will instruct our members not to blockade, no blockades of supply centers.
But there may still be a few naysayers who are not satisfied," he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed the "right deal", although it was difficult to admit the increase in high salaries in view of international competition".
According to him, there will be an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest ones.
It is an agreement of common sense and respect for employees, declared CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also foresees a 3% revalorisation of travel expenses and a report on the state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow a focus on the issue of the 13th salary and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled the "€100 million reduction in corporate payroll taxes" that was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 budget bill, which was voted on overnight by the National Assembly Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate for an "identical" vote.
The signature allows this agreement to apply first to enterprises that are members of this organization, later to the entire sector, in the event of expansion by the Ministry of Labor.
It will take place "as soon as possible," Bussereau assured.
Only opposition from employers' organisations can hinder the process.
FNTR speaks of a "bad deal" as €100 million "has already been offered to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to act in an emergency not as a result of mutual analysis, but in order not to anger the turkey eaters in time for the approaching Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
For Otre, the agreement threatens to "bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry" over the next 12 months.
RER A commuter trains: weekend traffic interruption, unions dissatisfied with the RATP proposals.
The disruption of service on the RER A commuter train line, the largest public transport line in France, will continue over the weekend, as Friday's negotiations between the unions and the RATP management on the second day of the strike did not produce any concrete results on the bonus claim.
On Saturday and Sunday, the days of the important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will run only between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., with every second train running on the main section (between La Défence and Nation), and only one train out of four outside this section.
The connection with SNCF will be cut off at Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette department stores, which expect over 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP has tried to secure connections with the big department stores".
The RER A line runs from west to east of the Paris metropolitan area.
The section managed by the RATP runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one train out of two was in operation during rush hour, and virtually no train ran during off-peak hours, as planned.
As on Thursday, the residents of Ile de France arranged differently and there was no confusion on the platforms.
So, early in the morning, there were far fewer people than usual at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station, not least because pupils and students were missing.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), explained that he got up "an hour and a half early to make sure he arrived on time".
Saint-Lazare station was not overcrowded, the national railway SNCF announced, as a larger number of ushers and vigilantes were predicted.
RER A commuter trains operated by SNCF in the direction of or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station with a connection to the metro.
The next general assemblies of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, at which the results of Friday afternoon meetings with the leadership, which the unions rated as "weak", will be assessed.
The RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER A commuter trains in all respects, the adjustment of working hours, the course of careers, etc.
But that's not the point for drivers who demand a well-deserved bonus, according to Thierry Garon (Trade Unions South).
The RATP even postponed proposals on the premium for the time being, which scandalized the CGT, saying that the management "was not able to solve the problem, whereas it was possible for tour operators and SNCF".
At a new meeting scheduled for Monday, "the conditions of professional conduct will be examined more closely", the RATP said.
Which is why union officials think the company is "making fun of weekend travellers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers occupied the works committee at its Paris headquarters.
The leadership, which until now had refused any discussion during the strike, therefore decided to meet in the interest of "calming".
The conflict threatens to spread to RER B on Tuesday after Unsa and the Independents announce a strike alert.
The unions are demanding a premium of between €120 (Unsa) and €150, including €30 variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants (Independents)) and complaining about the deteriorating working conditions on this route, which carries a million passengers a day.
RER drivers earn between €2200 and €2700 of gross wages and €600 to €650 of bonuses for irregular working hours and for work on Sundays and public holidays.
The Turkish judiciary has dissolved for the Kurdish side, and this decision has serious consequences.
Turkey's Constitutional Court ruled on Friday to dissolve the country's main pro-Kurdish party. The decision immediately sparked protest demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could significantly complicate the government's task of reaching out to the Kurdish community in a friendly way to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become "a nest of activities threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Supreme Court President Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of hearings.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, needing a majority-seven votes to dissolve the party, Kiliç said, adding that 37 party cadres, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysela Tugluk, were banned from political life for five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Ms Tugluk and the confiscation of party property by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP has 21 seats (out of 500) in Parliament.
The party leadership had warned before the verdict that MPs would rather leave Parliament than serve as MPs without political affiliation.
The ruling follows a trial initiated in 2007 by Court of Cassation Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "orders" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is a legal political showcase for PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no "basic connection" with the PKK, but refuses to label it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court's verdict comes as the government extends a hand of friendship to the Kurdish community, offering a series of measures to strengthen their rights and attempting to limit Kurdish support for the PKK to end the conflict.
The DTP leadership confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to renewed tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where many demonstrations have degenerated in recent weeks against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is being held into clashes with police.
Since the announcement of the justice ruling, thousands of demonstrators have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a major city in the southeast inhabited mostly by Kurds.
Police used tear gas grenades and water cannons, while demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails or fired stones from slingshots.
About a hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said the justice decision would only "deepen despair".
Turkey cannot solve this issue by banning the party, he said in the press.
The government, made up of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We are opposed to the dissolution of parties as a matter of principle.
It solves nothing, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
The decision is a complete blast of the democratic proposals launched by the government, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for one of the deadliest attacks in northern Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
Snow can come
A pretty crunching winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the head of the winter department of FES technical services.
But so that its employees can try and learn to control all vehicle technology.
This weekend could be the first time this could happen, according to meteorologists.
Over 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of the snow and ice.
In doing so, FES is proceeding according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows across the board in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero, 20 so-called sections A of the bulk spreader will be dispatched, Brauburger explains.
These sections include main and transit routes such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also access points for firefighters, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and downhill sections such as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, it is necessary to sprinkle with wet salt within a maximum of three hours, which holds better, something around 1040 kilometers.
That's why FES starts at three o'clock at night "so that the roads are clear when the traffic to work starts."
It's not easy when it doesn't start snowing until 7.30am.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter technical services department, "because no one is willing to make room for the spreaders".
Only when it doesn't snow so much are the access and interconnection roads, including Rat-Beil-Straße, in turn.
The last priority is given to side and minor roads.
Brauburger knows they'll complain there.
At five o'clock in the morning, FES infantrymen set out, preferably cleaning dangerous places and crossings.
FES usually cannot take care of all bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that monitors mainly bridges from 10 p.m. to 4.30 a.m., Brauburger says.
Since glaciers form on them quickly, the spreaders leave as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
If necessary, the police will also call them.
Cradle of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animal, two meters long and 1.50 meters high, ran on two strong hind limbs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short forelimbs with sickle-shaped claws and a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing out of the ordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues write in Thursday's issue of Science that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these physical features.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in present-day New Mexico, which was then in the equatorial arid region of the supercontinent Pangaea.
Tawa opens a new window to earlier dinosaur evolution, Nesbitt says.
It shows us a lot about the kinship, distribution, and characteristics of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavations at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes, we found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, unprecedented for Triassic deposits, said team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
The find confirms theories about the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual find: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are very rare, usually only single fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts don't share this enthusiasm without reservation.
The find is not particularly sensational, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the assignment of prehistoric dinosaurs is usually disputed.
Experts debate, for example, when lizards split into three most important lineages: carnivorous theropods, which later included Tyrannosaurus rex, Velociraptor and birds, "long-necked" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and herbivores Ornithischia (bird pans), which included Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is the original therpod after analysis by Nesbitt and his colleagues.
It exhibits an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, Nesbitt says.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, researchers found evidence of air sacs that the descendants of theropod birds have.
Thanks to air sacs, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air sacs, says Randall Irmis.
Since a related line of giant sauropod later also had air sacs and light bones, this useful innovation was probably created by a common ancestor of both groups.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Since the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, scientists deduced that lizards appeared there for the first time.
According to this, the three lines of development split early and spread from South America to all the continents, which at that time as the supercontinent Pangaea formed a single land mass.
The team found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods, along with Tawa hallae.
The three cannot be descended from one common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there have been at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
One even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to the group of the heaviest dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His conjecture could give a distorted picture, as many primitive dinosaur fossils remain in South America, and they are rarely found on other continents.
How dinosaurs proved that they evolved from a relatively rare reptile lineage to the ruling vertebrates on earth in the Earth's Middle Ages remains a mystery.
During the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying lizards, and countless other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread throughout the world and many new species evolved, while relatives died out and the Triassic-Jurassic interface.
The success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs happened to survive, but the reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs adapted better so they could squeeze out the competition.
In any case, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped another group of animals that had also evolved in the Triassic and had lived in the shadows ever since: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna and Berkeley, California.
Associate professors from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin and Bremen joined.
The police eviction of the occupied casino of Frankfurt's Goethe University caused a worldwide stir.
278 professors and lecturers at Goethe University, as well as universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America, are in solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "do not approve" of the police intervention instigated by the Presidium.
Because the walls and artwork were scrawled, university president Werner Müller-Estler had the building, which was occupied by striking students and lecturers last week, vacated.
Five students were injured.
The damage to the cause, the signatories believe, does not justify the "forcible dissolution of self-organized teaching of students and teachers by police commandos."
The eviction constitutes an "unacceptable interference" with the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "illegitimize and criminalize the protest" and distracts attention from the content.
The Presidium avoided the necessary discussion.
The speakers call for the criminal prosecution to be stopped.
It is claimed that the majority of strikers did not support material damage.
Justified protest
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one's future, says Alexander Klein, secretary of the Verdi Land Youth.
Hessian Science Minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) has so far defended the actions of the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the University President.
Destruction and occupation are absolutely unacceptable means, she said on Thursday in Aktuellen Stunde (Current Hour) in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have sympathy for the protest, but we have no sympathy for vandalism," said CDU member Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and the Linke saw it differently.
The CDU is taking painted walls as an excuse to criminalize protest, Janine Wissler (Linke) said.
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, the eviction took place.
Linke has filed a motion calling on the Home Secretary to report on police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years it was a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a heavily guarded location where secret weapons research was conducted.
Today, this district with 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centers are located here.
Since September 2008, the representatives of Zelenograd have established contacts with the Frankfurt Science Center Riedberg - with university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several reciprocal visits, and on Wednesday Zelenograd and Ridberg signed a "Protocol on Close Cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Roslyak and Zelenograd Prefect Anatoly Smirnov, while Edwin Schwarz, Chief Planning Officer, signed for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in scientific research will go to a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be allowed to establish themselves in the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large concerns Sitronics and Rossiyskaya Elektronika.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") got its name from the forested hilly landscape in which research facilities are set.
Stuttgart brake
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be adequately prepared at all.
For supporters of the project, it is quite simply the "new heart of Europe".
Well. The S21 is more than the opening of a railway station, more than a monstrous structure that plunges the capital of Baden-Württemberg into desperate construction chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was created from the spirit of the 80s.
Head stations with tracks that ended in the city centre were considered to be 19th century transport and technical fossils that act as brakes on modern rail transport, as it took enormous time to change locomotives from rear to front.
Stop, stop for a while, keep going - that's how it should work.
And that's why the main stations are disappearing: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies about halfway along the trans-European railway line between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan about "the heart of Europe".
It really starts with the S21, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves recognized that in the Hessian and Bavarian cities the start of construction was almost unfinanceable.
Since there are modern shuttle trains with motor and control vehicles at both ends, the main stations no longer have problems with entering and exiting.
Still: It starts with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE line to Ulm.
It was pushed through by state and local politicians.
The railways cooperate, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the country are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state concern.
Urbanistically, the project can still be excused in some way.
A new urban space will be created, which - if we believe the computer pictures of the designers - will contain a lot of greenery.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The passable station and the construction of the line are intended for passenger transport, which - typically in the 80s - was attributed to a huge increase.
At that time, there was no competition from cheap flights.
However, modern transport policy must first and foremost be about strengthening freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than on-road transport.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains due to steep climbs.
Even more serious is that the S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros were to be buried in Swabia.
This is the official figure.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be a shortage of funding for additional nodal points and bottlenecks in the network.
There are sixty larger projects on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the construction of a roughly 180-kilometre-long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, construction on this route has been carried out at a slow pace.
Here it would be necessary to push hard.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The Rhine Valley line becomes the bottleneck of international freight traffic: right in the heart of Europe.
Government examines airport ruling
The state government has left it open in the Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will oppose the ruling of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) regarding the ban on night flights and have it revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to legally assess the more than 400-page VGH ruling, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
VGH in Kassel today explained in writing that the state would have to modify the night-time flight ban in the event of the construction of the planned northwestern runway of Frankfurt Airport.
The authorisation of 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the provincial government, does not correspond to the legally mandated protection of the population from night aircraft noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4 whether to request a review of the ruling.
The opposition criticized the postponement and urged government representatives to abandon the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD faction leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to revisit the promises it made before the election to ban night flights. Otherwise, it can be classified as a "violation of the word".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word, Green Party leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the FDP's election slogan "We keep our word."
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's reproach, saying that the provincial government is trying to get to its night flights by "twisting the law and tricks".
Precise legal control takes time.
The coalition does not want to work on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His faction's statements on the ban on night flights have never been what the opposition is reporting.
U.S. Banks Repay Aid
America's crisis-stricken big banks are freeing themselves from state shackles.
Bank of America repaid a total of $45 billion (about 30 billion euros) in aid from the Tarp bank rescue fund on Wednesday.
According to a CNBC report, Citigroup is also planning to repay state aid.
Thus, the institutes want to get rid of the restrictions that have occurred by accepting money - limiting the payment of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America has raised a good $19 billion of net money from investors through convertible bonds.
The rest of the amount was taken from its coffers, which were filled, among other things, thanks to union sales.
On Wednesday evening, the bank's chairman, Kenneth Lewis, specifically thanked the American taxpayer: The cash injection has helped us get through a difficult time.
The financial institution hurt itself at the height of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to free itself from its obligations to the state by raising money on the capital market.
Citing sources, CNBC reported that the U.S. bank could announce a capital increase of around $20 billion as early as Thursday.
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley repaid the aid.
Speed dial
After all, it went faster than expected.
The station unveiled a successor just two weeks after ZDF's board of directors ousted editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender.
Last night the committee wanted to agree on that person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in the capital Berlin, was identified as the favorite.
But the station did not confirm this - officially, so as not to get ahead of the process.
However, the fact that they did not want to harm ZDF intendant Markus Schächter if this proposal did not pass the board of directors may also have played a role.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the board's 14 members.
The result of the vote was not known before the deadline for this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter's proposal to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract for another five years failed on the board of directors.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's loss of mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, though it was to be expected.
The EU's majority on the board of directors had signaled weeks before the election that it did not want to confirm Brender in office.
The opposition to the editor-in-chief was organized by the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to remain in the office of highly respected editor-in-chief, arguing that ZDF's quota had fallen under Brender.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on ZDF was sharply criticized.
Most recently, 35 state lawyers intervened in the debate, calling Koch's actions unconstitutional.
It was no use.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance studies.
He then worked for the Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey joined ZDF, first to the "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal assistant to the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 Washington correspondent; until 1998 head and presenter of "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 Head of Foreign Policy of ZDF; since then, head of the main studio of ZDF.
After Brender, who was voted Medium Magazine's journalist of the year on Wednesday, was ousted, the Greens announced they would file a constitutional challenge.
Koch's opponent on the board of directors, Rhine-Palatinate Premier Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal states should change the state contract with ZDF so that the intendant's personnel proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also rejected the exclusion of party politicians from the supervisory boards of ZDF.
Brender's presumptive successor, Peter Frey, made a clever chess move to the board of directors - he strongly criticized the board for it immediately after Brender's ouster.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, both Schächter could nominate him to the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, and he could be elected by the board of directors without suspecting that the party member would be pushed into office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is classified as a left-liberal anyway.
Study gets rid of junk
Partial success for students: After a year of strikes, culture ministers finally went to the federal states on Thursday: At a conference of ministers of culture and university rectors, both sides agreed that there is a will to improve study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to master their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the burden of examinations: in principle, each study module should end with a single examination.
In addition, the workload of learners should be checked, and a "real and defensible rate" should be guaranteed.
To do this, politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Länder undertake to develop a more flexible common structural assignment for bachelor's and master's degree courses.
Earth deviations should cease to exist.
Fewer tests
Since the start of the student protests in June, culture ministers and university rectors have had winged words about better study in their mouths.
Now, for the first time, they are filled with specific content.
The so-called accreditation board has decided to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module will usually end with only one examination," reads the 30-page report, which is partly intended to regulate the approval of fields of study.
"Significantly lower exam loads," declared the chairman of the accreditation board, Reinhold Grimm, "to stop the erroneous development that significantly limited the difficulty of studying."
To do this, the "difficulty of study" is to be the "decisive criterion" in the future in implementation.
Modules and contents "must be strictly checked" so as not to "unnecessarily restrict students in their choice
seminars".
Students would be "entitled to a space that allows and encourages self-initiative."
The rules should apply when approving new fields of study, but also for existing fields of study after review.
These need to be "re-accredited" every five years – but this means that it will take until 2015 for all fields of study to be reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies throughout Germany are responsible for this, which are subordinate to accreditation boards set up by the Länder.
In October, the culture ministers "emphatically" called on the federal states to influence the agencies in such a way that the content of the curriculum was not too large and the examination regime was not strict.
In the individual Länder, universities and higher education institutions have already agreed with the provincial ministries on appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate is the only country to have pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna Process.
Higher education institutions should primarily pay for consultation programmes and study counselling, and strengthen examination and alien offices.
Countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to submit an amendment to the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
According to her, only one single examination should be needed to complete a study module.
The formation of studies should be even more flexible, with recognition of examinations from other higher education institutions to be guaranteed and access to the Master's degree to be facilitated.
By the end of next year, the difficulty of all fields of study in the country should be checked.
The government and the opposition again argued on Thursday over study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the resolution.
The Federal Board of Directors of the Juso Higher Education Groups has called for education policy to not take place in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, students as affected persons should "have a say in it".
Future academics also received support from the president of the Conference of University Rectors (HRK), Margreta Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with culture ministers with whom HRK consulted on a joint reform report.
According to the Department of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolutions did not go far enough: They demand a legal entitlement that would allow any graduate with a bachelor's degree access to a follow-up master's degree.
Secondly, the Länder must ensure that tomorrow there are enough Master's degree places with the best possible study conditions available for today's generation of Bachelor's degree students, said GEW Board Member Andreas Keller.
The Länder have to employ many more speakers.
However, the ministers of culture did not comment on free access to master's programmes.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Getting in and out of Germany is nice, almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, who in this torn piece of language thematizes the experience of the arrival of a dissident who gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, first working as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer for a children's book publishing house, then moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he lectured poetry at the legendary Goethe University in Frankfurt, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
There was considerable extra-literary commotion last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich on "German literature in Romania in the mirror and broken mirror of its security acts."
Visibly insecure and taken aback, Söllner left a statement in which he confessed to collaborating as a secret informant for the Romanian Securitate in front of fellow writers who were Romanian Germans, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present, Söllner was awarded the German Language Prize in 1989.
Attempts at recruitment are said to have begun inconspicuously, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner continued, "someone who has not sufficiently resisted attempts at intimidation by the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is the secret agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary confrontation with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that flags the depths and infamy of a political system based on control and spitzing.
Werner Söllner is not only the perpetrator, at least if it can be said according to the current state of knowledge, but he is also a victim.
In the Securitate acts, secret agent Walter played a role, Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession, referring to the positive influence of secret agent Walter.
He "cut me out" in all the important points for him, Markel says.
He has a moral obligation to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in this form and before this audience, but absolutely surprising is not the admission of a former dissident and his collaboration with the Romanian secret service.
Herta Müller had already written, in July, reading her own 914-page files, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the Securitate spies.
Those affected, it can be assumed, will speculate and in some cases even know which name is hidden behind the code name Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike in the domestic inspection, which has since been very certain, of the files of Stazi, the manipulation of the estate of the Securitate's control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic education has been thwarted and restricted.
One of Birthler's offices, which corresponds to the National Securitate Council (CNSAS), was only established in 1999, and the issuance of the act has been rather lengthy ever since.
Only since 2005 there is a law that governs the administration of the folders.
That former Securitate members still have a lot of influence in Romania was demonstrated after the Nobel Prize was published for Herta Müller by an interview in which one of the former Securitate bosses from Timisoara expressed his dismissive of the winner of the award.
She is said to have psychosis, after all, she was interrogated only once.
The disgrace to power was expressed here quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, the Söllner case, as in connection with concealed wrongdoing, raises inevitable questions.
Why now? Who was harmed? The special reaction of the audience to Söllner's confession makes it to be expected that the continuation of this chapter will be determined more by the desire for knowledge than by the attribution of guilt and shame.
This is more than a footnote to the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday.
Champions League Saturated Deposit
It looked as if a cleanly dressed sales representative had arrived from a cute Christmas party at which a sporting goods manufacturer was handing out sweets when new VfBr coach Christian Gross boarded the summoned C-Class Mercedes a quarter of an hour after midnight, accompanied by an orange-coloured sponsor's bag. ¨
A man with a striking bald patch let himself be driven around a city still foreign to him.
Otherwise, he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and drunk with happiness, the 55-year-old was also little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work will continue.
Or maybe it's just beginning.
In the words of the Swiss, who has only been committed three days ago: "We may have reached the eight-finals", in the Champions League thanks to a 3-1 win over Unirea Urziceni of Romania, "but we must not be dazzled by success: it will be a brutally tough fight against relegation."
A "far more important task" stands before us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the premier class in Mainz on an ordinary league day.
And to prevent obvious weaknesses again after three quick goals by Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Draw
The Champions League Semi-Finals (matches 16/17 + 23/24 February/9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of the explosive accession of Babbel's successor will thus be preserved.
Not only with the supposed healer, who gave the insecure Stuttgart professionals self-confidence, willingness to commit and joy in the game in a short time.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and encouraged them to be bolder, Gross explained the simple-sounding successful recipe, which has not proven any effectiveness under therapist Babbel.
He unleashed a certain magic, admitted Babbel's supporter Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you would not think possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a weeks-long break caused by injury, became the best player on the pitch thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the detected "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working methods of his new superior: "This is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
Under Babbel, this was clearly lacking.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, warns sports chairman Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs more consistency.
Like Gross, players and managers do not want to overestimate a victory against a weakened substitute and completely overloaded Romanian host's defence.
They would have won in Glasgow before a nasty awakening after a 4-0 defeat at Leverkusen.
And sporting chairman Horst Heldt reminded that while one goal of the season has been achieved, the other is still a long way off.
We are not over the water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first home win in three months was due to the weekend's events, which freshly revived in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
There are decisions made by others and not by Jens, Heldt replied to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He threw weak leadership at the board and decided to change the coach after pressure from teenage fans.
Even the cancellation of his day off after matches was described by Lehmann as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's remarks "articulate pure egotism," Heldt replied, announcing the consequences for the goalkeeper.
Both forty-year-olds will probably no longer have any joy in life.
In any case, they agree with the others that without the work of the deposed coaching team, such a strong and combative performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great share of success," Heldt and Lehmann say in unison — and the man with the plastic bag agrees.
World Heavyweight Championship fight
Passionate duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of world champion Vitaly Klitschko.
However, after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his WBC heavyweight title.
The judges' verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitaly Klitschko remains the world heavyweight boxing champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion beat American Kevin Johnson on points (120-108, 120-108, 119-109) on Saturday night in Bern.
This is Klitschko's third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Prior to that, the Ukrainian was twice world champion in the WBO and WBC organizations.
Unfortunately, it did not turn out the k.o. that everyone expected.
Klitschko improved his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, having been defeated twice due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson was defeated for the first time in his 24th fight.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Bern arena, the 2.02-meter-tall Klitschko led the fight primarily with his left-hander.
Eleven centimeters shorter Johnson, who before the duel announced the end of the Klitschko era, but withdrew from the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not deliver the decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
Overall, passive Johnson did very little for the challenger and just tried to get into the next rounds.
Although Klitschko provoked with words and gestures, his punches rarely hit the world champion.
But even so, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought Klitschko for a full twelve rounds.
The challenger caused a stir in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko as a "nasty zombie" who "can't do anything properly."
During a weigh-in on Friday, the champion was provoked, pulling his sunglasses off Johnson's nose "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth win after Klitschko's return
Klitschko remained undefeated after his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008.
After a break of almost four years, he beat Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back "his" WBC belt, which he had previously surrendered without a fight.
He defeated Cuba's Juan Carlos Gomez in his title defence that year and Chris Arreol of the United States in September.
"I only got one punch in this fight and physically I'm in good shape," Klitschko said.
His dream, however, remains to defend all four important titles in the family.
His brother Vladimir is a WBO and IBF World Champion.
But Britain's David Haye wears the WBA belt after dethroning the 2.13-metre tall Nikolai Vulaev in November.
Haye cancelled his fight against Klitschko in the summer, which was scheduled for September.
His promoter company is reportedly planning a fight against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green faction leader Jürgen Trittin called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar over misinformation about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and Linke (Left) are calling on the chancellor to provide an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has deliberately deceived himself.
The minister said a "knowingly untruth" about the deadly bombing of two tankers in September, Green faction leader Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday's ARD news program "Tagesschau".
Let's call it the usual expression: He lied.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That's the gist of the NATO report that Mr. Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it emerged that the attack was not just about destroying hijacked trucks, but about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
The US airstrike, requested by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, killed or injured up to 142 people, according to a NATO investigation.
The Greens, the SPD and the Linke called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to immediately address the Bundestag and also clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Mrs Merkel must explain whether the targeted killing strategy is part of the Bundestag's Afghan policy - and whether the Chancellor's Office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved the new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green Party colleague Renate Künast have urged.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm flatly rejected the criticism.
The chancellor's office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts were also voiced about the Ministry's account of the background to the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, the two informed Guttenberg correctly and completely about the background to the attack on the tankers.
It was officially said that they should deny the existence of NATO reports and withhold sensitive details from the minister.
However, those close to the two top officials said that they had alerted the Ministry of Defense to several reports, among them a two-page document by Colonel Klein in command and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert should have asked in a letter in the meantime for clarification of the situation.
It is recorded that no reply has yet been received.
The ministry did not comment on the criticisms on Saturday, pointing out that this would be addressed in the Bundestag's investigative committee, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Worlds of dreams
Some see images and hear voices in the waking state that others do not see and hear.
It is not only mentally ill or drugged people who blur the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as this happens in sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we are allowed to surround ourselves with the wildest fantasies and fantasy delusions.
However, those who experience dream states in wakefulness, see and hear things that others do not see and do not hear, are usually considered crazy or drug addicted, or at least a weirdo.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in the mentally ill or in drug intoxication.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures, or write novels occasionally blur the boundaries between dream, imagination, and reality.
Dream-altered states of consciousness can occur in various forms, at best we call them visions, at worst delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New-Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of delirium, psychoses and hallucinations can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions occur when the balance of neuronal transmitters in the brain – primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine – is derailed and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity doesn't have much over him
The connection between error and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since antiquity.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, noted in 1861 "the great similarity of delirium with dream states", for Sigmund Freud dream was even "psychosis, with all nonsense, delusions, deception of the senses".
It's autumn 2001, Henning T. is turning into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and garishly colored.
Gravity has no power over him, hovering near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devil figures with blood-red grimaces, baring their teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, fiery boots, throw him against walls, feel pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices come from the walls and from the radio.
He can no longer stand voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. rips two cables out of the stereo, knots them into a loop and fastens it to a hook on the ceiling.
He stands on one of the speakers and puts the loop around his neck.
Jumps.
The loop loosens.
Learn, voices shout in chorus, tearing his eardrums, "go to the clinic and get treated!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, has experienced six acute psychoses, the last 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD was launched.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoic psychosis, besides he is manic-depressive, takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness and has been married for three years.
"In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and the deepest doubts," he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality
About one percent of people fall ill with schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and in psychiatric clinics it is the second most frequently treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, sufferers can usually no longer distinguish between the inner and outer world, they get into an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, size illusions, relationship illusions or the illusion of persecution.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices - voices that command, comment or conduct dialogues.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The affected person is not able to distinguish the important from the unimportant, the brain can not filter out disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream, psychosis opens the floodgates to a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the General Psychiatry Clinic of the University Clinic of Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the action, everything has meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, becomes, as in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot actively form them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is usually not possible with them, ghosts are a terrible reality, awakening is impossible.
Experiencing a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, says Fuchss, "however, the sensory and spatial structure of reality, which one perceives in psychosis, remains essentially preserved."
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of experience occurs in a real framework.
Scientists are still faced with the puzzle of why exactly our brain does such flips.
Emergencies can lead to a person's short-term loss of touch with reality, Fuchs says.
But not everyone develops into psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists assume that affected people have minimal brain damage.
It is thought that neuronal maturation of the brain will be damaged at an early stage of development, for example by viral diseases of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
However, it remains a mystery how a malfunction of the neuronal system, which has not manifested itself for many years, occurs.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis, if there is a predisposition to it.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis, as they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain boils
The crazy thing is that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive medications, others give money for drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten from Lübeck.
Whether we perceive delusions as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, and last year he interpreted his results in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (The Unreal World in Our Heads).
Hallucinations are typical accompanying phenomena of psychoses, but also surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to psychological disorders such as borderline personality or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma are also common.
Surprisingly, the brain of a healthy person itself hallucinates under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, according to Casten, consist of the contents of thoughts that are normally repressed.
They arise when the parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or not suppressed enough; If our brain boils or when stimulation is missing.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like brain damage or psychosis.
But also withdrawal of stimuli, stress, worries about love or other exceptional states.
In more recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported that they had experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the local grammar school.
Actually a completely normal girl.
If it weren't for the patterns and voices.
During breaks, she may be approached by a wheelbarrow with long, dark hair.
When she answers him, her classmates look at her with surprise - no one but her can see and hear this boy.
This shy girl thinks she's a stiff dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows that.
He is awake, he hears and sees the boy, just as he hears and sees the girl sitting next to him in the pew.
She can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, he sometimes asks.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the apparitions are rather daunting
Often delusions are a burden.
When she sits in class, she cannot watch the lessons many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is introducing a new classmate, while he explains to everyone else audibly and visibly on the blackboard mathematical equations.
At night, the apparitions are rather daunting.
When she waits in her dark room for a sleep that rarely comes too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already asleep, whether the images she sees, the grimaces, or the girl with bleeding cuts on her hands and feet, appear before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, they shout at the characters.
She doesn't tell her parents and friends about it, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She graduated from high school last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted the psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows exactly that she has not gone mad.
Delusions are also an art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or stimuli are taken away, they are more likely to hallucinate, Kasten says.
I believe that the brain then does not have enough work and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she called Dad since she was thinking wasn't her own father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations involve the same brain regions that process real sensations and sounds, it is difficult for people like Sarah K. to distinguish between delusions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, reality is also displayed there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain creates, which is why it feels so real."
Night dreams are also evaluated by Kasten as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten advises his patients to rate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Borderline state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our world too conscious, imaginary experience is mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinic at the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, agonizing disease, but it also brings positives, creativity - a mirage is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard investigated the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of altered consciousness to dreams.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams that the person considers real and cannot even distinguish retrospectively from the waking state.
Oneiroid state of consciousness arises in extreme situations caused by trauma or illness, for example, polyradicular inflammation patients who experience motor paralysis while fully conscious.
When a person is threatened with the loss of the world and himself, even by a persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces life-threatening real situations with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of borderline state between a dream and a hallucination.
Because it is not possible to manage a situation in reality, the worlds change, but the real situation becomes present in the imagination.
An intense form of sensory support and sensory transfer in some unbearable situation that allows us humans to transform ourselves into loss of consciousness in an instant.
Everything is real, even later in memories
The art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (The Exchange of the Heart) as a rescue action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, after heart valve surgery followed by a heart transplant, his consciousness embarked on a journey of several days, with his body lying motionless in intensive care.
Claussen immerses himself in the world he has created, visiting strange times and places: He becomes an old man bedridden, in a train sanatorium, a robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobility, which produces narcotics from blood.
A Greek kidnaps him on a motorcycle to his homeland, surfs a firn in the Alps in a hospital bed and meets a Korean mafioso.
He immerses himself completely in an imaginary plot, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Claussen, these inner paths are fundamentally different from any dream.
A dream is a different state, it describes its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of those mental journeys are still clearly clear years later and in insignificant details.
Even clearer and more intense than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, oneiroid states, psychoses, hallucinations and drug intoxications show how fragile our inner images of external reality are even in the waking state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
A fact that can also be enriching.
Snow can come
Burda
At 27, children are to take over the publishing house
The new head of Kallen is a temporary solution: Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to his two children in the long term, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding should continue to belong 100 percent to the family.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the hands of his children for a long time.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and have a strong will to join the company, says the 69-year-old man of SPIEGEL.
We have dealt with the details carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is asked afterwards.
Even the question of whether they have the ability to do so.
It is not possible to put your children at the head of 7500 employees if they are not capable enough.
This would kill both the children and the business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he was withdrawing from the board of directors from January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the board of directors of Burda since 1999.
At first, he was in charge of technology.
Later, the Treasury section was joined by responsibility for the company's assets and, after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer, also by Direct Marketing, Foreign Marketing, Press and Finance.
For the first time, the publishing house is not headed by a member of the family.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, and his son Felix, who would have been 42 today, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years," Burda said.
The holding should continue to belong 100 percent to the family in the future, Burda says.
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses are not certain of extinction: "It has always affected companies that have allowed themselves to be infected by the desire for capital, that speculated and thought they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had "dreams of world power," Burda said.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country like Springer was, and I don't want to play in the world league with "Time", these deals are too big.
Comprehensive beauty care
Everything you could wish for in terms of beauty and well-being is at your fingertips.
This is the intention of El Corte Inglés, which has just launched the Callao (Madrid) shopping centre with an area of more than 1000 m2, which provides a variety of body care services.

Christmas is approaching and this is the time when it is convenient to find out what celebrities wear and adapt their festive wardrobe accordingly.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the figure, which is necessary to keep in mind.
Here are some suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut. Isn't recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The energy company Endesa together with the Barcelona City Hall set up the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project for the development and promotion of an electric car in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE' office (Logistics for the Introduction of Electric Vehicles) will define and manage the road plan for the introduction of electric vehicles in the city and will arrange mobility agreements, handle, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric cars, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
All in all, the purpose is to promote this means of transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city to join the EV launch project in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will also join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government under the MOVE Plan to support the introduction of electric vehicles.
Energy company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The purpose is to support RTD activities in the autonomous region of Catalonia.
This includes activities related to energy and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative with Endesa's participation in promoting electric vehicles.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and is actively implementing a number of additional projects, e.g. G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero foresees a 'lull period' for the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that Spain's car industry, the state's main export industry, is facing a "quiet period."
In the Prime Minister's economic report for 2009, Zapatero summarised the measures introduced during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Competitive Plan for the automotive sector, we would face a state of abandonment today, the closure of some of our main manufacturing enterprises," the prime minister said.
"Thanks to this plan and the desire of the individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, we anticipate a period of calm in the future, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this sense, he noted that the competing plan, which forms part of the Integral Plan of the Automotive Sector (PIA), earmarked EUR 800 million for projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilised an investment of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernization of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also highlighted the government's measures to support the requirement, mentioning Plan 2000E, which is being implemented in cooperation with autonomous regions and car brands.
According to the president, the plan made it possible to reduce by 6 percent the average emission level of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and ensured a "significant increase" in registrations, namely in November by "40 percent".
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first International Salon of Classic Vehicles will open in Madrid, a meeting place for professionals and amateurs from the world of engines.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of Madrid's Casa de Campo.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, where more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but also in ClassicAuto Madrid there will be products of all types related to the world of engines.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real delicacies for collectors and the curious.
Among the participating firms will be the following:Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and renewal of automobiles; or Cochera Clásicos, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Exterior proficiency tests
In addition, the commercial activities of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: holding training camps, sports performances, aptitude tests, presentations and auditions.
Proficiency tests will also be carried out on classic cars and motorcycles in an adapted circuit outside the exhibition zone.
Mazda3 i-Stop: maintaining sporty style
Mazda intends to show that environmental friendliness has no negative impact on sportiness.
That's why the Mazda3 has a built-in engine stop and start system – also christened i-Stop-, a device currently only available with the 2.0-litre 150-horsepower petrol engine.
This second generation Mazda3 is distinguished by the good characteristics that it has achieved as a whole.
Finish, vehicle design, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver's seat, have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely soft.
Using the tool lineup and console, we conclude that Mazda continues the Japanese trend in developing a futuristic design with many buttons and controls, and a bold red and blue colors.
This style partly reminds us of the style also presented by the Honda Civic.
Thus, we can say that the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products and, more specifically, with the Volkswagen Golf that everyone wants to beat.
As is usual, this Japanese compact product provides more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, it is worth mentioning the large luggage compartment and regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system is currently only available with a two-liter gasoline engine with 150 horsepower and a six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real treat. It is very gentle, characterized by a reduced noise level, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most sought-after Mazda3 is in a diesel version, all those who do not drive as many kilometers per year should not rule out this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, as it is characterized by greater driving comfort and reduced consumption.
In terms of equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of production features.
For the standard equipment, the lane monitoring system (RVM) is to prevent blind spots, thrust and stability control, speed control, light-sensitive interior mirror, on-board computer with large screen, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain and light sensor, Bluetooth and Bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
And if the equipment was not enough, this version was equipped withPack Premium, for an additional fee of 1.500 euros: adaptive lights dual-xenon and a BOSE sound system with CD holder, among other components.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its category.
It is characterized primarily by the quality of the materials used, its operation and a high level of equipment.
What's more, people who don't drive more kilometres per year can opt for this i-Stop version, which comes with a 2.0 petrol engine and 150 hp only.
The only drawback of this model is its higher price, which is 21.770 euros for the Luxury version and 23.270 euros for the tested version -Sportive-.
For this high price, the Mazda3 offers us a great deal of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'premiere'

Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose a dark 'lady'.
FonPeek Promise
Peek is extremely limited, used only for viewing mail, without the ability to view a certain type of attachments or surf the net.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
It's harder to see it outside, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount that is paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began offering two new devices: one exclusively for Twitter, the other based on a permanently provided free data service, for which you have to pay six times the amount for Peek.
FonPeek, which was presented yesterday at Le Web, is the European version of the invention and its third transformation.
It is as limited as its American counterpart, but it brings surprises.
The monthly maintenance fee is about €12 per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People travelling with a smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing a border or impatiently looking for a café with WiFi (or Fon connection) to check their mail.
The idea of fixed-price rooming is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, one would need a doctorate in physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to be able to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly calling for roaming tariffs to be reduced to make them accessible throughout Europe, which is still not having the desired effect.
There is a well-founded fear of using data services outside the home country.
The fact that a device like FonPeek (interestingly, it continues to have the name Fon when it does not have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators are starting to think differently and are considering different offers to compensate their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering book downloads and other Internet searches.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and pays at the time of purchase, not monthly.
And this is exactly what I expect to happen one day in the case of FonPeek, it is an option to purchase with permanent access as that Peek already has in place in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it is the best type from a consumer point of view.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on a computer.
The color Michelle loves
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first lady of the USA.
She chose a dress and coat in this color for Barack Obama's presidency, the same color she chose when she accompanied him to the second most important moment of his life: the presentation of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: apart from being a similar color - yellow-green with shimmering effects - both were three-piece ensembles - dress, bag and coat of the same fabric - decorated with large embroidery or collar.
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the USA decided to follow in the footsteps of the Asturian princess and wear similar clothes.
The fabric from which the clothes are made makes the two models quite different.
On the occasion of taking office, Michelle used large lace, in Oslo velvet with print.
They also change accessories: green shoes with a medium-high heel, nowa similar model, but in gold color.
She also wears different hairstyles: this time, previously loose hair.
75% of working mothers have work problems related to motherhood.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially among younger women wishing to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'Fertility and working career of Spanish women', carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The study involved 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75, and the results are unequivocal: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities on the labour market due to motherhood.
The study highlights that at the beginning of cohabitation, there are many differences of opinion on the number of children, depending on whether they work or not, and also according to the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job start living with a partner earlier, give birth to their first child earlier and have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable jobs, especially in the public sector, postpone cohabitation and motherhood and have fewer children.
"Women aged 35 to 49 with stable employment have their first child on average 3.7 years after the beginning of cohabitation with their partner. This figure is 4.1 for women who have devoted most of their lives to achieving stable employment and have therefore had to postpone cohabitation and the arrival of children.
The type of profession also has a strong influence on motherhood, although less influence on the time it takes to start living with a partner," explains Margarita Delgado, who researches at CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of marriage andthe birth of a child is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which women marry and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child at the age of 25.1 and 32.1, respectively.
"There is yet another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with primary education marry and give birth to their first child before finding stable employment, while women with secondary or higher education do the opposite: they prefer to get a stable job rather than get married and have their first child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of female actors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal motto 'Because I am worth it'.
'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses of international standard, joins other famous personalities of L'Oréal Paris such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
Before her, actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millionaire') joined this select club.
The men's section of this cosmetics brand is also represented by prominent personalities: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in fashion matters.
Their most prominent representatives - designers and models, past and present - met at the annual awards ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one was absent from the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted best model of the year.
Manuel Vicente's Poker
In 'Ace Poker' (Alfaguara, illustrated by Fernando Vicente), Manuel Vicent donates thirty X-ray images of writers he has met in his literary life (and in some cases in everyday life).
It does not do so in feared and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but seeks something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The journey brings excitement and Vicent is not sparing in shock or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reading experience, even when re-read.
Here are some observations.
Of Albert Camus: "In the pages of this book I discovered that the Mediterranean is not the sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be named: the enjoyment of the counter-fate, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god."
Of Samuel Beckett: "The nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not his intellect, something between helplessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humor, meaningless, as if it were the blade of a knife that nearly killed him."
Of Graham Greene: "Our man has been shrouded in passion for this woman for thirteen years, adultery, pleasure, and remorse, which is a spiritual privilege for reaching heaven by the way of damnation."
Of James Joyce: "This Odyssey was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight-thousander peaks in universal literature, which must be overcome from the north side, from which the best climbers often fall."
On William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
Of himself, he said of himself that he was the heir of a landlord from the county, sometimes that he was the son of a negro woman with a crocodile.
Both were grand dreams."
Of Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught on the bridge the demented cry of this man from Munich to carry his echo into the night of the XXth century in his literary form, running away from himself and crying out to the future and speaking violently to the worms."
Of Dorothy Parker, "She once knelt down and prayed, 'My God, my beloved, make me stop writing as a woman.'
Of Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved Spenser's verses: 'After effort comes a dream,/ After a storm a quiet harbor,/After a war rest,/After a full life death.'
On Virginia Wolf: "He also carried his depression in his luggage.
Her husband fully agreed to let her tell him that Edward VII had followed her among the azaleas, or that the birds had sung in Greek.
Never before has a man been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness."
On Pío Baroja: "What was Martín Santos up to but focus Joyce on Baroya?
What else did Benet care about than having Baroja executed with Faulkner's gun?
What was Cel's concern but to make himself famous at the expense of the man's fame?"
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my seventy-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood, in the Fuenlabrada district, and a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed by and our dog, a mongrel rescued from a shelter weighing up to six kilograms, was kicked twice and seriously injured without saying a word.
Our indignation is all the greater because we do not see anything amusing in such aggression towards a small and defenseless animal, which, moreover, was on a leash.
And the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she encountered these individuals on a walk, she began to fear for her own safety, because such a devil-possessed person, who attacks an animal, is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old person, or anyone weaker than himself.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, on Tuesday, in the usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day.
Of course, we have lodged a complaint with the nearest commissariat, but we doubt that it was of any use and, in order not to raise delicate questions, we note that these cowardly murderers were of Spanish nationality.
Outrage prompted us to announce this fact.
We do not understand what happens to today's youth when they entertain themselves by tormenting a defenseless animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We do not understand where the right upbringing, respect for animals and people, has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helmets
Tire manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Traffic Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially among younger motorists, as both companies reported today.
The purpose of this initiative is to highlight the importance of wearing a helmet, as it is the only means of preventing head injuries and even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin states that this campaign forms part of its commitment to traffic safety, which "means more than designing and manufacturing even safer products", and confirmed that it is trying to fulfil this purpose in other ways, i.e. through an information and information campaign.
This new campaign to promote helmet use while riding motorcycles, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', is the first phase where notices will be placed in more than 500 motorcycle repair shops to bring it to the attention of the general public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that traffic safety "is a constant problem" of the company, which is a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles and whose main objective is to continuously improve product safety.
Sales of light commercial vehicles increase
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market is starting to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represented an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, what's more, this is the first increase after 22 months of steady decline, according to figures from the patronage organization of manufacturers Anfac and dealers Ganvam.
However, it is better to quarantine the favourable figure, as November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison and meant a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase over the past month, the total number of vehicles registered over the past 11 months is 40% less than in the previous accounting year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling into the category of light commercial vehicles: derivatives of passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, smaller trucks and light trucks/chassis.
And the gloom that hurts demand the most has not disappeared either, even if they were bought by private individuals, most purchases were made by small and medium-sized companies, and almost 100% of the cases are financed by third parties.
In addition to the constraints resulting from the closure of the source of bank credit, other factors such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of the bad economic situation must be added.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, the support for the purchase of the 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private individuals, it is also necessary to mention persons doing business on a trade license small and medium-sized companies that intend to purchase a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday from Ganvam they reminded once again that special attention needs to be paid to the management of these vehicles and also industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers' association expects that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and, according to calculations, sales of passenger cars and 4x4 will fall by 19%.
The handbrake assistance system is already a mandatory equipment.
As in the case of the anti-lock braking system ABS, it will be with ESP stability control, auxiliary handbrake systems, all this will become mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, it is already part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the others the deadline for closing the shortage is February 2011.
The measure introduced in the EU aims to increase pedestrian protection and works in such a way that it can help avoid many collisions.
The handbrake assist system increases the brake pressure in an emergency, which the system detects when the driver presses.
But he is not always able to keep this pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by auto parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of drivers who have an accident did not apply the brakes before the collision, and half of them did not fully use the force of the brake.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires maximum from the braking system, shortening the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of device, up to 1 100 pedestrian-related fatalities per year could be avoided.
The reduction in this number will be even more striking – according to calculations, one in four accidents affecting people would be avoided – following the introduction of so-called intelligent handbrake systems.
In this case, the vehicle will be equipped with a system that (using radar or camera) detects obstacles and reports them to the driver, in addition to light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help him increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even if the collision cannot be avoided, the device will act as intensely as possible on the brake, reducing the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, told Opel employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April — likely April 8 — as reported by Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will need more time to meet the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to get every point of the plan agreed with the party concerned.
As a result, the final document, which will first be submitted to employees and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production plants are located, may be issued belatedly at the beginning of 2010.
GM, on the other hand, assures that the decision to sell Saab should be taken in these days.
Not surprisingly, the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM allows contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also wants to acquire Volvo but is considering Dutch sports car maker Skyper, which operates under the auspices of Russia's Converg group.
If no deal can be reached with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab's assets to China's Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year remains in place if it is not sold.
Driving the Porsche Boxster Spyder
When developing this magnificent model, Porsche engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, so the weight shows only 1,275 kg.
On the basis was, first of all, the automatic retractable roof is in a canvas design with manual control, reducing the weight by 21 kg; aluminum doors such as the GT3 were also used, which means an additional 15 kg less; removal of air conditioning, 13; The reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to a weight reduction of an additional 7 kg; After fitting the sports seats an additional 12 kg,thanks to the lightweight 19-inch wheelsan additional five kilos.
Finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less, and replacing the door handles with textile handles means an extra kilogram.
Also available with a PDK dual-clutch transmission, one vehicle with a manual six-speed gearbox was tested, mainly on second-class roads in California, on mountain sections with many convoluted bends.
His conduct can only be classified as untouchable.
Reducing weight does not mean that the vehicle does not press against the asphalt.
Quite the opposite: it has been a long time since we have tested such a small and light model that would also transmit such safety when cornering, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete able to warm up his muscles during a short ride for the necessary time until we order him to sprint, brake, and resume use of the engine...
Whatever we want. With steering that is as communicative as it is precise, whatever we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car does.
And he will do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of the V6 boxer, with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced by the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine previously used in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether during suction or recuperation.
The curtains are solid, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we drive through with the Boxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car coped well with potholes.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; And yet in some corners we encountered icy and gravel at dawn even in the late morning.
Definitely, this ultra-light car is one of the most fun on the market, as it is little more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 at a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Karl Lagerfeld's girlfriend, Coco Cocoon icon and occasional 'starlette' at 'company' shows, the singer shows off her evil girl face as vehemently as her Chanel handbags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia wins in Israel
The Treasury won brilliantly in 82-91 on loan at the complicated Maccabi Electra pitch, despite numerous absences from Duska Ivanovic, and thus moved to the top of their group after a great performance by Mirza Teletovic, who was named the best in the squad with eight triple points (29 ratings).
The Vitoria squad was able to compensate for the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great deal of commitment and collective work, although they had to suffer until the end to win the title.
In addition, the great accuracy of the circuit with 16 triple points contributed a lot to the final triumph.
The match started facing the blues, who stood on the mark from the start.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from distance already indicated that they attacked the Israeli team very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the leading scorers 18-20 at the end of the first period.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alava team opted for the inside play of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, who was received by whistles and applause on his return to his original place to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to show himself to be the best in his squad with 13 points, although 'without six' in Splitter's evaluation already indicated that it would not be the best evening for the Brazilian.
But although the match was fierce until the break, it was not decided in the slightest, and the Maccabeus wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone wins on their pitch, and 'by the hand of Elias' they managed to win.
Eidson and Pnini certainly contributed to bringing the 'yellows' back to prominence (50-49).
More inappropriate
The Ivanovic members, injured but not dead at all, needed some accurate play to catch their breath, and then Mirza Teletovic's machine gun appeared, which with three triple almost consecutive and with the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a calming number (54-67), which the locals achieved at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alava team scraped their skin in the last leg and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow anyone to deprive them of the deserved results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter sent off for a foul, Ivanovic did not rush and defended well, and although the Israelis came close in the final minute (80-85), the match already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in the season.
Injuries make it impossible for Unicaja to fight
Unicaja lost significantly to Olympiacos in Greece and gave them the lead of Group B in the Euroleague in a match that was marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but above all by internal play (Freeland, Lima and Archibald) that facilitated the Greek victory.
Malaga's squad was not intimidated by the environment of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or an opponent, perhaps one of the sicker in Europe, and with a big budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. Aggressive defence and three consecutive triple points, two thanks to Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, lit up the pitch with 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity, although the arsenal of locals in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score around 22-20, minute 13, a moment when a brawl between USABeverley and Williams mainstays meant both players were sent off.
The Greek squad started to operate and proved their superiority in both zones, where the absence of the England pivot due to injury to Joel Freeland and three personal errors by Carlos Jiménez burdened Unicaja
Between the inside players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas with triple points, they increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible retaliation
The third part was very attacking on the part of Olympiacos, who, despite losing by 19, showed superiority and even managed to equalize the difference from the match in Malaga Málaga 66-48, minute 27, which shook the lead in the group.
Unicaja struggled to overcome the absences and final absences of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the drawbacks, Unicaja, thanks to Cook's lead and triple points and Lewis' contribution, left some hope for a 66-57 win, 31 minutes.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympiacos, thanks to the reinforcement and superiority in centimeters in his zone, proved that he is unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic equalized the basket average of 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja wilted and handed over the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you earn for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can get to know the salary they deserve for their profile thanks to the new Trovit app, the search engine with the most sorted real estate, employment and motor vehicle ads in Spain.

During the week that the app has been operating, the search engine has found that a Spanish worker generally "feels badly rewarded," explained Albert Rivera, responsible for the Trovit product, in his report.
According to data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
A British programmer earns 45,226 euros gross per year and a French 31,059, while a Spaniard receives 24,000.
Similarly, the driver has a salary of 34,247 euros net per year in England, 25,751 euros in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is a waiter's job with 11,592 euros net per year; The shop assistant follows with €14,725 and the worker with €15,667.
The most searched online jobs over the past three months are driver, part-time and social worker.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to remain at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic mission no later than January 27, 2010, when his mandate officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he has to leave the embassy where he has been hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that on January 27, after the end of his mandate, he must leave and seek another refuge."
The station also quoted a former statesman as confirming his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, that same week he tried to gain refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed because Zelaya refused the condition of political asylum, which the government "de facto", chaired by Roberto Micheletti, tried to impose on him.
Thank you
After days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation was the dominant mood in the markets, uncertainty has reappeared in the markets, which should not be surprising as this is already a natural state of affairs in an environment where executives take decisions about a future that is itself uncertain.
The drug used by central banks to stabilize the market was to monetize debt through outright asset purchases and indirect liquidity relief at rates close to zero so that financial institutions could purchase assets for deduction.
Central banks have already confirmed that outright asset purchases have virtually ended, and without questioning their disparate liquidity policies, they are starting to throw some sand into the gears, as the Bank of Spain did with its auction last year.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to sustain an economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are participating in a return to reducing risk returns.
The volatility of the stock exchange and the bond differences of the companies have regained points, although they are still far from the abnormal level they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected public debt.
Once again, the pressure on quality is being sought, and the US, Japan and Germany have become the havens chosen by investors, widening the differentiation of eurozone countries vis-à-vis Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came along and threatened a new revision of the downskilling of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty is not useless in silencing the advocates of moral hazard, who have once again sought to burden the consciences of those responsible for world economic policy in order to put the brakes on the devastating effects of credit cuts on employment, when in fact a new day of Thanksgiving would have to be declared.
However, the situation in Dubai represents tribal struggles between the emirs to restore power in the Emirates, and as for Greece, we have seen this before.
A government that covers up the deficit, elections and a new government comes in.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro member country to default on its obligations.
What makes sense, however, is for Ecofin to force the Greek Government to be transparent and to hold its own citizens jointly accountable when extraordinary measures are necessary to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are facing a period of normalisation of temporary risk premiums, after some excesses in supported positions, they would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase like the bonds of European companies, we need not worry.
If Europe's differences narrow and ours continue to widen, this would be a typically Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's affair is just an anecdote. When our leading indicators force most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their upside scenario for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, this does not bode well for the Spanish economy to live to see this warning fulfilled.
Again, it looks like this will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, albeit "cautious, driver's buddy" for now.

President Iberdrola Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene yesterday before a subcommittee of the Chamber of Deputies, where Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades is currently being discussed.
After his intervention, which was followed by a speech by Gas Natural-Fenosa President Rafael Villaseca, Galán provided the press with some remarks about the proposal he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of 50,000 million euros by 2020 and another 60,000 million between that date and 2030 if the nuclear power plants currently in operation are maintained.
If this does not happen, the necessary investment will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that over the next decade, investment must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international interconnections
From 2020, the issue is changing and performance will need to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal-fired power plants with carbon capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, he believes that a new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other 'supporting energies'.
Galán, who believes that the draft sustainable economy law just passed by the government corresponds to the line demanded by the company, did not want to bleed like a royal decree to promote the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policy of combating climate change.
In his opinion, there is a "clear long-term bet"in this sense, despite the "precise" measures, as President Iberdrola called them.
Be that as it may, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term ones, must be taken now, because they take time to mature and a stable tax framework is needed for their initiation.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus 'handling' at ten airports
Ferrovial's airport ground services subsidiary, Swiss Swissport, will play the role of Irish airline Aer Lingus's preferred partner for cargo services at the ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, which has not yet revealed economic terms, is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a protocol of cooperation on the creation of a Smart Infrastructure Innovation Centre
The association expects to invest 20 million by 2012, of which 50% is accounted for by Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to research energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona seeks its first motorway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first motorway concession in Australia, a market where it already operates as an energy and water business.
The construction in question is a tunnel estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
Its rivals are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
The 5-kilometre-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast has become the closest option for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction and concession highway company.
The town hall wishes to have the tunnel completed by the end of 2014
After selecting public-private cooperation (PPP according to the initials in English) for further development of the project in the business plan sponsored by Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the implementation of the construction and operation of the toll.
Bids are expected to be submitted in May, with an expected investment of AUD 1,700 million (€1,047 million) and three concerns with a significant presence in European construction are competing in the final phase.
The group, called Transcity, is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest construction companies, and the second, based in Italy, is one of Europe's largest underground construction specialists.
Acciona is opposed by Northern Direct with the presence of Britain's Laing O'Rourke, Australia's Transfield infrastructure manager and French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last concern that passed through the sieve is called LBRJV and involves the Australian capital Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, represented here by ACS), as well as the local Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and an important company specializing in civil construction Razel.
Australia's infrastructure market promises big construction and privatisations, but it makes it difficult to enter other than through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
The strategy followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger is, in addition to Asian references, still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS acquired market position through its 30 % stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Million Dollar Assets
Acciona relies on the geographical area of greatest importance to the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its activities as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, he has the largest wind farm in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and leads a group of companies that build and manage a desalination plant in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan now is to consolidate these two areas and use the combined energy to enter the areas of construction and operation of infrastructure.
The toll underground road, promoted by the Brisbane Infrastructure Authority, called Northern Link, is intended to connect the western motorway from Toowong with the 5km circular route at Kelvin Grove (see map). This is Brisbane's largest congestion reduction event.
The calendar set by the local government plans the assignment for the summer of 2010 and the start of work for December next year.
Although this paid passage would open in the last months of 2014, the full completion of the work is planned for 2016.
The design of the tunnel began in 2005.
It will include two streams in each direction, an electronic toll system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (€308 million) to fund it.
Brisbane has already offered this contract to Hochtief
Australia continues to bring significant profits to Hochtief, having yesterday announced a contract with the government estimated at $154 million.
The shareholder ACS will operate the national broadband network infrastructure with fibre optic cable through its local Leighton subsidiary.
This situation will allow fast access to the Internet for 400,000 people and provide the German company with a job for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company abandoned the project to build a 27-storey King George tower in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work was yet to begin and Hochtief closed the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will be involved with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC was allocated a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has been awarded €64.5 million for a 2.1-kilometre tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia.
The company was awarded the contract a few days after the completion of work on the extension of the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
Work is scheduled to start in early 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore Gets Advertised in Renfe
Renfe has assigned advertising and marketing services to SRA for the past two years. Rushmore for about three million euros a year, the railway company said.
The contract includes the possibility of an extension of 12 months each year. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies to compete in Renfe, of which four advanced to the finals, including TBWA, which has been responsible for creating ads for the past three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore take care of designing and producing campaigns.
Fine of EUR 63 million for France Télécom for hampering competition
The competition regulator in France fined lFrance Télécom €63 million for anti-competitive conduct in the country's Caribbean regions.
According to the institution, the operator reduced competition from fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs with marginalized consumers.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for putting obstacles in the way of its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday has de facto been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed an offence similar to that of the past and that there has therefore been a recidivism.
App Store
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened an app store on the Internet with the aim of increasing revenues that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the beginning, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries such as Spain.
Playing in the Champions League has brought Madrid and Barça 476.4 million since the start
The Champions League has become a source of income for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since earned 476.4 million, making them the third and fifth most profitable clubs in the competition.
The list is led by Manchester United.
The list is led by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League doesn't just bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
So much so that the competition distributed 5.362.5 million euros among the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) that have participated in the event since the tournament's inception in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The White Club was third on the continent with the most money it raised for participation, and the only one, along with AC Milan, to win the Grand Prix three times.
The current Catalan champion and the last winner of the defunct European Cup in 1992 is fifth in the classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also charged the most money for participating in the last Champions League.
And this despite losing both to Barça.
Spain, on the other hand, is only the third country to raise the most money through the Champions, despite winning the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for distributing the money used by UEFA.
For this financial year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to earn 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA dedicates 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary classification round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who achieved participation received 3.8 million just for their presence, in addition to an additional 550,000 euros for each match they attend.
There is also a bonus for a win (800,000 euros) and for a draw (400,000 for each team). The eight finalists will receive three million each; eight quarter-finalists3.3 million.
Each of the last four will get 4 million.
The champion earns 9 million, while the second finalist earns 5.2 million.
In this way, the club will earn a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça earned 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are floating payments, for which 337.8 million are earmarked.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main and has four assigned places.
Last year's champion will receive 40% of the money allocated, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will be played this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% Sos
Yesterday, Nueva Rumasa Group released details of a share purchase offer to take a top spot between 25% and 29.9% of SOS's capital.
This percentage does not oblige to make a public offer for the acquisition (option) of all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa is offering €1.5025 per share, which it would pay in ten years and for which it would pay interest on this deferral of 1% per annum.
Yesterday, Sos shares ended trading at 1.85 euros; therefore, Nueva Rumasa rates the company 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of the Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 board members.
The Jerez Group provides a period of 15 days for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the shares.
CNMV said it had not been informed of the bid, although Ruiz Mateos' company confirmed it had contacted the regulator.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to change its leadership structure.
In an attempt to remain on the sidelines of possible buy-and-trade bids and settle the judicial swings of its former leaders, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, the election of María Luisa Jordá as head of internal audit was announced.
This decision makes her the first woman to occupy a high-ranking position in a food business.
It is a newly created post that will report directly to the president of the group.
And it is not exempt from controversy, as the company remains mired in a legal battle over the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from Sos to the Salazar brothers' companies.
In fact, it is impossible to discard the possibility that SOS will reveal new fund transfers in the coming months
As for the Salazars' credit, former council members Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) testified before the National Court yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of EUR 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV authorizes option to exclude Paternina, in which Inversora Mer participated
Yesterday, the National Securities Commission (CNMV) allowed the expulsion of Inversor Mer against Federico Paternino9. October.
The supervisory authority explained that it authorised the operation because it understood that its conditions were in line with the applicable standards and considered that the content of the explanatory brochure submitted following the amendments introduced on 2 December was 'sufficient'.
The CNMV stated that the offer is aimed at acquiring 550,008 shares of Federico Paterina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95% of the company's capital, which consists of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been immobilized and could not be transferred in any way until the bid was concluded, specifying that the price had been set by Federico Paternina according to the provisions of the applicable standards.
New automotive pricing tools
These days of storms and accidents, not only car repair shops are earning.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered an insured event are towed to the workshop, where an expert must estimate the damage and repair costs.
No claim is the same, and calculating parts costs and labor time can be a long and complex job.
Manually calculating repair costs from €20,000 to €30,000, including parts and manpower, can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of connoisseurs use this kind of system.
Suppliers of claims and maintenance estimation and solutions are dedicated to collecting the information provided to them by manufacturers in order to develop and offer a useful tool to their customers.
In Spain Audatex, of the American group Solera is the leading company; 80% of the ratings are done with its products.
Other firms competing in the field of valuation tools and the development of sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales director of Audatex, they work with 63 manufacturers and importers in Spain, each providing them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to grow, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been introduced in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as the new vehicle enters the market, these businesses start working.
This is a very frantic job, because each of the thousands of parts of a vehicle has to be catalogued and priced.
In addition, each model has an "intelligent" graphic design, where it is possible to "pinpoint" the individual parts of the tourist cars.
As for the model with massive sales, the work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
As for a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models they have information about is Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
Regarding the mobile park in circulation, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the work of documenting and developing databases, Audatex has eight centers divided around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanics experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros a year in the development of these databases.
2.5 million pieces of data are filed each month and customers receive updates every two days.
Processing this immense stream of information allows businesses to use and provide different products.
The most common applications are concentrated on repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools to manage spare parts or to calculate the sales or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that provides information on the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer them in our country, but in the United States it does.
Considering the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get support that can be used by professionals in the sector.
The business offers ten different tools, with the star product being AudaPlus, the standard claims valuation solution for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or paint shop.
This tool is paid according to the use for each assessment.
The highest price is 5.75 euros for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
After that, each insurance company that makes thousands of estimates negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow full identification of the vehicle and the device with which it came off the assembly line based only on the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass, and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to discard vehicles with a total insurance claim.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying tendencies, carrying out geodemographic analyses or detecting deviations by make or model.
For example, it is possible to study how many modelsof a certain brand have undergone service due to an accident or how many have suffered serious insurance claims for a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of instrument.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also intended for connoisseurs and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices, and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group founded in 1971 as a supplier of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, accidents or car maintenance
Gt Guía Valuation is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 service users, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The volume of turnover increased by 20% per year over the last three years, and in 2008 they charged 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization began with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established itself in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its brother originates in Europe and 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, of which 3,000 in Spain.
Solera Group's global invoicing (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, up 3.3% from 2008.
In our country, the company earns 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1,000 million on the stock exchange, and now its shares are estimated to total at $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Internet auction of crashed vehicles
Last October, the Solera Group bought Autoonline, an internet base for selling cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance claim.
The operation envisaged the subscription of 59.5 million euros of the company's 85% capital, which could be expanded by the remaining 15% next year.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more value-added services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This valuation and purchase and sales service is exclusively guaranteed to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, spare parts sales and professional dealers, who must register before starting operations.
The platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
Among the main markets, Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey stand out.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered dealers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily listings and about 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been retired cannot return to service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with historical value may be allowed to operate, even if they have been scrapped, after preliminary driving.
Service budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller, Audatex guarantees that the user receives a budget in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, finding a spare part, creating a budget and generating a budget.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially for persuading older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, tend to be reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, of which tourist 666, 109 off-road, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, for use you need a computer with an Internet connection.
After identifying the model to be repaired using the chassis number, a real graphical representation of the model will appear, and then the necessary spare part will be selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges, or discounts, and then print and hand it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not include an estimate of the workforce.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
Audatex is currently working to make these representations three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to show the inside.
