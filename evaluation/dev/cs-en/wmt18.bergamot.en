The Movement for Civil Rights issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colour People (NAACP) has published a warning to colored people travelling to Missouri on the basis of the state's discriminatory principles and racist attacks.
"The TFF to the Missouri State Recommendation, effective from 28 August 2017, calls on Missouri's African-American travellers, visitors and residents of the Missouri to take increased attention when travelling across the state as a result of a series of disputed racially motivated incidents currently taking place across the state," the association's statement reads.
The NAACP said it had taken this step on the basis of the current Missouri State Laws, which make it difficult to defend racially motivated acts in court, as well as as the conduct of law enforcement authorities that disproportionately target minorities.
"There are violations of civil rights.
People are stopped by police officers only because of their skin color, being attacked or killed," NAACP president for Missouri Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
"We'll be stocking up the largest number of complaints yet."
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization for the US state.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racially motivated profanities directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a man of black from Tennessee.
Sanders died in contentious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling across the state and was taken into custody by police without charge of committing the crime.
The travel recommendation also highlights a recent statement by the Attorney's Office of the State's Office, Missouri, which states that black women drivers have a 75% higher chance of being stopped by the police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers of what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be prepared - they should bring with them money to pay the bail, or alert their relatives that they are going to travel by the state."
According to the FBI program's current reporting of hate crimes, there were a hundred cases of hate speech in Missouri in 2015, putting the state in the 16th place among all states.
The travel warning is also the answer to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult for the company to be sued for discrimination in the provision of accommodation or employment.
The U.S. Civil Liberty Association (ACLU) issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona after states passed an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people on the basis of a violation of the law that the ACLU says is intended to improve racial profiling.
Travel advice is usually issued by the State Department for Foreign Country, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family has no peace after 12 years!
The murdered one is model Sally Anne Bowman.
The Croydon-born girl was murdered in 2005 by Chef Mark Dixie, right at the restaurant she worked in, who inflicted stab wounds.
Both the victim and the killer were to have sex and smoke marijuana, then killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe and watched the meticulous forensics of the crime scene's examination.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced to a prison in 2008 for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He only admitted to assaulting the juvenile in court, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found the girl dead lying in the street.
After three years, he was convicted by the police.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend, Lewis Sprotson, were arguing on the fateful night.
The killer said, "He was really angry and the girl started screaming after his attack."
"It even attracted the attention of the taxi driver," he said falsely.
The girl, according to his testimony, should have resisted as much as she could, but to no avail.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie's version was proven to be a lie and accused him.
After the confession, Dixie spoke of his hornity and taste for the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to set a smoke for marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally, he was with his ex-girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking the cocaine, Dexie himself told the police.
He said he felt the adrenaline rush.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," Linda added.
And after twelve years, the family is facing further attacks from vandals destroying her grave.
He's been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are such cruel people on the loose who are digging up these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," the late girl's mother, Linda, told the Mirror about the disappearance of the ash urn.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Designer vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"The Czechs are not prudish or conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs the Intimity boutique in Prague.
In it you will find design and luxurious erotic devices.
Including those by Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started quietly, about 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went cycling around Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bicycle, but also a box full of unremarkably-looking vibrators.
"Different mole and dolphins and dolphins were all green and yellow and just completely different," he tells me over lunch.
His friend and one other associate decided to work with a German manufacturer of designer erotic devices Fun Factory, which intrigued Martin, so he offered to help out with marketing.
When the companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, he runs a boutique Intimity in Prague's Benedictská Street, where he sells erotic aids in the way that luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
And why would they not?
These are also design items.
Wait, wait, you're talking about this at lunch, you're telling yourself?
Come on, don't be such puritans!
It was the Berlin-based Fun Factory store, designed by acclaimed designer Karim Rashid, that served as inspiration for the Intimity boutique.
It was opened in 2010 and it was a very different concept of erotic trade than everyone here is used to.
No covered windows, all made in a beautiful, demure style, products displayed more like a perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka began to wonder how to accommodate the Prague store, where he should be and how he should be.
The name of Intimity was of appeal to both.
"It's connected to intimacy, after all, and it's gentle, you might say, tender," he says.
It was followed by the purchase of an internet domain and a search for a suitable space that went in parallel with the various interior visualizations.
In the end, the option prevailed, spreading the shop into the pleasure garden and the bedroom, which was dominated by the bed.
It was prepared for us by Dagmar Štěpánová from the FormaFatal studio.
We found the area in 2013.
At first, he didn't seem ideal, because he's not on the main street, but it suited the name of Intimity.
It's intimate.
It's in the alley next to the main one, so no one is eyeing the customers," says Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to do a business that would be different, with designer nice goods, in an environment where women who are mostly our customers felt comfortable.
And not to be ashamed of entering such a deal at all.
When I entered the Intimity boutique half an hour ago, the streets were empty.
Plus, I didn't even feel like I'd go to the erotic device store.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior I know from the fashion boutiques.
Even if there is only a female attendant in the store, the fact that women don't shy away from asking for help doesn't mean the male leg doesn't come here.
For the most part, gentlemen come here to shop for gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men usually can't guess the right size and choose more," smiles Martin at the frequent mistake.
Those are the preconceptions, the common clichés that women need some big aids, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith chooses, for example, an unnecessarily large vibrator.
Likewise, men choose mostly black lingerie, whereas the woman usually gravitates towards pink.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product aptly called Satisfyer.
It must be clear from the look on my face that I don't know which one is beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's kind of a cobbler's clitoris-free stimulator.
I have an adolescent need to chuckle with admiration for the serious tone with which I am given the interpretation.
It's like there's no laughing.
And it doesn't really booze.
It is at a good price and has the perfect user reference.
We didn't believe he'd be so well received.
This is some kind of revolutionary new.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator in the shape of a segous horse.
He took the view of women becoming more interested in the design of such products.
The second was the We-Vibe steam vibrator.
He completely broke the taboo that may persist for some men, and that he sees competition in the erotic aids.
"They make different options," he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
That's a favorite category.
In a love conjunction, a woman can have a control officer in her hand and determine the intensity of the vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain flop is the category of sticking vibrators.
At least for us.
Czech women, it seems, prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, even though they may only use it externally.
In Western Europe, especially with younger customers, it is very popular.
What about the men?
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
It would have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer the men," Martin muses.
"We have aids for them, too, but to a limited extent." The most sold is mainly a masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not look like an anatomical imitation of the vaginum, but "more like a shower gel or as an egg or a futuristic object.
It focuses a lot on functionality and experiences when used.
In Japan, things are very different.
It's astonishing in me.
I thought Japanese women were very fond of erotic aids, I object.
"That's the Internet reality," it's explained.
The mundane one is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more associated with being used by women.
They are perfectly normal for men in Japan, and they are taboo for women." Just out of curiosity - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimity boutique, sells worldwide, still accounts for about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs are not very prudent.
On the contrary, we are a fairly accommodating nation.
Certainly as opposed to countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
The store's typical client is between the ages of 35 and 50, and "she's already had some experience with sex life and some of her aids.
She's coming for something nice, of a better quality to complete her partner's life, or for herself." Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka take care of it in such a way that they are convinced by each product if it is perfectly functional.
We also don't want to go into specialties like bondage and latex, because we both have no space for that, and it doesn't really come here.
Such things could discourage the ones we're trying to target.
Which are people who have always been shy about going to the sex shop because they were afraid of something like that coming out at them.
A lot of the products on the shelves are really appealing.
It is also due to the selection of renowned brands.
Some of them even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever awarded was the aforementioned seahorse "and this triggered a change in the whole industry.
It began to abandon cheap materials and, on the contrary, work with wholesome, with other designs, different colours...
It is nice that the Czech is behind the design of some, the popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say that I was quite pleasantly surprised by how many people buy those design items Whoop.de.doo from Anna Marešová, even though they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go directly for the Venus balls by Anna Marešová.
She did a really huge piece of work by presenting exactly what we are trying to presenting in the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids can be done differently, nice, with a story.
Anna's story began as a school job.
Now it is a finished product, which is also produced in our country.
I wanted to be in control of the production process and I also wanted to know from what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Because it's not a large-scale production, but a small series, it's certainly more expensive than the big series.
I may be going up the tide a bit, but it seems important to me to maintain the development in the Czech Republic.
It could well be that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything," Anna, who agrees with Martin, later describes the situation to me that our company is becoming more and more open.
It is not met with a negative or negative attitude.
At most, people are said to be embarrassed.
"But they, too, will start to smile." Currently, Anna Marešová has a vibrator on offer, on which you can have a personal message, and this year she also plans her own lubricant.
In the next year, there should be more vibrating eggs and other novelties.
Borders of healthy sex
I'm interested in where the line of what's okay lies.
Is there anything Martin Ráž doesn't sell anymore?
It's so hard to define.
What comes normal to one of them may seem completely abnormal to another, so we are more likely to define ourselves by the range of branded manufacturers.
None of them go into any extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest demand they received?
Just in the week came an e-mail in which a lady was asking for a masturbation aid for her friend with a naturate twenty-eight centimeters long.
So we had to write to her that we didn't have that one, unfortunately.
There's still a question of whether we were made fun of," Martin says, looking at me with a suspicious look.
It also happens from time to time...
A blow for Karel Gott.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel Štědrý is battling a serious illness.
Karel Gott's best friend is battling a disease that steals people's memories.
"Yes, it is unfortunately true," the singer himself confirmed to the sad information.
I know about my illness and so far, given the circumstances, I'm pretty good at it.
"I take the medications that are supposed to slow down the child attacks of the disease," he added, thanking the loved ones for their support.
The entire extended family rallied to make his life easier for Karl.
Eva's wife tries to be at home as hard as she can, and to her dad's house on White Mountain, the daughters from his first marriage, Zuzana and Tereza, the old-timed son Karel said Karlas.
Generous, he had twice battled cancer and passed on his experience to the Nightingale to support him in his demanding treatment.
He's done with sixty chemo treatments.
He was able to return to work and on the tennis court and ski slopes.
"I have a foretold the astrologer for me to be here by the age of ninety," Karel told Bleska.
He's a fighter.
He's still eager to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the songs so I don't forget them," Karl admitted.
The same disease is now being fought at the institute by the actress Květa Fialová.
Do you have a Alzheimer's patient in your family?
Look at how to treat him.
The Chilean parliament has lifted the abortion ban, the law will be considered by the CPS.
In Chile, an absolute abortion ban is still in force, so it must not be done for medical reasons.
"I am sorry that the legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been arguing about in parliament for more than two years," complained socialist senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and is expected to receive a new president at the end of August, who is close to the opposition, according to AFP.
The law repealing the absolute ban on abortions, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was approved by the Senate 19. July.
The right-wing opposition then announced that it would challenge the law in court because it believed it violated the unborn child's right to life.
Members postponed the vote on the bill last month until it was unrecovered by a joint parliamentary commission.
On Wednesday, the motion was approved by the MPs, and after that the Senate did so again.
Under the new legislative amendment, it should stop criminal abortion of abortion in three cases: if a woman's life is at risk, if the fetus has no chance of survival, or if the pregnancy originated from rape.
Similar exceptions had existed in Chile since 1931, according to the Spanish newspaper El País, before the women were granted the right to vote there in 1949.
The absolute ban on abortions in 1989 was imposed by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before he left the presidency.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on abortions.
The others are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In Salvador, for example, there are now about 20 women behind bars serving up to 30-year prison sentences for abortion.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was a spontaneous abortion, which the court called a murder.
Is there anything sacred?
Trump's White House target now is the Statue of Liberty
The unmarbling sign of regime change is the criticism of the statues.
The Americans could tell about it as well as everyone else - see the carefully staged overthrow of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Bagdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of the Trump regime, surely knew what was coming up when, in a heated debate with a CNN reporter, Jim Acosta, on the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants, he set off with a symbolic axe on the Statue of Liberty.
It is fitting that Miller did not attack the statue as such.
For that, he would be lynched by a crowd of cruise ship owners and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its significance, specifically the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poet Emmy Lazarus was placed on the pedestal, until 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller reprimanded Acosta by saying, "I don't want to go down in history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that casts light on the world.
The poem that was placed on the base retrospectively, and to which you refer, is not part of it."
Miller is in fact right, but as he put it, this is not about history.
These are, above all, the startling words of Emma Lazarus, which resonate today - inviting them not only from immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest: "Let it come to me who's down, who's the poor who can barely breathe freely, who's a miserable worm in the middle of the full cities."
And it is in modern times that we can watch these "intest worms" on our screens better than ever.
Miller didn't try to criticize poetry - he wanted to make it clear that these people were not welcome in the US.
This conflict over the meaning of the statue is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict over the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, like her friends, who, after her death, had sought to set a plaque with a poem on the base of the statue, well knew she was embarking on a high political game.
The statue was intended to express a combination of the French and American Republican governments by representing the classic theme, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus has altered this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but has her own voice.
She also has a very different name: the mother of the exiles.
The combination of a poem with the idea of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wingers have long sought to a reverse on that meaning.
The renowned commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jana the Baptist on Trump's rise to power - argued in 2010 that Statue of Liberty did not actually invite anyone to the country, but represent an early neo-constructivismism, bringing the American flame to the backward world: "The Statue of Liberty is striding forward.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The march is not to illuminate the journey to the United States."
Surprisingly, Limbaugh is alluding to an important point.
The meaning of the sculpture depends on the point of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the point of view of an exhausted and damned passenger, who often arrives after a long and terrifying ocean cruise with hope in his heart a new land.
This is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance at a better life.
From this perspective, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And, of course, that's a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump will ever accept.
Their torch is not to illuminate the path, but to stir up the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black sings praise for Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle recalls the days when the British team had only two Scottish members
United Kingdom Athletics Federation director Neil Black said the strong sitter of 16 Scots in the World Cup team would be a "huge benefit for the team."
For the World Championships in London 2017, which starts on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes have been selected.
Black believes that "something special is happening" in Scotland, and British athletics could learn a lot from the Scots.
"We are trying to understand this and adapt to it - we will work on it," Black said.
"I've spoken to the people of the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
Scottish athletics officials think it has to do with what they've done.
British athletics: it has to do with what they did.
People on the streets think so, too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will be vying for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butcharto - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m race, while Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the team.
"The Elilh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," Black said.
"Several athletes, whether Scots or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room with a sense of tremendous pride and motivation.
The passion and undisguised sensations Eilidh was talking to were unrepeatable."
The silver medalist at the Commonwealth, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, said she was "unbelievable" that there are 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The midfielder, Muirová set five British and two European records in the last year alone.
At the World Championships he will take part in the 1500m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the 1,500m track. This season he won the British team races and the Annual Games.
Doyle recalls her first championship, where Lee McConnell was the only other Scottish member.
The team captain led the team to be "very proud" of the fact that not only did a large number of her female colleagues make the team, but in many cases to attack the final and medals.
"The extraordinary thing about being the team captain is that I was elected by the other members of the team. It was a great honour for me, but the knowledge that I was elected by the team members is all so pleasing,' she added.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who made it to the team.
It shows where we've moved.
They're athletes who will be thinking of the front spots on the podium.
And my opening statement?
Yes, I think it was a good one.
I merely drew attention to the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it takes place on home soil.
It is important to take advantage of the support of the home fans and to rejoice in the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I've been given a second chance to race and I'll be enjoying the incredible atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: don't apply for public office unless you bear the voter's criticism
The father of our country knew about his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take the paper long to start criticizing him for anything, from domestic politics to his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave him cold.
But he didn't try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, "The freedom of expression may be taken away from us - and foolish and mute we shall be led as sheep to slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, forcing him to start acting like Washington.
Hogana's employees blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who freely displayed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union for these acts.
The governor's staff dismissed the suit as ground-evident, and there were many views on the internet in the online-type "who cares."
"It's just Facebook," said many users.
Yet it matters.
Especially the moment it's about people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, he is a hugely popular Republican governor.
He can boast the second highest popular favor of all 50 governors.
Hogan is not irascible.
As you can see, it guides its state with certainty of its own and strictly adheres to the principles.
It turned out to be a skillful in using Facebook as the main means of contacting your constituents - the first photo with a bald head was no exception to post-graduate chemotherapy.
Blocking the people who visit the governor's site - which is a public forum, designated as official and managed by his employees paid with taxpayers' money - is pointless and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor, saying that the commentary blocking had been done from a position of moderation for the posts.
But using the image of Internet trolls, spameras or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people who had their posts deleted.
And that is exactly what they are - the real people who speak to their elected leaders; the teacher, the businessman and the pastor, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
In his commentary, the pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, Md. asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I commented frantically that I was disappointed by his lack of reaction to hate crimes and other up-to-date news," she wrote in the Washington Post's notes.
"I don't like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same subject, they are labeled as promoting so-called collective efforts by some people, instead of being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens."
What the governor's staff called "focused spam interest" would probably be called "obhales."
The modern Facebook era allows us to manage our posts easily by blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require staff to be taken to the streets to collect and burn out all the copies with criticism or arrest or silence the Protestants.
And that is exactly what is happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public official to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing legal action from Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first major regulations was born last week in Virginia.
Chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors broke the breach, according to District Judge James C. Cacherise the first amendment in Alexandria, where she prevented one of the voters' access to her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) from Kentucky also received a visit from the ACLU for its use of Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so difficult.
In the days of Washington, the low cost of shipping had virtually the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800 the number of daily newspapers was quadrupled, and his position as leader was questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with the anonymous trolls.
People who, writing under pseudonymous as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote letters to newspapers and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents gathered by the people of the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitions were hoarding in his office criticizing his position against the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation deal with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
The freedom of expression, disapproval and intimidation lies at the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader must accept it.
The Czechs quickly used free roaming, using more data abroad than at home.
Abroad, Czechs use more of their tariff than at home.
They are most likely to travel in Austria, but the consumption of data in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On holiday, they both have more time to browse on the web, under the umbrella, and under the umbire they tend not to be able to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, bathing and smart phone in hand.
This is the typical Czech holiday in Croatia after customers can use the services of the local operators at the domestic prices.
This is according to the recent statistics from O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available as a flat rate than at home.
It is therefore no surprise that in Croatia, where a minimum of us travel over the winter, data consumption has risen even 50-fold in this summer season.
Italy came in second in the list of data consumed.
The Czechs are called for the most minutes from Germany, where many go on business even during the summer.
According to data from the Association of Czech Travel Charters, Croatia is visited by 800,000 Czechs every year, making it our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here swapped the book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
Record was this year's 7. July.
"Tens of a million photographs would fit into the transferred data," said Silvia Cieslare, director of the mobile segment at O2, clarifying details.
Although Croatia leads in the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users is in neighbouring countries.
Austria is in first place, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and an active holiday for which we do not have so much time to browse the internet.
"Despite Austria, the Czechs are heading to the Adriatic," Cieslarová explained.
While data saw high year-on-year growth in data after the loosening of roaming charges, growth is much lower for telephony.
The number of minutes cheated in roaming has doubled compared to last year.
By a huge margin, Germany dominates the country.
"The call in roaming is more used by corporate customers on business trips," Cieslar added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home atmosphere at Renaissance Club
Former golf number one Ronan Rafferty will hope for a relaxing atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in the Scottish West Lothian district of Scotland over the next three days, hosting the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who is from Northern Ireland, lost to Paul Eales to Paul Eales on the foyer golf course on his way to the final on his way to the final. This year, he will perform the role of ambassador of the tournament by the club's founder and CEO, Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club grow up slowly before my eyes and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty," Rafferty said.
"Players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the pitch.
Jerry did a great job.
He is a zealous advocate of this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year's tournament is in the right hands."
Englishman Eales will defend the championship for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I feel good about it," the Southport golfer said.
"I didn't have a chance to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because a year after my victory, the tournament was canceled.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place to play golf.
I remember last year when, for me and my wife, Sharon, the win was a win for me.
It was a beautiful time I won't forget."
Gary Orr returns to his home ground, joining the European Senior Tour after turning 50 from the region this year.
This event will be his first appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
'I'm always happy to play on home turf,' Orr said of Helensburgh.
"You want to get your thrive and you feel a lot of pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I think I'm doing well.
I'm happy with the result so far."
The trio of players will also be joined on the field by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scottish players on the pitch; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAlAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission to the tournament is free. Parking is £5 for a car with one passenger and £10 for a car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian land of gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, he rarely uses a pelvis.
In her wooden shack, located in the capital, Paniai Enarotali, in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the local "nota" language - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, he removes the potato and he enjoys it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on muddy ground - the cottage is not equipped with furniture - where he also performs his daily work, such as washing laundry in cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof substitutes the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any field to cultivation.
Polygamy is common here.
Working until late at night poses a danger: most of the village's men are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, the village houses soldiers.
"No one dares to wander around the village in the afternoon after 5pm," Bardina says.
It is a rare glimpse of everyday life in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote by a public hand-up in the form of a public hand-up in front of the occupying army.
The current movement protesting against the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger to the Yakart government, which controlled the entire region, with the exception of foreign journalists or civilian lawmakers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - the independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a distant and devastated city, which takes place after a 90-minute flight from the capital of Jayapura province to Nabire, and then a five-hour guts gripping by the ride.
Mass transport is not working at this location.
The city of 19,000-seaters consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs of woollen sheets in shades of grey and rusty.
Very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, looked at this place.
Before the Christians arrived, the locals worshipped a god named Ug Tame.
And that's not all.
"We weren't used to wearing this dress," says Bardina, pointing to his colorful, hand-knitted turban, a dark T-shirt and a shining skirt.
"We used to only wear leaves."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line, and the local infant mortality and literacy is one of the worst in Asia.
But it is also the Indonesian land of gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoeenix, Freeport McMoran, is only 60 miles from the Paniai - a rocky province of about the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua supports logging worth an estimated $78 billion.
Nevertheless, these riches are a source of suffering and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army for the Papuans.
An investigation conducted by the New York Times in 2005 shows that Freeport paid local military officials and troops about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including the sum of $150,000 for an officer.
Papuans calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands of others have been raped, tormented and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass murders in the tribal area of Papua during the 1970s amounted to genocide, as the Asian Human Rights Commission said.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful Protestants in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a report from the Archdiocese of Brisbanese in 2016, describes the atrocities that took place last year as out-of-court executions, torture - according to another report, rape and electrocute execution are particularly popular - and the brutal repression of peaceful protesters.
"It's difficult to calculate the number of victims because incidents occur weekly," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian research fellow at Human Rights Watch.
The situation was aggravated by the fact that papuan sources attract colonists to Indonesia.
Of the country's 3.5 million people in the province, 83% are committed to Christianity, but demography is changing with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The Javánan cantins sell fried chicken and gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
"Imigrants started selling chicken and vegetables at traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans," explains 24-year-old Abeth You, who was born to Paniai and moved to work in the capital of the province of Jayapura.
"The original inhabitants of Papua - mama-mama (women) - have lost their jobs."
In his 2014 presidential campaign, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who is dubbed Jokowi, promised to address inequality and rights violations.
The former carpenter secured and secured his trip to the presidential palace in the Jacobi family in the first floor in the first place, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our heart has been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with the hope of heeding our call for justice," You said.
The fact is that just two months after the inauguration of Jakowi in October, Paniai had a major shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at a campfire in the town of Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on motorbikes emerged from the gloom of the night.
Two of the startled children were told to turn on their lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by this rebuke and the tone she was addressed to and later returned with four other soldiers, local vicar Yaved Tebai said.
Two of the soldiers in the drunken state pursued a group of children and beat them with the buttts of their weapons, the victims and witnesses of the event said.
One of the soldiers then fired at a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to the nearby electoral commission building, and the following day things escalated.
About 1,000 young Papua men and women gathered on the football pitch in front of the local police station and army headquarters, demanding justice.
They came with the ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - in which it is run in a circle and the singing of the birds is imitated - the Papuan tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants began throwing rocks at the buildings.
With escalating tension, the soldiers were ordered to the radio: "If a crowd tries to resist at least three times, you have permission to shoot," the TIME weekly said in an official document whose content was never published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the head of Enarotali Kego Koto, recognized the imminent danger and urged residents to break up to their homes.
But no one was heeded of his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame does not yet know who the shooter was, but in his words, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people all around and there were a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the local residents, Alfius Youw, was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to the body to see that it was really him," Yohanes, who uses only one name, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name, told TIME.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told the newspaper that his officers were merely "ensuring" a station under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people are threatening to kill us," Papa Police press spokesperson, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many escaped injuries.
The news of the murders was punctuated by the Jakub media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a heated speech in Jayapura and expressed his understanding for the families of the victims and vowed to deal with the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never be repeated," he said.
National Security Minister Wiranto announced in October 2016 that he would introduce an out-of-court mechanism to resolve the acts of violence that had taken place in the past.
Almost immediately, however, there were excuses.
"Most of the acts of violence occurred long ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
What I mean is that we are determined to punish these acts of violence, but it will not be a simple task," he said.
In an interview from 5. However, for the weekly TIME, held in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he did not plan to introduce any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that "all cases will be referred to the court."
Wiranto, whom the UN has accused of "crime against humanity" on the basis of more than one thousand deaths during the independent elections of 1999 in East Timor - said that 11 human rights violations in Papua have been settled so far, including the incident in Paniai.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai welcomed his claims with disbelief.
"I've been asked four times in the last three years, but I haven't gotten anything until now," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, he still lives in fear for several years later.
"I'm afraid," as he claims.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many residents of Paniai, who are afraid to talk about the incident.
In his words, he was beaten by members of the army after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the body burial, the army started looking for me," he said.
And the shooting is not yet up.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired shots at villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
The scuffle in which one person died and another 17 were injured occurred between the villagers and a construction manager, who refused to provide assistance in transporting the man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company building.
According to police, the villagers threw rocks at the members and were warned about the warning.
However, local residents claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitarist police) opened fire in the crowd, killing one person.
"There was panic, we were afraid of retribution," said 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured.
"I didn't leave the house for two days."
The Deiyaiso parliament demanded the punishment of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
The Paniai has always been a thorn in the side of the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only exacerbates the separation of indigenous people of the tribes of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live in the central highlands.
Many of them joined the Pasuai Liberation Movement (OPM) - an army of rebels that protects the Papuans' rights by attacking and abducting Indonesian police officers.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniai. He is among the most of Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of residents of the Paniiai in recent years, all on the pretext of "acquiring national sovereignty."
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among the people of Papuai as a "tragic and forgotten place."
Oil flies to the fire is pouring in poverty.
The few rice sold in the Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And the bread is equally unattainable.
The inhabitants of this place grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruit and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each works four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for the needs of the family, the rest they sell on the local market.
Ten of the sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened more air routes and new immigrants began pouring into the country, economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants has been increasing.
So far, so few jobs are usually occupied by more educated and richer immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the necessary capital and education to go into business.
"Young people are moving out of the villages because of a lack of job opportunities and money," said John Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
Thanks to the isolation, Papua Province is hidden from the world.
This is also helped by strict rules for foreign journalists.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from the papui for the sake of "lack of cooperation with the authorities" all this despite the fact that they were given such a rare permit for filming.
In his election campaign, Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, promised to abolish the strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development. But that never happened.
"Free journalists who work in the rebellious easternmost areas of Papua and West Papua are at high risk: visa recognition and blacklist recognition," he said in a statement.
The lack of news from the offshore members of the offshore means that the international pressure on Indonesia's Papua case is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council on the investigation into "distorted and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including the missile in Pania.
These countries have also supported the OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir shook off the charges when he told journalists in Jakarta that: "A democratic system is still in place in Indonesia and the media are free, so it is difficult to disguise evidence of human rights violations."
Local people are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Human Rights Envoy, Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on May 4, local people cheated, according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the slogan "we want to be free."
There are other elections in Indonesia for 2019, but the Cossacks say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man with good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Paniai," said Gobau, the tribal council chairman.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai - in addition to living in constant fear of a robbery army - were rolling in poor, miserable education, and the health system.
Gobai argues that the people of Paniai, like the other Papuans, regard their vote as a "lust" to be repaid by the Jokowi.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family of the victims of the Panyais shooting, they continue in the last symbolic act of defiance: bury the bodies of the victims on the property opposite the police and army stations.
Knowing that justice will never be done for enough, at least he will not allow the persons responsible to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said, his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy intercepted a huge cocaine shipment to Australia.
The French Navy intercepted a yacht in the Pacific carrying 1.46 tonnes of cocaine worth around $256 million.
The shipment was headed for Australia.
The intervention arrested the four-man crew of the ship, apparently consisting of people from Lithuania and Latvia.
The yacht, named Afalina, sailed from South America, and was dragged by police after being detained to a port in the city of Nouméa, the capital of the French overseas territory of the New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian Intelligence Agency said it would seek, in cooperation with its international partners, to determine exactly where and where the drugs were directed and to expose the "Lithuanian syndicate."
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures to stop the large number of drugs bound for Australia," said its managing director, Col Blanch.
The drugs were destroyed in Noumée this week.
Australia is an attractive target for their smugglers because of the high street prices of drugs.
The country is also facing the problem of growing numbers of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current crackdown is not the first in recent times.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting large amounts of drugs from the United States to Australia, which they attempted to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
Seniors don't feel thirsty, they need to be reminded of drinking.
The problem may be in homes for the elderly, the solution, according to the doctor at the Geriatric Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague, Pavla Mádlová, could be an infusion of saline, which is injected with a thin needle under the skin.
These, however, are only applied in medical facilities.
The older you get, the more water in your body drops.
"Moreover, they lose their thirst, so seniors generally take in less fluids and dehydrate very quickly," said Madi.
Two grand should be drunk for sure.
"But getting so many fluids into the old person is a big problem," she added.
In homes for the elderly, she says, no doctor often does.
In hospitals, they routinely deal with dehydration with infusions.
"I think that it should be gradually introduced there, too, so that they can receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
In a day, she says, up to two pint bottles of saline can be delivered to old people.
Fluid deficiency can cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration will prove to be a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day, the old man says he can't get out of bed, he talks in confusion," she added.
In the event of neglect, it can result in a stroke.
The blood thickens and clogs the blood vessel in the brain, and there is also a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a blanket, a maximum of cotton sheets.
The problem may also be one-off diapers.
"It's more nursing, but the ideal would be to uncover the patient from time to time and let the skin air out," the doctor said.
Dubai was on fire for the second time with the skyscraper The Torch
In Dubai on Friday, one of the world's largest residential skyscrapers went on fire. Firefighters had to evacuate all residents of the 337-meter-high and 79-storey building.
This is the second fire in this high-rise building in the last two years, which bears the fitting name The Torch.
The evacuated all the residents of the building and there were no injuries. The cause of the fire is unknown.
"We slept and the alarm woke us up. We heard the screams.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor," Geroge, one of the residents of the skyscraper, told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defense said firefighters were able to bring the blaze under control around 4 a.m. (at GMT), whereupon the cooling of the building.
Government officials added that they provide alternative accommodation for the affected residents.
The incident could again spark debate about the safety of the materials used to lining high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation launched by the Torch skyscraper management after a fire in 2015 showed that the lining and external panels used for decoration or isolation were most damaged.
British police said the Grenfell Tower of London's isolation and lining system may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in the June fire, which killed nearly 80 people.
The survey results showed that more than one in five passengers to the US was delivering banned items on board the aircraft
A survey of passengers showed that more than twenty percent consciously or unconsciously made banned items through the U.S. state-run Transportation Security Administration checkpoints on board the plane. At least six per cent of passengers entered boarded planes with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers say they belatedly found out they were traveling with a firearm, ammunition or an explosive.
The results of a survey conducted by the airline Stratos, Jet Charters Inc. - to which more than 1,000 interviewers replied - showed that younger passengers were more likely to be violated by the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had attempted to knowingly travel with a TSA-banning object, 19.7 per cent of passengers were with several thousand hours flown compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
The most common items that leaked TSA's attention are food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents knowingly made a sharp object through security, while 2.2 percent of the women surveyed and 3.7 percent of the men surveyed also admitted that they had deliberately brought banned drugs on board the plane.
The company said it had conducted research among passengers around the world to see how many of them randomly outsourced unauthorized items through airport inspection and how much had done so on purpose.
It is no surprise that most people who have transferred unauthorised objects - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what fluids and how much they can make on the plane.
It is no surprise, then, that TSA has seized the most prohibited fluids in the largest amount.
For a time, people thought TSA would handle books in the same way as smuggled goods.
Fluid transport is allowed in domestic flights, not international flights.
EPA chief Scott Pruitt on postponing planned directives to reduce emissions from the Obama administration
After the Environment Protection Agency was sued to fifteen states, its chief, Scott Pruitt, dismissed his earlier decision to delay implementing the former Obama administration's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes to his plan. It responds more briskly than previous governments to the needs of the national environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention a legal challenge against his previous position at the Federal Court of Appeal.
This concerns the last deadline, which was set at 1. October, when states should start implementing the 2015 regulation to reduce the amount of ground-floor ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the agreement for one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "interventions with local decisions or impending economic growth."
Pruitt, who held the position of state prosecutor Oklahoma as president of the EPA as president, to be appointed for a long time as President Donald Trump, served for a long time as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed the regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
The sudden turnaround on Wednesday is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA executor had exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the inclusion of the Obama administration plan, which required diesel and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and strengthened the EPA's commitment to cooperate with states through comprehensive processes and the fulfilment of the new standards within the time frame.
"Under the government of the previous administration, the EPA did not often meet deadlines and waited for it to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and further set up plans," said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation and we take the deadline seriously.
We never joke about the statute and authority that emerges from it."
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt can use at a certain point of reference "the possibility of a delay and all other legally available authorities" to ensure that regulations "based on sound policy and the most affordable information."
Republicans in congress are pushing for a more detailed transcript of ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure has still not passed the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed a coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group did not intend to allow legal pressure.
"The EPA's views - following our lawsuit - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Washington, D.C.
Ground-ground ozone is produced when normal harmful substances emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists acknowledge Pruitt's sudden change with grate.
"It is worrying what kind of pressure the pressure needs to be exerted to change the minds of the people of the responsible and protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burden of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to wrestle with the ideological campaign of the Trump administration, which seeks to facilitate polluters and special interests."
He doused the man with acid, yet he is not dangerous, according to the court.
You never know what could happen to you.
One minute you're at home with your family and you're laughing, the next you suddenly change your whole life from the ground up.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate befell Andreas Christopher of the UK, whose face was filtered with acid by an unknown assailant who was eventually acquitted.
The information was reported by the Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone at the Christophers' door knocked on the door.
Andreas got up to go open.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door to deliver Christmas gifts for the family that day.
Instead, he was in for a cruel surprise.
The man he had never seen in his life poured acid on him immediately after opening without warning, saying, "This is for you, my friend."
The pain was indescribable.
My clothes fell apart on me like nothing and I felt only an incredible pain on my skin," said Andreas.
The family rushed him to the hospital, but his loved ones learned the terrible news - he had no chance of surviving, according to the doctors.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent of the face the doctors were trying to put together with skin from other parts of the patient's body.
A big complication for Christopher was the loss of the eyelids.
It's probably the most cotchoing thing I've ever had.
"You can't hide from an unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he said, describing his torment.
Today, Christopheros has had twelve surgeries under his past, far from the last.
Injunctions that suffer from acid-related victims may require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after a demanding and long-term treatment, the victims of the tissue have their scar tissue for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover and fight for the whole life of deformity and disfigurement," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is certain that the unidentified man must have mistaken him for someone.
The perpetrator believed he was retaliating against a man who sexually abused his close person.
Police duly investigated the case and eventually tracked down the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later, the verdict changed fundamentally, to the astonishment of Christopheros's family.
"Three judges eventually concluded that the sentence should be overturned as the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
Over the past few years, the number of amorphous agents has increased considerably.
The country's Interior Ministry has commented on the issue as planning to set new guidelines to prosecutors on the classification of corrosives.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
But victims of such attacks are not about to be abandoned.
They are calling for the UK government to push for more severe and longer prison terms for people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also call for toughened controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in different shops as they are different cleaning products.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai, the famous skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world, was on fire at night.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence, the residents of the 80-story building were evacuated in time and no one was injured.
According to a Dubai police spokesman, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread up.
According to several residents of the house, however, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, this is how they told us," one of the tenants said.
Also, according to another tenant cited by Reuters, the fire broke out at the highest levels and spread down with falling hot debris.
We were sleeping.
We woke up by the alarm, people were screaming.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," the tenant, George, described the events.
Another witness to CNN estimated that about 40 apartments had engulfed the flames.
On the ground, the fire destroyed at least two cars when burning parts of the building hit them.
After about two hours, according to a statement from the civil defense, the fire was brought under control.
The cause of its creation is not yet known.
Witnesses say the power went out in the surrounding buildings.
The large fire was also damaged by the Dubai skyscraper The Torch in February 2015, destroying over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
No one was hurt at the time either, as the residents were evacuated in time.
The Torch skyscraper was built in 2011 and then became the world's tallest residential building with its 352 metres.
He was set for a record the following year by another Dubai skyscraper.
The bodybuilder had an astonishing 14 doping substances in his system.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, a sample of 23-year-old Ippolito was present in a variety of illicit products - from steroids to diuretics to drugs for Parkinson's disease or anorexia.
Ironically, even this wild mix did not help him to the title, finishing fourth.
The bodybuilder now faces a four-year suspension and prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, a record amount of athletes caught up to that point.
The third-tier player said he started taking steroids the year before when he fell into bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She embraced passionately with her former lover!
She is barely in the Czech Republic that Lucka Vondráčková is in one round.
And it also attracts attention wherever he goes.
The last time her ex-lover, Michal Dlouhý, with whom she had lived for three years, fell into her arms.
The actor was 12 years older then and was already longing for a family.
Lucie was only 19 years old at the time, and she certainly had no desire to hang up on her career.
So they came apart, but remained friends to this day.
Which they also proved at the TV Prima press conference, where they met after a long time.
By coincidence, the two of them matched into a blue color.
At first they ignored each other, but then they became close, and Lucie laughed at Michael's jokes, to her stomach.
Then they huired and posed willingly for the photographers.
Their meeting, however, was no accident, as the couple in the new series Prima, Captain Exner, will play together.
The Islamists were given life in the UK for preparing an assassination.
A British court on Thursday sent four members of the Islamist cell to prison for life, calling themselves the Three Musketeers and, according to the prosecutor's office, was planning a terrorist attack against the police and the army.
The four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and had previously been convicted of similar acts, were arrested last August.
Authorities at the time thought he was going to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions that mean "unbelieving" in Arabic, and a mock-up of the gun.
It happened when the MI5 Secret Service agent was placing a listening device in the car.
"Recent assassinations have shown the horror of the defendants if they were not stopped," said prosecutor Sue Hemming.
Three convicts, aged 28, 25 and 33, may apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convict, who is 38, can do so after just 15 years behind bars.
The men at the trial in London claimed to be innocent and that the guns found in the car were placed there by the MI5 agent.
The court also heard from him, but then rejected the defendants' claims.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
Hodonínsk measured 38.3 °C.
Tuesday's 37.3-degree Celsius temperature record remained at the top for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius recorded in Strážnice na Hodonínsko, it was surpassed by Thursday, which thus became the hottest day so far this year.
This was confirmed by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Compared to Tuesday, however, there were not many temperature records on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records were broken or a setup were set at 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
For example, in Strážnice, Thursday's temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice, Břeclav, on Thursday, 37.4 degrees, it surpassed the original maximum by four-tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice in Brno the current 37.1 degrees, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
In the west, it was ten degrees lower.
High temperatures appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia on Thursday.
After Strážnice, the heat was in Dyjákovice in Znojmo and Brod nad Dyjí on Břeclavsk, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
By contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, Thursday's highest temperatures so far were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The heaters started to grow there only later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside, according to the ČHMÚ, and on Sunday there could be significant rains.
In most places of Moravia, however, the high temperatures will remain on Friday and in southeast Moravia on Saturday.
China lacks tourists.
Beijing is losing billions to visa policy.
China has sought to exert its influence for decades without using power.
He spends $10 billion a year to support language schools and build universities abroad, pushes its entertainment industry to foreign markets, and tries to attract Western tourists.
But Beijing is failing.
The country's state media are talking about a plan to make tourism the driving force of economic transformation and modernization.
But the number of arrivals grew by only 3.8 percent last year, and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, the situation in the world's most populous country in the world is assessed by the University of Economics professor Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for itself is Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free travel with China, the citizens of the others have to take out their visa in advance.
At the Chinese authorities in the US, the crowds are therefore comparable to the Chinese new year celebrations.
A visa costs $140, but if you don't want to wait for it for hours in line, you have to pay $100 or more for additional services.
Such restrictions create significant economic barriers.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for a visa reduces the country's number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and less than one percent of all population lives there, was visited by 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens the problem itself by using tourism to pursue its political goals, such as disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
In the spring, when China cut back on transport to South Korea as part of a spat at the South Korean anti-missile system, the South Koreans returned the favor and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan was up 85 percent.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the US Federal Reserve, the Fed could have left China as a result of foreign trips by Chinese, while China receives about $35 billion annually as part of its currency sales to incoming tourists.
According to official figures on the balance of payments, China had a deficit of $217 billion in tourism last year, equivalent to 44 percent of China's entire surplus in the goods trade.
So the small number of tourists are inflicting a very painful blow to the country that scrupulously prevents capital outflows.
However, the factors mentioned above are only one manifestation of more intimate restraint against foreigners.
In many parts of China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
As recently as 2013, there were fewer than a million foreigners living in all of China.
There are more of them in the United States and some individual cities.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, has double that.
Meanwhile, many scientific papers show that immigrants typically revive economic growth, entrepreneurship, and innovation.
In China, however, you will barely find them.
Addressing these problems will be politically challenging, but the move to be offered is to simplify the visa apparatus.
Other Asian nations, in particular India and Vietnam, have recently made a major effort to simplify and make visa procedures easier and cheaper.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
They reproduced the deadly poisonous reptiles at the Pilsen Zoo.
The Pilsen Kingdom of the poison can be enjoyed by the cubs of three rare, deadly poisonous reptiles.
In the exhibition, visitors will only see all nine newly born Turkish vipers.
This species is in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2,000 metres.
"It grows even metres long," said zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba.
Meanwhile, the chicks of the other two species, the deadly and the red cobras, will gain strength in the garden's breeding grounds.
We can't tell when people will see them yet.
"We would not like to lose them," said nurse Miroslav Dohnal, noting that it could take a year or two.
Eight of the Australian deaths of vipers were born, the offspring of a breeding pair native to the population around Sydney.
"The individual that visitors can see in the exhibit belongs to the lethal-seaters from the vicinity of Perth," Vobruba said, noting that in human care, a 6-8-week wintering is required for the deathson at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
The 100% success was accompanied by a clutch of a Polish spitting red cobra.
The couple at the Pilsen Zoo, a total of four cubs were made of four eggs.
"The incoubation took 65 days," Vobruba said.
This species in nature is sprayed with poison on its victim, up to a distance of up to four metres.
He's aiming for the eyes, it can cause a lasting blindness.
The cubs of all three species feed on mouse shave at the zoo.
Within 40 days in the garden they are still expecting to hatch the cubs from the table of mamba black, the eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to an unverified rewrite of a telephone conversation, Trump is putting pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post reported a transcript of President Trump's phone calls to leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27 telephone interview with Mexican President Enrique Peña, Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly proclaiming that he would not pay for the proposed wall.
The US president reproached him for publicly condemning the construction of the wall, supposedly saying, "You can't speak like that in the press."
As part of his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern border and proclaim that Mexico would pay for it.
A transcript of his first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has also leaked to the public, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the US surveillance agreement for refugees bound for Australia was "ridiculous" and "stupid" and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which came under President Obama - it would look as if he agreed to a "drugged" ban on refugees to the US.
Trump ended the call after he explained to Turnbull that "this is my most unpleasant call of the day."
Tusk testified again at the Prosecutor's Office for Smolensk.
"He has something to be afraid of," said the dead president's brother, the chairman of the governing Law and Justice PiS party, Jaroslaw Kaczyński, in Tusk's address.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczyński will not intimidate me," Tusk replied, accusing the country's current leadership of trying to abuse the judiciary against political rivals.
As he left the prosecutor's office, a crowd of Donald Tusk was chanted by Donald Tusk! and wished the politician Hundred Years!
Tusk thanked for his support and assured that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczyński will not intimidate me."
He says he does not blame the prosecutors, but he has no doubt that the judiciary should serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against rivals, opposition or people they dislike, and I fear that I belong to this group.
He was interviewed for the second time.
The ex-Prime Minister was questioned at the prosecution for the second time, this time the interrogation involved misconduct in the autopsies of the victims of the Smolensk disaster.
Additionally, it was discovered to be a substitution of bodies in coffins.
Families were forbidden to open coffins, and there had to be some reasons for that.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal because it would weigh on Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, was intended to serve to Donald Tusk becoming someone very important in the EU," Kaczyński claimed on the Catholic television network Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would thwart Tusk's chances of winning the most important seat in the union, of which Poland has absolutely nothing.
Kaczyński also said that he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that things could be different with Donald Tusk, but she ignored it.
Tusk underwent an eight-hour interrogation at the prosecution as early as April 19.
He did not testify as a suspect then, only as a witness.
However, many saw his summons for questioning as part of the Polish government's apparent effort by the Polish government and PiS chief Kaczyński to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking to various scandals.
The prosecution is subordinate to the Minister of Justice in Poland, who performs the role of the Attorney-General.
The summons for questioning came soon after the election of Tusk as head of the European Council, whom Kaczyński struggled but tried in vain to prevent, including during a visit to Merkel in Warsaw.
At the EU summit, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo protested alone against the extension of Tusk's mandate.
In this case, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán also let Warsaw down.
Both Burma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote everywhere?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote newly on the composition of the House from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its embassy offices since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
This follows from the decree governing the delivery of ballots abroad.
The State Department has prepared an update to it, and is currently under comment.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted for MPs abroad.
"Since the last amendment to the decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry justifies its approach.
"New embassage offices have been established in some countries, some of the authorities have been closed, or there has been a change in the level of representation," the document reads.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which lists the embassies on which the paper ballots are supplied.
This group of authorities includes representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot paper in the press version.
It is their list that changes with the decree.
Four years ago, Czechs could have voted, for example, at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, the two embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic has also cancelled its representation in Bamako, Malaysia, and Kyoto, Japan.
There will also be no vote at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic was closed in 2014 because of the war in eastern Ukraine.
Newly on the list of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, the Senegalese capital of Dakar and the Zambian Lusace.
In Asia, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation since the last parliamentary elections to include the Consulate General in Irbil, Iraq, and Chengdu, the capital of China's Sichuan Province.
Voting ballots will also be available for registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to choose MPs at the polling stations at embassies or consulates four times so far.
In the run-up to each election, the state election commission will draw a moss at the draw, with whose candidates are voted on abroad.
The first time was in 2002, when the decision was made between the South Moravian candidates.
At the following two elections, the Czechs voted abroad among the South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, the Central Bohemian Region was selected as well as this year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
Some 3,800 people came to vote at the premiere 15 years ago, around 67,700 in 2006, 8222 four years later.
Early House elections four years ago, 10,571 voters turned out to be at the embassies.
Moore's Ford Bridge massacre: activists commemorate racist lynching
The 1948 Ford Mercury passed the onlookers of Monroe, Georgia, and bumped toward the Moore's Ford Bridge.
But by the time the four-length black passenger car and the white driver reached the bridge, a group of white men with guns had blocked his path.
The group's leader - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - drew a long drag on from his cigarette and looked at the windshield of the car.
Inside, the passengers were shaking with fear.
"We want the n--and Roger!" the man yelled.
"Bring it to me!"
The silence is interrupted by the roar of a young black man being pulled from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is merely a reconstruction of the events that took place on the 22nd. July.
But when one of the men throws a noose over the "Roger" neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have been returning to the Moore's Ford Bridge on a regular basis, reconstructing the fateful night of 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by Kukluxklan members.
No one has ever been tried for the murders.
"It's a wonder that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identities," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reconstruction of the event.
"It's a stain on our history and the burden in our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia State Congressman and lifelong civil rights campaigner.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event presents a dramatic challenge to hold. Every year, Monroe reminds the community of the city that justice has not been served.
"We demand for prosecution and the conclusion of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice first," said Brooks.
"Until then, the recovery and reconciliation process cannot be initiated."
The medical examiner is covering 27. July 1946 one of the bodies of the lynching victims at Moore's Ford.
According to the FBI's files, which received NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding districts were to take part in the lynching.
However, no one has yet been prosecuted.
Despite the fact that the suspects remain free for decades, the supporters of civil rights claim that both the reasons for the lynching - the politic and sex - were known to all the city's residents.
In April 1946, under a Supreme Court ruling, the black-skinned residents of the state of Georgia were given the right to participate in the elections scheduled for the summer.
And it was during the summer election that the black-skilled farmer, according to the FBI, was supposedly to be stabbing the owner of the white-skinned land owner, Barnett Hester, during the scuffle - allegedly because of his wife.
In the city, according to Brooks, it was the tradition that Hester had been commaking with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and brought her to a different state.
According to the FBI, he composed 25. July 1946 by the then-perile white landowner Loy Harrison for Malcoma bail of $600.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
On their return from the prison, just before the entrance to the Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects blocked their way.
"As it turns out, the murders were planned and orchestrated by Harrison," the FBI concluded.
"It is also clear that there was a collision between the State and local law enforcement officers, who not only participated in the lynching but also disposed of the evidence and withholding the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks commented more briefly on the matter.
"It was a massacre for the right to vote," he said.
"The murders had a clear subtext for all the local black people: 'this is what you'll get if you register and go for the election.'"
The annual reconstruction of the event at the Moore's Ford Bridge is organized by Cassandra Greene for almost a decade.
Her performance is figurative, engaging and concise. It shows deep-seated racism that many would like to find extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction is not easy and even more difficult to avert avertea, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching because we have to face the uncomfortable feelings that are hidden in all of us," Greene said.
"But there can be no relationship between us unless you listen to what I've gone through."
The main rehearsals for this year's renovation began in June, and on the first day, approximately 30 actors - a dozen white men, the rest of blacks - flocked to the room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned show.
Wade Marbaugh is a position of assistant director.
He played the leader of the Kukluxklan for many years, but in his words the role is exhausting.
"I feel bad about it because it goes against who I am," Marbaugh said.
"I think it's very important to be reminded of this part of history on a regular basis, because we never want to go back to that time."
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malto, or Barnett Hester, rehearse their roles.
The show begins with a scuffle - Malcom argues with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get off my property n-e!"
Rascona is not available.
There's a scuffle.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black-skinned actor) explodes in a laugh.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" asks Rascon.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," Greene says cheerfully.
"I just don't think the white people said 'n--r' that in that tone.'
"Exactly," one of the black-skilled actors blurts.
"You must put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility is replaced by a sense of rapprochement.
Everybody wants the show to be authentic. Just to be worth enough for the four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
Rascona this time emphasizes the correct utness of the word on N.
Now no one's laughing.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Scream, gunshots... and there was silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of the actors and sings Billie Holiday's mournful song "Strange Fruit."
With every word, there's sadness in the room.
Against the backdrop of it all, a dozen onlookers wipe the sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience has virtually the same number of blacks and whites.
One pair arrived all the way from New York's Ithaca, many onlookers from the neighborhood.
Each of them lays the local damp climate for nearly eight hours, and Brooks leads them in a crowd to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until now, the murders could have been viewed with hindsight, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is haunting.
With the last words of the song, Greene challenges the crowd of onlookers to inspect the bodies.
Children kneel at the victims' heads, watch the fake blood and the still bodies, and whisper in their ears.
"They're not dead," the little boy says.
A few minutes pass and Greene will thank the audience. It's over.
The actors clean the rope and scrape their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit, who played the Kukluxklan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs his two friends-actor and cries out in their arms; in the end, emotion comes at him.
"It's all right," one of the women whispers.
"We know you're abusing the part.
But you had a reason for that."
Later that day, the audience and the actors sit for dinner.
At one table, the young white couple are talking with interest of a show with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski was barely finding the words to express her sense of the show today.
"It's difficult to listen to those ugly words and look at those hideous deeds... that are done by people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said of the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still a topical topic," she added, "only called police skirmishes."
Across the room, Tyrone Brooks is sitting in the courtroom. He saves dinner while talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he had already begun planning the show for the next year.
"The re-construction of these events is inspiring, as it describes the fear we had to experience - but it is also a moment to think about it," he said.
"If we don't learn from it, who knows . . . it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are doomed to repeat it."
I love the instructions for use.
A friend of mine says he only reads the instructions for use.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
I remember with nostalgia the days of the long past, where the instructions for using anything were more of a rare phenomenon.
For example, my first gramophone contained only one piece of paper with hieroglyphics showing the involvement of any components, all of which were some secret brands.
Years later, when something inside went wrong, I offered the deed to a shaman who wasn't afraid to unscrew the back of the back.
With a grin, he advised me on what the labyrinth of the lines was for.
Yes, it was a used tool for chronic depletion of toilet paper.
He graciously found the disconnected wire and allowed me to listen to the expensive vinyl tortillas again.
The new age brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple, fruit juicher, where he simply clung to the cross-covered grep, required about ten pictures.
Particularly hilarious was a sketcher with a description of how to tuck one part into another.
The set was a two-part one, and a different procedure was simply not possible.
To give it the other way required considerable effort, with the need to break off certain plastic components.
My contempt for the instructions ended with my Seat Leon self-propelled.
The year of production 2003 still had such a book with a manual of minor repairs, which included, among other things, the replacement of the blinker light bulb.
It was easy.
Three steps in all and the work was to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the instructions neglected to state that while the light bulb on the right really only went to replace in three steps.
1. take the cover.
2. unscrewed the cracked bulb and screw the new one.
3. dry the cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem in the form of the location of the battery cover.
At first I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the bowels of the car, I was finding a spring, a screw that would easily push the cover away and then follow the 1-3 empowering of the help book's 1-3 economical author.
A mistake for the catwalk.
The cover had no place, no space for the slender hand of Cinderella, let alone the obese Silesian.
I've lost half an hour of my life, and without any success.
The condition was exacerbated by my wife's entry into the garage, summoned by the roar and the words he hears from my mouth quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked innocently.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, however, if I miss the vulgar terms, there were only two published words left.
I'm changing the light bulb.
"And why is this taking you so long?" she risked the phrase, which may be her last in the long-lasting union.
I explained the problem to her slowly, with the main emphasis on the torsion of the author of the manual, where the blessing of the hot iron on the hand that wrote the instructions, then the beating of it so that he could never write anything again, was merely an introduction to a wide range of Witch's Witch's instructions, including his commissioning burning on the top above the Losin Castle.
"How about dismantling the box?" the woman said, removing the battery.
In sheer desperation, this happened, and then the 1-3 step was as easy and quick as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
This was until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just coming out of the collapse after checking for two female civil servants of the State Drug Enforcement Administration.
I know him as a colleague who has experienced both the possible and impossible in the business, and who can tell wild stories in an unperturbed voice.
"Imagine getting a ticket for not having the hand-wash instructions displayed," he told me in a weak voice.
Gradually, I drew out of him the whole problem, which was that over the sink in the toilet of the patients, he did not have a picture guide to wash his hands.
His argument of the commissioner that adults could generally wash their hands, and that there was no need for pictograms to cope with the accustomed activities of decent people, had no healing effect and cost him a lot of money.
"It's not easy," she told him.
He understood that the simple rinse of the soapy palm-flying with water was a primitive act on the level of the Cromanon, that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performed this ceremony in ten steps.
So it is necessary to say that it is necessary to release water from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end it is a joyous discovery that one has washed one's hands exactly as the SÚKL hosudar orders him to do.
Finally, I must point out that I was inspired and preparing a detailed plan for the work in the toilet.
On the issue of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will be no problem, for urination, given certain differences between the sexes, it will be necessary to post instructions two.
The pictograms remain a problem, as it also means a precise drawing of all anatomical details, which could arouse some outrage at the prudese hive, despite finally being able to learn that he had mopped the opening in a completely flawed manner throughout his life.
Pearson to lay off an additional 3,000 employees and cuts dividends in an effort to revive trade
The British training group Pearson said on Friday that it would lay off an additional 3,000 employees and cut the provisional dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring programme to change the business model.
Another wave of redundancies, which, according to CEO John Fallon, will take place at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, is followed by the company's previous decision to lay off 4,000 employees as part of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by an additional £300 million ($394 million) in May as part of a third cost-cutting program in an effort to resurrect declining trade as a result of the sharp development of digital education.
The company that last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after announcing a 1% increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on Kabul convoy: NATO soldiers killed in suicide blast
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital, Afghanistan, Kabul. A NATO soldier died in the attack and several others were wounded, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, NATO's comments are reported.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians also died in the attack in the city district of Qarabagh.
A bomb attack hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in an explosion at a Herátsk mosque on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in its comments that Tuesday's explosion took place after a patrol with members of the Afghan army was attacked by a "local person with a homemade explosive device" along with a home-made explosive device."
The statement also states that all the wounded soldiers are out of danger and are in a U.S. military hospital at the Brum Air Force Base.
According to the rapporteur, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh region is an important source of concern for NATO allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of whom died in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul's Shia district.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31, a major explosion in the city centre killed more than 150 people. This is the deadliest militant attack in the country since US troops overthrew the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence is undermining the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops to assist military forces and police officers in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, the suicide attacks to which the enchours in recent weeks were shaken by public confidence in the government, its regulations and, in particular, in the reputation of President Asraf Ghanaan.
In response to the lawsuit, the EPA revised its decision to delay smoking rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency revoked its decision to postpone the Obama administration's law, which mandated states to cut emissions, just a day after 15 states sued the agency.
In the night hours on Wednesday, the EPA announced its decision to refer to the "First Standards 2015" with the words that it was making a commitment of the Agency to cooperate with the states.
"We believe in the dialogue with our state-ranking partners and will hear their views," EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced EPA's efforts to delay ozone standards - which measure real air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on measurements, determine the limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen of most Democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed the suit on Tuesday on the grounds that the EPA's conduct was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration seeks to prevent many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - in Trump's words - in an attempt to kick economic growth.
But the new government's efforts have launched countermeasures from Democrats and conservative groups that fear the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA states on its website that air breathing with ozone content "may reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Singer Ladislav Drummer got hit and blood flowing!
You may have already registered this, a relatively new singer, in June of this year, when this hitherto unknown singer in the Czech Republic held a monstrous event for Czech standards, hosting such leading personalities as master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was not directed by anyone other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to be shown to the public and present his music video for the song Sara, whose baptism was performed by the just-appointed personalities.
But few people already know that the actual filming of the music video, which took place in Russia, was not without its problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first major shoot with the stars of the Russian national ballet, and it was not without any major embarrassment.
The song Sara is very emotional and is based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
For the drama of the scene, the singer's rival was to hint at a slap punch in the singer's music video.
At one point, however, he struck him so hard and squarely on the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I didn't expect it, my nose was immediately started," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers said the situation on set that it was an accident and Ladislav was unable to react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not serious enough to affect the sequel in the next shoot.
We bring you the young artist's music video now, you can also record the punch scene.
The failed version of the blood, however, was not used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at the meeting about the possibilities of the mutual duel
Vsyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting boxing boxing match in lightweight, first met at a meeting on Tuesday.
Each of them was in a separate room in the ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia - the undefeated lightweight champion World Boxing Council - went down to the hall where he welcomed Lomacko, the featherweight champion of the World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's victory on the unanimous decision against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's Showtime game, the two boxers made the list of the top five lightweight boxers.
Garcia cocked his right-hand side and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends his title at 7:00hus on Saturday against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN.
Boxers are posing for photographers, and manager Lomacenka Egis Klimas adds that a potential contest of boxers would be a "perfect test."
"I'm a former featherweight champion," Garcia adds.
"I had to gain weight for the Broner fight (67 kg), but I'm not that big.
At my 63kg, I'm small.
I'd like to get back into the lightweight category.
Lomachenko has to gain weight back to get on the easy ... then we can meet.
That's what the fans want.
Why not deliver it to them."
Lomachenko agrees.
"Box would be good for this fight."
Klimas made a request for a payment for viewing - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko should make his lightweight debut at the end of this year and meet next year with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in the match against the winner of the Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will compete for the lightweight title at the Forum Arena on 23 September.
"The match should be in the style of the cost of the audience, that's what the fans want," said Garcia, who later commented that he was open to the opportunity to broadcast the match through a television station that would come with the best offer.
"We're the main attraction.
No one else draws such attention to himself.
We'll wait for the right opportunity ..."
Garcia said he recognized Lomacko as a "amazing boxer" and could take part in his Saturday night's match.
But Lomachenko was not to be lulled by Garcia's praise when he said that the champion of the three-dollar division of Riverside looked "very slow in slow motion ... ... I'm sorry, Mike, but you're asking for a knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then boxing.
Both boxers said they felt the rising tension ahead of the mutual duel.
"You won't forget this fight.
No other game is tipping so much attention on itself.
And I will have a great delight in the fire," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It's going to be a great game."
The young couple disappeared without a trace 12 years ago.
Their car was found at the bottom of the Volga.
A pair of young Russians Ilya Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasova had been missing since December 2005.
There was an extensive search for them, but without success.
And the police eventually closed the investigation for lack of evidence.
The lost couple's families were in the dark that they would not know what had happened to the couple.
After 12 years, the sad ending of the story came.
The wreck of their car was found by a layman's diver at the bottom of the Volga River in the town of Čeboksary, Chuvask.
It was only through the documents left in the car that the officers were able to identify the couple.
The papers survived the decade underwater, without which it would take the police to find out the identities of the found for much longer.
The couple were last seen when Zhirnov borrowed a car from his father to be able to pick up his girlfriend from work.
Meanwhile, the diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his discovery to the Cheboksar police, who hauled the car to the beach the following day.
Investigators believe the young couple's death was an accident caused by the icy road leading around the river.
However, the investigation continues, with further details to be released after it is completed.
Latest test results for setting the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest test results for asylum seekers in Sweden, who have been subjected to the new age-judging method, show that over 80 per cent of people were asked as they were over the age of 18, but not everyone believes in their accuracy.
Sweden's Forensic Medical Agency (RÃ¤tttsmedicinalverket) began conducting the new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is to make a more accurate assessment of candidates in the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure was adopted after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to determine the right age of some of the refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6880 cases to investigate, and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests, conducted from mid-March to 31. July 2017.
80 per cent (2002) were judged to be over the age of 18, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency concluded that the interviewee was "perhaps over the age of 18.
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the interviewee was "perhaps under the age of 18.
Tests shall be taken only if the age of the interviewee is questionable.
According to Johan GÃ¶ransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond with the previous month.
"Compared to last month, the statistics are kept in business as usual and the figures are very similar," he told The Local.
A higher number of female applicants whose age has been estimated to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases it was found that "the person in question is 18 years or older."
Svenska Dagbladet's newspaper investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases, the respondent said he would have 18 years this year.
Criticism was also given to the medical method of age-derived, which includes X-ray of wisdom teeth and an MRI scan of the knee joints, which are then assessed by dentists and X-rays.
One of the sceptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who, among other things, researches, for assessing people's biological maturity to determine the age at which he or sheer puberty.
"I had a reason to think about this issue and I don't think these types of age-appropriate measurements are correct.
The assessment of the biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we cannot determine the age with precision, we should not pretend otherwise," Metro told the newspaper Metro.
The Forensic Medical Agency's GÃ¶s GÃransson defended the decision by saying: ‘In general, the risk of incorrect assessment of a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the person questioned is just under the age of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 per cent of all those surveyed.’
Trump threatened the president of Mexico on the phone.
In a January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Peeus Niet, US President Donald Trump threatened not to meet with him if he publicly said his country would not pay to build a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump said in the interview that funding would be arranged somehow, although he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump also spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This is according to the transcripts of interviews published by The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made the construction of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money with one of the main promises in his election campaign last year.
In his first interview with the Mexican president shortly after taking office, Trump chastised Pee Pepa undiplomatically for criticizing his plan to build the wall.
He portrayed the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't tell the press this," Trump said repeatedly in an interview on January 27, threatening to cut off contacts with the Mexican president if he continued to make defiant statements.
Funding is said to be devised and will end up all right.
"But if you say that Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to see you gentlemen anymore because that's unacceptable to me," he said, according to the US daily Trump.
He described the wall as the least important thing we're talking about, but perhaps the most important thing politically.
The executive order to build the wall was issued by Trump shortly after the takeover.
Mexico rejects the construction and financing of the 3,200-kilometer wall, which has also escalated relations between the two countries.
In late March, Trump said the project would be paid for by the United States for the time being.
Trump eventually met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's telephone interview with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The White House official called the conversation ridiculous.
He was prompted to conclude by an exchange of views on an agreement that would provide asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States of admitting those from internment facilities in Pacific Island States.
Trump at first considered the deal to be stupid, but later agreed to it.
"You can certainly say that this is not the deal you have created, but you will have to stick to it," Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, a telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump praised as a good idea as an Australian refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
Suddenly, however, the tone of the conversation escalated.
"I hate to accept these people," Trump observed.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in prison now.
"They will not be great people who will go to work for the local dairymen," he said.
He also noted in the interview that the fugitive could become an assassin from Boston in five years.
Trump conducted telephone conversations with a number of world statesmen at the end of January, about a week after arriving at the White House, often several times in one day.
He eventually called the nominee with Turnbull the least pleasant for the day.
Before he ended it, he pointed out that he had previously had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They executed the Rany killer in front of the crowd.
Her father also watched.
The execution took place in the square in the capital Yemen, Sana'a.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose as his sacrifice the little Rana Almatari who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took the girl to his father's house, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He subsequently raped her body, which he dumped near the mosque.
The violent death of a small girl has struck an entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of the 1,000-strong crowd that had come together to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
The victim's father told the media of his feelings after the execution.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's the new day of my life.
Other family members were also present, shouting with the crowd the slogan "Low justice."
The raim gun was brought to the square by a police van from which he waslé.
The officers placed him on the bowed stomach.
One of the officers turned his gun on him and opened fire at point-blank range.
The crowd in attendance celebrated every blow that had been fired.
Mr Al Almatari told the MailOnOnline website that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia law have won," he added.
I stood in the Liberation Square in Sanza, waiting to be executed by my daughter's killer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Rana's tiny little body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
I and my wife, Jamileh, are grateful that justice has been done.
Police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would become madcap for hateful madness, grabbing and lynching the killer.
The execution was ordered by a court under the administration of the Shiite Houthis.
But initially, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 lashes immediately after his arrest, but his actions aroused such outrage that the judge decided to pay for the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance. June.
Ran's family knew him well.
Police searched the basement of his home, they discovered evidence that the man had planned his actions.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could have been his motive?
An animal would be more merciful to Rana.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injuries that bore Rana's body were terrible," he told the media.
"Rana disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspaper and all our TV stations, the posters with her picture were hanging everywhere," he continued.
They all believe the police received a tip from the killer's parents, who suspected their son of the horrific act.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter's body had been found.
Rana used to play out with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We searched everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around the neighborhood, but we searched in vain.
The people of Yemen were disgusted with the crime and began to gather outside the police station where al Maghrabi was being held and demanded immediate punishment.
A representative of the Ministry of Justice read the crowd present a recording of the investigation to reassure them.
The accused did not seem to have shown remorse for his actions.
Just before his sentence, the officers read his sentence, but the convict only glanced at his executioner.
The entire event was filmed for national television, but there were many recordings posted online by the crowd.
West Virginia Governor announces change of political party
On Thursday evening, the Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced at a rally of President Trump that he was moving to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats turned their backs on me," the governor of Justice said.
"I'm announcing to you today after a long prayer and thought... today, as a resident of West Virginia, I tell you that I can no longer support you from the position of Democratic Governor."
The crowd of onlookers exploded in joy.
"I'll sign up for Republicans tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game."
Trump had previously promised people an important announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
The Justice, who according to Forbes magazine is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that the Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday night saying: "The redevelopment of the Governor Justice is yet another blow to the Democratic Party that puts obstacles in our way, rather than contributing to the upswing of our country."
"For a Democratic party that has only 15 governors and controls the fewest legislative bodies in history, the Governor Justice's announcement is the last straw for an already miserable, leaderless party, seeking in vain to find positive and unifying news," R&N chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's 'sincere' apology for doping scandal
Former outstanding athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for his sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it has not yet come as a time to return Russia to the sporting world.
The head of Russian athletics, Dmitry Shylakhtin, said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics - that the expulsion of his country from the world of sport was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all the athletes who lost their gold and silver medals in this way."
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban that came into force in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) showed that Russia had encouraged doping of its athletes.
"I think we witnessed a very frank response and presentation today," IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
"All the members of the council and congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia had admitted its mistake and was working with all its might to correct and restore the proper function of the entire federation."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia had adopted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today has been very successful and we have advanced to the next stage, but the congress supports the Emergency Staff recommendation to maintain the punishment that has been hailed on Russia," Coe added.
"We must do everything we can to stabilise the situation in the coming months.
Our effort has always been to separate honest athletes from the dishonest," he said, ending his speech.
At the World Championships in Athletics, which starts on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes who have complied with the IAAF's strict rules will compete under the neutral flag.
IAAF's chief of staff, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet several criteria before being allowed back.
Drug-taking tests are still unsatisfactory and the out-of-burns coaches continue to operate, he told reporters in London after the IAAF's presentation.
The CzechTrade state contract was awarded to the company of František Savov, whose state prosecutes.
The public contract of the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta František Savov.
Officials awarded him a hundred percent of the points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state prosecuted Savov for tax fraud and demanded his extradition to the Czech Republic.
The pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade CzechTrade announced a public contract in April for four years of provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The contract, worth a total of CZK 30.8 million, was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta of entrepreneur František Savov.
He was accused by Czech police in 2014 of tax evasion and is being prosecuted on the run.
Savov has fled to the UK and the Czech Republic is asking for his extradition.
The case was brought to the attention of Aktuálně.cz.
The award of the contract was to be decided by CzechTrade according to the original criteria of the 60 percent offered price and the remaining 40 beauty contest, i.e. the quality of the project.
It was Savov's company that was helped significantly by the latter criterion.
According to information from Dotyk.cz, she received one hundred points in all partial quality criteria.
This is what moved her in the end before another candidate, the Vltava Labe publishing house, the Elzech Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While Mladá fronta operated with an amount of CZK 404,900 per month, the VLM offered CZK 324,350.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it received a below-average rating from the assessors in all the qualitative criteria, a total of 62 points.
The tender was also attended by consultant firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which, like Aktuálně.cz, falls under the publisher Economia.
VLM filed several objections to the tender result, saying that it considered its evaluation to be unfair and insufficiently justified.
Following their rejection, it decided to challenge the competition with the Office for the Protection of Competition of the Office of the Office of the Competition.
He believes that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.
"The promoter is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of a public contract contractor on the basis of a purely subjective assessment, clearly the nominated participant Mladá fronta, a.s., to the detriment of the promoter and other suppliers," the application for the initiation of the proceedings filed at the Office this week, which was published by the news server Aktuálně, reads.
According to the CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the VLM, Michal Klíma, the scoring of the selection committee appears to be an implausible and 100% evaluation of the Young Front project for all of its members as extremely suspicious.
"Each independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors to be unlikely and suspicious," Klíma told Aktuálně.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
The CzechTrade news agency does not comment on public procurement before they are closed.
All information about the contract you mentioned is published in accordance with the Act by the Profil of the Contractor and the Public Procurement Bulletin.
"A complete written report will be published after the contract is terminated, but we cannot comment on its progress during the duration of the contract," the agency's media representative, Štěpán Dlouhý, told Dotyk.cz.
The young front responded by saying that it considers it extremely problematic that the publisher Economia hit the issue with an article in Aktuálně.cz in a competition where it has its own business interests.
However, this was mentioned in that article.
What could have helped in the tender was that she had provided the BusinessInfo portal with editorial services in the previous four years.
The contract was first tendered in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was led by Martim Kuba ODS.
František Savov is blamed by the police for tax evasion in connection with the excessive VAT deductions of his companies, which caused the Czech state to damage up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK for its extradition since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babiš, whose influence falls to the publishing house Mafra, is behind his criminalization.
A London court rejected Savov's appeal against the extradition last year, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any notice from the UK in the matter of the acquisition of the judgment's legal force to this day," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for the Prague City Prosecutor's Office, told Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to owning Mladá fronta, Savov was in the Cyprus-based Harvestor Limited, which was controlled by the Samson brewery in České Budějovice, and the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund, buying endangered assets.
He should also control the bankrupt Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the takeover of assets from the former Socialist Youth League.
The biker sped along the sidewalks and the park, ending up in somersaults.
The biker attracted attention by reckless driving around the streets, sidewalks and park paths in Úšovice.
When the patrol began to pursue him, he decided to outrun her in the direction of the Station.
"Police officers chased the man with increased caution through the city when he failed to drive on one of the secondary routes to Mariánské Lázně and drove the motorcycle into the field where he crashed," police spokesman Daniel Dvořák said.
A rescue helicopter had to arrive at the accident and transported the injured biker to the Pilsen hospital.
Officers eventually determined that the biker did not have a driver's license, the motorcycle's registration plates were stolen, his serial number honed and the actual production label removed.
It's possible the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is under further investigation.
"The breathalystimes performed were excluded at the scene of the driver's alcohol, but a test was found to be a positive result for the substance methamphetamine," the police spokesman added.
How football's financial rules will affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules restricting the funding of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar's record-breaking transfer from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by the EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play Play (FFP) rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 stipend that PSG will have to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid a sum of EUR 222 million alone to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
There are several financial terms of Neymar's transfer to France.
With the PSG team being funded by a wealthy Qatari family to make their energy sales rich, it can afford to bring Neymar into an already star football family.
Clubs can spend huge sums to buy players, but on the other hand, they have to prove legal sources of income, allowing them to cover the overheads of the business activities related to football.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after being rein with UEFA's director in 2007.
The former French player believed that the clubs that went into debt in the pursuit of new reinforcements would ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if the banks or the owners refused to secure them.
In 2011, the FFP redirected its attention from club debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with the potential and spending the hefty sums on the y players to build a global brand - was suddenly not so advantageous.
Under the current three-year trial period, which will end in 2018, the clubs may report a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platini's due out of office in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Cheferin, is committed to advocating a ban on over-reimbursement.
"The FFP rules are still in place and we are committed to strengthening them in the future," Andrea Traverso, who oversees compliance with FFP rules, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid the amount for Neymar's redemption in a one-off payment, it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the transfer can be broken down to EUR 44.4 million each year for five years.
The first wave of the FFP's highest sanctions hit PSG in 2014, along with Manchester City, owned by the Abu Dhabi group.
PSG took a €60 million ($82 million) fine - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and an order to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is wary of teams that can try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their income through companies associated with club owners.
Thus, even if the Qatari company sponsors PSG, once the funding exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the bill.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after deciding that the level of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
Part of the non-Mormar's income in PSG could be reimbursed from the World Cup Organising Commission in Qatar, according to some reports.
However, PSG and the leaders of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar have denied that Neymat should become an ambassador for the World Cup in football and that such a maneuver would be easily exposed by UEFA officials.
Previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to the unoccupied figures on Tuesday, UEFA did not launch any investigation into the transfer of Neymar to PSG.
The source of the report wished to remain anonymous as it is not authorized to comment with the PSG situation, The Associated Press reported.
The latest published accounts shows that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been made public.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and jerseys sales.
The club promises to increase its turnover by up to 30 percent from signing the contract.
Representatives of the Spanish league, apparently alarmed by the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to thwart Neymara's departure, arguing that PSG would break the FFP rules.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' by the club and the state,' said La Liga president Javier Teba to the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the PSG club by a Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's stance on the club's funding.
"This is a consequence of the ownership that has changed the football world from the ground up in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once the state becomes the owner of the club, anything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair is very difficult as the state can have different interests in the participation of such players in its club."
Spartan midfielder Rosicky: The changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on the feet.
Tomáš Rosický is going to the set.
The same sketch as in Sunday's match against Bohemians.
The Spartan midfielder stirred up the game against Cricket, devised a few goals, but his teammates did not aim for the black.
The Lethine team, pumped up with new multimillion-dollar reinforcements, thus finish after the opening double-header in the European Cup.
Was it hard to do anything else with the match after the Belgrade goal?
After the goal was scored four, which was difficult for us.
We wanted to at least not lose, to boost our confidence to have something to bounce back from in the next few games.
We had some chances.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why didn't Sparta get into the match for so long?
The game is so worked out.
The combination of the opponent was much better than ours.
We didn't get to anything, we shot out at half-time maybe one time.
That's an awful little, of course, to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we managed to play with them in the final third.
But you have to push your opponent into positions like this more often.
Is the problem a large number of lineup changes?
Of course, it's one of the pains when a new team is formed.
We only played three competitive matches and the line-up is constantly changing.
It's about the coach finding the ideal eleven to sit down.
Is it a boost for you to have played parts of two matches in a row?
They are still just parts of the match.
I don't know how my condition will evolve and when I could finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, or we can't be.
It's the same as a wound.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta has somehow decided, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came back in large numbers, but they were leaving in embarrassment.
What can you say to them?
There was an amazing visit again, just like with Bohemia.
I am so sorry that we cannot please them with a better performance.
Do something to show for which they will come next.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember such visits when I was here 15 years ago.
Can a season without the cups at least be an advantage for the league?
So far we're fighting ourselves, we're playing, so it's not such an advantage for us.
For an extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur is to serve ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of businessman Jiří Toman, who is to serve ten years in prison for tax evasion to a significant extent.
The estimated damage is CZK 645 million.
Toman argued in the complaint that the judiciary violated his fundamental rights, the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc are said to be incomplete.
Constitutional judges, however, ruled the complaint unfounded, the Czech News Agency found from the court's database.
The CPS is not another appeals court.
"It cannot, as a fourth instance, assess as a fourth instance the factual or legal errors allegedly committed by the ordinary courts if they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the order reads.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been final since November 2015, when it was upheld by the High Court in Olomouc.
At the time, Toman was in extradition custody in Argentina, where the resolution said he was also in the presidential decision-making.
The sentence imposed is at the upper limit of the statutory rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage suffered.
The High Court described the case as an extreme tax evasion that has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Servis from 2005 to 2008.
The CZK 645 million was incurred only for the period from January to July 2008, with the total leak, according to the expert, exceeding the CZK 1 billion.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to try Toman for the entire amount.
According to the indictment, World Service did not include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise duties in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, taxes paid in just the hundreds of thousands.
World Servis and some of the companies with which the company traded relate to businessman Radomír Vybíral, who was fined 13 years in prison by the judiciary for VAT machinations in fuel deals.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court some time ago.
The series "For Failure to Failure to Failure" and "Comrade Detective" play a nostalgic chord
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both the characters from the famous '80s; and for the filthy 1990's (when the geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the comedy sketch "The State" on MTV); and, of course, for the modern era, namely 2001, rather than stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd scattered to major projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and, at the same time, the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of permanent memories.
From the franchise's point of view, however, it seems that someone is running out of breath.
The "First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well - not just because of the absurd humor (an example, the story of the creation of a talking can of vegetables voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors have moved away from the main witty punch line - middle-aged actors playing horny children - and could not make fun of previous events.
The sequel to "Ten Years Later" in which adults play adults do not push the emotional plane so much, and the satire is sporadic in places, including a parody of the '90s thrillers as "The Science on the Cradle."
At one point, the character finds the junk of Apple Powerbook, roller skates and "a lot of other things from 1991" in a pile.
Many of the main storylines are repeated.
The good-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, has still not translated over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot-making that involves Ronald Reagan (also Mr Showalter), which is being encouraged by George H. W. Bush (very well-casted Michael Ian Black).
As always, many secondary stories are the best part of the franchise.
Particularly amusing to watch the eternally young Rudd with long hair, aka Matt Dillon's character from the film Youth, whose once-spectable Andy character is now behind the old peppers.
The franchise could be started by moments of casual madness, such as the returning "Seven Up" series, until it reaches what I assume will be the logical denouement: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when in the last scene the group goes to the premiere of "Léta to Fall to Resend."
Meanwhile, "Comrade Detective" appeals to another type of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of "Such Normal Americans," "Atomic Blonde: No Pity" and even the series "GLOW" in which icons of the Eastern and Western Wrestling scenes clash.
The comedy by the creators of Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanak, directed by Rhys Thomas, is intended to feature a television production: a drama about two Bucharest police officers from Romania of the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism in the manner of Marxism-Leninism.
The roles - the tenacious Gregor and the idealistic Iosf - are starring Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu The Street, which were dubbed into the English language of Channing Tatum (performing producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a wonderful idea.
Unfortunately, that's not much more than that.
Some of the jokes you laugh (like policemen watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
The series was lent its voice to many well-known actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
But "Comrade Detective" is too focused on the clumsy propaganda drama - which includes a Reagan-guzzled killer - and that's what it looks like.
Six long episodes are too long-done, and there aren't enough comedic moments.
On a shorter track, the propaganda satire in "Comrade Detective" could work, such as in the scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the US Embassy, in whose hall two fat men devour hamburgers stacked in a large pile.
A clear message for an imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgies.
The German-minded creators were not mistaken: we do so with our own culture, as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes did not see the IAAAF ban lifted.
At its congress in London, the IAAF International Athletics Federation confirmed an extension of the international ban on the start of Russian competitors due to a state-supported doping programme.
Voting in the venue of the world championship, which will start on Friday, went very clear as expected.
There were 166 delegates in favour of extending the ban, with only 21 votes against.
The main reason for the rejection is primarily the fact that Russia is failing to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-dopoping system, as the head of the IAAF Special Investigative Group, Rune Andersen, noted before the congress.
His group recommended that the ban should continue to take place.
Some of the older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of female investigators have not yet been interviewed, and coaches are still working in the country with a damaged reputation.
Neither is the Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which meets the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, yet to be fully operational.
Nevertheless, RUSADA can already carry out testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"Although progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done," said IAAF chairman Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletics Federation was suspended in November 2015, with Russian athletes losing, among other things, last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban on the upcoming World Championships, 19 Russians will participate in the upcoming World Championships, having previously proved to have been tested outside of the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.
However, they will not be able to start in the Championship in the national colours and will not play the Russian anthem in the event of a victory.
Bank of England keeps interest rate at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, followed by lacklustre economic growth and a weakening of inflation, which has choked speculation about a surge in growth.
England Bank warned that economic growth would remain "backwately" in the context of maintaining the interest rate - despite the squeezing of family budgets.
The policy figures of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the England Bank voted six to two to maintain the interest rate at 0.25%. The results of the vote for the interest rate increase supported the lacklustre economic growth, underpinned by a weak increase.
In its annual inflation report, the Bank forecasted growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that cutting family budgets would continue. The Bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the Bank indicated that growth should be increased over the next few years as a result of Brexit-induced inflation, and also said that rents on movables should increase in financial markets more than expected.
Members of the committee also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package to boost the economy, which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the Fresh Finance Plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, should start to apply from next February, although the Bank of England has said it will now offer £15 billion less than the planned £115bn.
Just before the decision, the Bank said: "The MMC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, along with pressure on real household incomes and a burden on consumption."
On the rate, the Bank said it would be necessary to "treat the cash-recognises" to soothe inflation, and this is "at a higher rate" than the markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and a further increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be "free" and "restricted."
The Bank's growth forecast for this year and the next year was down compared to 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
The projected growth in 2018 at a value of 1.8% remained unchanged.
Following the disclosure of estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision to maintain the status quo came after a disappointing increase buoy buus buus of hopes for further growth - GDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter, compared to the 0.2% of the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is expected to increase slightly towards the end of the year, according to the Bank.
The latest inflation report is a slight consolation to households hit by rising inflation and a lousy pay rise. The Bank said the situation would get worse before the increase.
The report further states that the monetary policy "cannot prevent" a reduction in revenue in the coming years, but wages are expected to rise "significantly" towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Economics should also grow because of its high interest in British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will compensate for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.025% last August in response to the shocking vote on the EU's referendum, causing the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that the full unification of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Prior to the bank's decision on the latest rates, many called for a rise in rates, along with rising inflation, which put increasing pressure on households. Three policymakers demanded an increase to 0.5% in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from June's 2.9%, even though the Bank said it had expected such a change and inflation was expected to rise again over the next month.
The Bank stated that the excess overgrading to the 2 % target was "increletely" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent crash of swap rates, it looks like the competition in the mortgage market will only rise as soon as creditors start competing for contracts to look at a good outlook towards the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who are quitting existing contracts and re-cover - there are no-fee options on offer, as are the low rates that are gaining popularity."
NHS prescribes controversial HIV drug to 10,000 patients
Patients will receive access to 'transformative' treatment for HIV prevention from September on the basis of a Supreme Court's decision to fund the NHS drug.
The English National Health Service (NSH) has announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered via the health service to approximately 10,000 patients in the three-year trial period.
The NSH agreed to finance the probationary period after the appeals court supported the Supreme Court's decision last year to say that the NHS had the funds to pay for PrEP, despite the declaration that the medicine should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, announced on Thursday, was taken by the NHS of England from the mouths of Director-General Simon Stevens as a 'significant intervention', while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a 'decisive moment'.
The Sexual Health Clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start receiving patients. Other clinics will join in October and by April 2018 there will be a full implementation across England.
Pre-posure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV.
The tests showed that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among patients at risk.
The app for the pre-sex exercise means that there are a sufficient number of specific drugs in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Patients tested include homosexuals or bisexual men, transgender people and people with HIV-positive partners who are unsuitable forfurusting.
The clinics will designate eligible participants to sign the consent to participate in the testing, including men, women, transgender people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with the GP in the UK can also sign up at their local sexual health clinic to apply for potential participation in the testing.
The program will cost the taxpayer £10 million and the NHS of England signed a contract this week to distribute the drugs following the acquisition of an international public contract.
The test period is proposed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of the PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: 'This important intervention should be replenished and fully weighted about the ever-widesclosed and increasingly successful pursuit of HIV prevention.
It's another milestone in a more than 30-year effort to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, the Executive Director of NAT (National Aids Trust) said: 'We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If the PrEP is given correctly and at risk for patients, it will offer the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
From September, the NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the need to coax the partner, which will improve the quality of many lives.
We accept this statement with pleasure.'
Ian Green, managing director Terrence Higgins said: 'The number one priority must be the rapid deployment of tests across the country; we must ensure that it is made available to each patient.
We now have the PrEP test drug available and are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people who are at risk of HIV being infected.'
Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP test period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
The evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and endangering the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
The subsequent tests will take us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of the PrEP.
It is now important that we start the tests as soon as possible throughout the country, protecting those who are exposed to HIV and together to put an end to the spread of HIV in society.'
A high life: mezzanine and smart design turned this little apartment to the Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former real estate purgator with a passionate business, swapped a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment on Earls Cour in 2014.
Located on the first floor of the Queen Anne's smart terrace - and is an illustration of the modern design that makes the most of the available space.
"I was living with my ex-husband in a much bigger house in the Knightsbridge district," Joanne said.
"I was looking for something for a more reasonable price.
I bumped into this apartment in Earls Court and had the same ceiling height.
I fell in love with him right away, and that same day I nodded to him.'
Since then, the 1,000-square-metre apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
One-bedroom apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add a storage space and an intermediate to use the high ceiling.
"I've been hollowing on high ceiling, big windows, and a lot of light.
Those were my demands,' she said.
To that end, it employed Erfan Azadi of the design and design studio Duck & Shed, based in Notting Hill, and used the nearly four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not just a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling was not enough to reach the height of two gaps climb over each other - the challenge for the architects was to create an intermediate stage to walk upright on.
Erfan had to engage in his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
"We had to arrange the two spaces so that we could walk upright.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but also bending the steel structure to correctly above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to design two full-fledged rooms on himself - while adding to the drama.
On the mezzanine, he looks down on the gorgeous living room of the old copper window frames in the Retrouvius design.
Mirror furniture in gold, silver lines and retro chandelier Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is fitted with mirrors on both sides and looks so longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to another room.
At the front door there are storage areas equipped with mirrors to store cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space, is the opportunity to separate it from the kitchen if it is not used.
The folding kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this solution, however, is the folding door.
"We had to solve the technical side," Erfan says of the reinforced veneered door.
"The children are provided with a counter-extraction to shovel very easily."
Thanks to its clever use of space and storage space, Joanne gained an additional 16 square metres, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes down to it, what you're selling is a living area - or a valuation of your property," Erfan said.
"The real estate agent basically counts the price of the apartment when he enters the apartment, based on the living area."
In this case, the living area has been increased while preserving the quality of the materials that lend the space a luxurious look.
"The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with home," Erfan added.
"You don't have the power lines in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but they will not get your hearts.'
As it turned out, a high-quality design and increase of living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you can decide to stay.
The United States is disconnecting.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has announced a ban on its citizens' travel to the state of Tennessee and seven other nations.
The state of Tennessee reproached her and retaliated a retaliatory ban on his citizens' travel to California.
Of course, it is not a ban in the full sense of the word, US citizens can travel freely in all 50 states.
This is because California has forbidden to spend government money on the travel of its citizens to eight other states, such as Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
Who will stop the madness?
California is strongly for LGBT, and considers any sign of LGBT lifestyle disapproval to be discrimination.
However, Tennessee has adopted the Conscience Reinforcement Act, according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the therapy of patients from the LGBT community is under no obligation to provide it, but he has a duty to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other nations have passed laws under which religious charities that have been given children for adoption by mothers for adoption are not obliged to provide these children for adoption to same-sex couples for adoption.
Because of these laws on conscience reservations, California banned funding for its citizens' travel to eight states from its funds.
In practice, this means that California professors must not have travel to scientific symposia in Texas, for example, reimbursed from their universities, because they are co-funded by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions to, for example, Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They must either receive federal grants for the travel, but it is absurd for the federal government to finance the travel of citizens from the state of A to the state of B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee ran out of patience, and its parliament passed a law with a resolution that it also dislikes California's high-ranking policies, high state spending, high deficits, and tolerance for illegal immigrants, but still not imposing a travel embargo on California because of it.
He's in retaliation for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to any state of the Union that would order a similar travel ban on a different state for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the facts, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt the conscience reservation laws, as well as to decide what their money will go to and what they are not allowed to do.
Second, what's wrong with conscience ado?
If the butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can't he only offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why, under penalty of punishment, to force him to sell pork when there are enough butchers offering pork?
In the state of Colorado, a baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a heavy fine for refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why not punish him and leave him alone and not order the respective cakes from the hundreds of bakers of the others?
Third, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all the citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust internal, domestic politics in the powers that are not federal, in their own way, i.e. according to the preferences of their populations.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California could be California, and Texas could be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas, and seven other states to be California, too!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought to tolerate their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of live and let live, which should be governed by all reasonable people, but by some activists, seeking not tolerance for themselves and others, but of extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them, no one must ever show moral, religious or philosophical disapproval of the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do so, it is to be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are modern enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I don't know the situation in American history, when states have made such a swipe because of political issues, except for the case of the only one.
Even in the days of the civil rights struggle for blacks, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South on the Segregation side, the states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
The only case was the 1950s, the political case of slavery, and the North-South War was about to take place.
Of course, there will be no such thing now, but the situation is nevertheless toxic.
The cultural and political divide between the states of the blue Democratic and the red Republican states is deepening, and the US is mentally disconnecting internally.
Illegal agitation.
A critic of Putin was fined in a greasy ticket.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been fined 300,000 rubles for violating the campaign rules ahead of next year's presidential election.
The court fined him for urging people to participate in the unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalny has organised two major anti-government street protests in the last two months and announced that he wanted to run for the post of head of state in March next year.
The incumbent Kremlin chief, Vladimir Putin, has not yet announced his candidacy, but he is widely expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and took him to the court.
He fined him for calling on people to demonstrate through videos posted on the online YouTube portal.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"We will pull them off the judge's salary later," the Kremlin critic joked in a Twitter post.
The Russian Electoral Commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential election because he was previously convicted of embezzlement.
Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, however, considers the relevant judgment to be politically motivated.
Failures of 300,000 rubles, or 25,000 roubles, were also imposed by the court on Thursday on Thursday by the court onwards on two members of the pre-election team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became the dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to prevent Navalny from the campaign in every way.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for robbing the Kirovles forestry business.
The verdict was upheld by the Court of Appeal in May.
The verdict is thus final, which prevents Navalny from running under Russian law.
Brothers fight over $500 million for empire
Two brothers are now, more than four decades after the empire was founded by their Italian family, to a tug of one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis resides to the Toorak estate, only three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who overturned the dispute over joint property and business assets to the supreme court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but the harsh dispute is constantly being scattered in front of the Supreme Court.
Along with their mother Anna, the brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first shop was bought by the family in 1973 at Smith Street in Collingwood.
At this point, the family founded the company Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain with 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
Other properties were purchased for the money, and the De Lutis family's portfolio now includes offices, building land in Brunswick and Sorrento, byts at the Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centres in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets, while his father, Colin, who, in Paul's words, is the "significant driver of the power and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of his assets.
The court's writings state that Colin owns $316 million worth of real estate, while Paul manages $176 million worth of real estate.
For Paul, it was the division of property and funds that became a problem.
"Colina's proposal came in his own eyes significantly in his favor," Paul wrote in an affidavit statement in court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at conciliation, the first Supreme Court session took place.
The brothers are now also competing to control the existing business - from which he claims Colin cut off.
Colin contradicts the fact that this is not true and accuses Paul of misdirection of some real estate.
In a previous affidavit, Colin said he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
"My Italian origin dictates that family is the most important thing of all," he wrote.
The cost of court appearance is rising. Hundreds of affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, are in-service attorneys, including Allan Myers, QC and defense attorneys.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and delicacies since the 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the 1970s.
With the money he acquired the property they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans business.
Colin said that when he founded Westco's "ore year of college, Paul was a little, probably 10-year-old boy."
Anna De Lutis said that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, had hoped that the transfer of property to the sons would take place in a good way.
"Luigi often used to say he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group. Colin said that Mark was compensated for $10 million and Luke $26 million in his departure.
As Paul put it, both Luke and Mark were "unfull of satisfaction with the terms of their financial compensation."
Colin has been holding back ever since, despite the fact that he is a former member of the AFL board of directors, as Eddie McGuire, a well-known TV personality and best friend, said in his 2015 autobiography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
He replied only to Colin by means of a text message in which he stated that, given the fact that the dispute was settled before the court, "I have nothing to say."
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to deal with the matter in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, in a court statement, Colin said he had tried to adapt to his brother's demands.
"Our father would be very unhappy to see our current situation," he said, adding that he was "still hoping for a successful solution."
On Friday, all hopes were in sight.
"Our disputes will be settled by court hearings anytime soon," Colin wrote.
The heat in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
Public transport drivers are getting water and summer clothes.
At the Nursery School Na Chodovci in Prague 4, where about 35 children now attend, they only go out in the morning.
The nursery is renovated after reconstruction and the planted trees do not yet provide a large shade.
There's no swimming pool, but the teachers shower in the fog.
In the afternoon, the children remain in the classrooms where the blinds are drawn and the drapes are drawn.
The air is being cooled by the air purifier because they don't have air conditioning.
It is also challenging for female teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is in the interior and exterior, exceeds the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so we should not actually have an open operation during this period," said the director of the kindergarten, Miloslava Makovičková.
There is a glass corridor in the kindergarten, where it says the temperature is around 40 degrees.
We vent the morning after 6:00 a.m., the windows close, and we have the blinds on the south sides to protect ourselves.
"But it doesn't help much," she added.
The better conditions are in the forest nursery Na Hrázi v Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have mature trees on the property, so we're underneath.
"We have a beautiful walnut tree, there's a table under it, and we do things there," said the kindergarten director Barbora Kompanová.
The teachers try to go to the woods with their children, where it is more cool.
Children's caps are wet and have various games of water on the agenda.
"We have a hand-held pressure spray that's used for flower spraying, and we use it to shower babies," Kompanová said.
The head of a kindergarten in Novoborská Street in Prague's Prosek, Jitka Vilimovská, also said that the teachers try to keep the children in the shade and sprinkle them with water.
"We have a fairly mature garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after the 3 p.m.
Every child must have a headgear.
Teachers also remind children to drink.
For example, they can choose a little sweetened tea or a diluted juice, and have a tap with water in the garden.
They also have a vegetable salad to eat each day and always have fresh fruit and vegetables to eat, which is sometimes brought to them by their parents.
"Maybe today one of my mother brought about a ten-kilo melon for the children here," Makovičková added.
Drivers get water or summer uniforms.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ionic drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
The cabs of both tram and bus drivers are in most cases air-conditioned, DPP spokesperson Aneta Řehková said.
In addition to cabins, some trams are also air-conditioned in the passenger compartment.
Tram tracks have not yet been seriously damaged by high temperatures.
Miner damage occurred in a loop in Hostivař.
At the current high temperatures, we are particularly mindful of having sufficient drinks available to drivers.
"Cleaded drinking water is available in all loops, rotation points and depot houses," said Řehková.
In the depot and in some of the alternating places, employees have so-called sodobars, which produce cooled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ion drinks.
"They can also use the summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers in their daily shifts," the spokesperson added.
The hot and dry weather of the last few days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters in the whole of the Czech Republic disposed of 108, twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, during the day, when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed above 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters were mainly busy fighting the fire.
"Fires predominate in the natural environment and also those associated with the factory works," firefighter spokesperson Nicole Zaoralová said.
The relief was not brought to the firefighters by an evening change in the weather, when the heat was replaced by thunderstorms and torrential rainfall in a number of places.
In connection with the storms, firefighters were driving out to 236 interventions.
It was mainly about removing fallen trees and branches.
"They intervened most in the Central Bohemian Region," Zaoralová continues.
But the help of firefighters was also needed in Stvolínky in Českolipsk, where they evacuated 60 people from the children's camp to safety due to the storm.
Tropical temperatures also gave work to Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, ambulances were riding out on a dozen cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from a boar.
People should therefore have their water heats checked, the rescuers warn.
Carbon monoxide is a colourless odourless gas released during imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of the poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling faint.
In case of suspected poisoning, you need to leave the infested room.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to cut back on president's media diet
Before him, many had tried, and had always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly is really going to do that.
If he is, he'll be the first.
Politico reported that the new chief of staff at the White House planned to limit President Trump's information flow - including coverage of the TV news - in the hope of keeping Trump afloat.
Here is a piece of the report by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the new chief of staff of the White House, John F. Kelly met with staff on his first day in his new job, outlining a key problem for the Trump White House, which he intends to correct: the wrong information that comes to the president's hands.
Kelly told the employees that he had to personally approve all the information - whether on paper or a common sense - because the president could make a better decision based on the right information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors cut their teeth at checking up on Trump and his media presentation.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back several decades - and now, sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
"If Trump, as a candidate, was upset by honesty stories, it was fitting to show him that a lot of other media outlets were talking about him in a positive light, which was easier to convince," said Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, to Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's tweets in check - at least in the words of the six former campaign organizers - is to make sure that Trump regularly watches the media that sing his praise on him."
All right.
But the idea that Trump's tendency to post his views on Twitter has ever been "under-control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign organizers know something that others have no idea about - that Trump's tweets would be more outrageous if they weren't checked.
The tweets Trump never sent will most likely never be known.
If his employees managed to keep him in check at least several times, then their efforts were not in for nothing.
But no one has yet been able to regularly prevent Trump from raising controversial topics.
Part of this problem is that in the White House, which consists of a rival factions, people regularly try to bolster their agenda by subtracting Trump's material - which may or may not be reliable - that support their view of the world.
In May, the Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report on the inclination of advisers to submit dubious information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information from the pen of the reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials argue that the president often reacts very angrily to negative media reports, especially reports of leaks, and he seeks to find their origin.
This situation occurred at the end of February when someone slipped the president a copy of an article from GotNews.com - the website of the provocateur Charles C. Johnson - who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being a 'source of many leaks' from the White House.
Regardless of the fact that Johnson was banished forever from Twitter for harassment; or that he did not substantiate his claim with any evidence; or that he had already published false accusations in the past and later dismissed them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House secretary Rob Porter "wanted to implement the system to manage and do the information that President Trump receives."
Would it work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to push through the same strategy.
He may turn out to be a more efficient manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness doesn't just fade, and his helpers still compete for power.

Tourists negotiate a ditch and a return to the 'Millionaire's Quarter'
The few of the most affluent homeowners in West Midland, England, are once again embarking on a run-in with determined tourists who are negotiating with the local authorities to re-granchise the field for their headquarters.
Tourists have parked 20 caravans in a field at a flourishing street in the city of Solihull, which is dubbed the 'militia's Quarter.'
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, tourists return after being banished in May. They were not afraid of the trench, which was dug at the scene under the authorities' orders to prevent their incursion.
The tactical group found gaps in defence and penetrated the field of caravans with the unprotected gap that served the journey.
Frequest residents of the district attacked the city council of Solihull, saying it was 'not capable of solving the problem'.
One of the residents who wished to remain anonymous said, 'They'd raised the place on Monday night after they'd been moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw rocks at other people.
The Board of Directors should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists had been moved to a different place and now they'd come back.
More arrived last night, and I guess more will be reached today.'
She added that: 'The Birmingham Board of Trustees knew how to deal with this problem. He uses court orders to protect the parks.
I'm on Streetsbrook and I'm not going to pay my taxes any further until the board of trustees has reached out to the tourists.'
Another of the anonymous residents said, 'It's ridiculous. We were just the other day following the last away tourists, and now they're back.
And this time there are even more of them, and this time they brought the horses with them.'
The press spokesperson for the city's board of directors of the city of Solihull said: 'We are aware of the unauthorised stay on the property near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with the local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to resolve the problem to succeed.
To gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many locals as possible report any unsociable or unlawful conduct by the police at number 101.
We'll get the overall picture we're going to deliver in court.'
The MEP's husband was hit by a car in Brussels.
He was brought in by a government special.
A government special brought the injured Róbert Zhitňanský to Bratislava on Wednesday after noon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and he was under the constant control of Slovak doctors on board the aircraft.
The long-planned flight went without complications.
Róbert Žitňanský, according to TV JOJ, had a serious accident in Brussels earlier in the summer.
He said he was hit by a car and has been in serious condition ever since.
After being transported to his homeland, he was transported to a specialist workplace of one of the Bratislava hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of the NOVA Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanská.
She would not comment on the incident.
The couple have three children together.
Italians clamp down on NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue ships arriving at the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean if the NGO does not sign new rules regulating their operations.
"If the NGO does not sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue their operations," said Home Secretary Marco Minniti in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities were seized by a German rescue organization, Jugend Rettet, on suspicion of human trafficking, significantly ease illegal immigration.
The rescue organisation, which is in its first year, declined to comment on the allegations against Italian prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosiose.
"For us, saving human lives is and always will be the number one priority. We are therefore very sorry that we cannot currently operate in the rescue zones," the organization said in a social media statement.
"We can only comment on any current accusations after gathering all the information and assessing the situation."
Italian authorities have been following the Jugend Rettet Iuventa ship since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on the boat, handed over directly by traffickers to them, repeatedly.
At least one meeting was attended by the applicant's file, it was reportedly only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya. The course of the meeting was published by Italian media.
The ship's crew is suspected of breaking the law and circumventing the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees the rescue operations in the area - of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-profit-making non-profit organisations involved in the rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, Malta's MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter organisation said on Thursday that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable as they were not a "substantial change or obstacle" with regard to the rescue operations.
The adoption of the new code of conduct was also rejected by Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which is the Nobel Prize winner.
Minniti, meanwhile, has been quoted as saying that the sharp drop in immigrants in recent weeks landing in Italy as part of the rescue operations suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperate with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He also unveiled plans for further negotiations this month to be held this month with the mayors of Libya on the economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Shameyless Mesarošová: Silicone and cellulite crawled from the jumpsuit!
The hot summer days are all to be tempted to wear only the essested of the most necessary to cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesarošová does it the other way around.
The afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where the actors, presenters, singers and all those with dealing with TV Prima were swarming, she was swarming her little one in a mini-transaction.
And all it took was a few of the usual moves, and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her bottom.
Overalso many times he cut between the halves, and it was so high that it had to be adjusted all the time.
She certainly had no shortage of the attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages urging Conrad Roy's suicide
The woman from Massachusets was sentenced to prison for a height of two years for inciting her friend to commit suicide via text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve 15 months of her two-year sentence behind bars and then spend five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June for the involuntary killing of Conrad Roy, who took his own life. July 2014.
Roy's father testified in court on Thursday, "The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left free until the decision was made.
She faced up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy had suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter stood in place at the announcement of the verdict with tears in her eyes, her hands on her eyes and her eyes pointing to the ground.
"Her conduct has killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the judge.
"She ended his life to relieve herself.
She could not accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She didn't feel any remorse."
Carter's attorney, however, said it was "unfortunate circumstances he deeply regrets about."
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that "her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder do not have a significant impact on its actions."
The applicant read out the statement by Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, "It will not pass a day for me not to squander the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters and we will endure the immense pain together that we will carry with us forever," the statement read.
Roy's sister Camdyn Roy testified that she was "froning" to be watched by the knowledge of never attending her brother's wedding and never be his children's aunt.
"The loss of the man I've seen since I was born is the pain I'll carry with me for life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a valid law to sanction a person facilitating the suicide of another person. The present case therefore sets a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found in the 2014 car seat, poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case drew the attention of the entire nation after the text messages from Carter, which instigated suicide, were released.
"You're hanging out of the building, or stabbing, I don't care," the text messages Carter had sent just two weeks before his death while Roy was on a family vacation.
A few minutes before she was a suicide, she wrote to him, "You have to do it, Conrade," and "you just have to get the generator on and you'll be single and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter had longed to receive attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from any press comments.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, she was acquitted of the charges.
Miss Knox (30) published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Audi to modify up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just a day before the Audi announcement, BMW, the carmaker, said it would offer its customers software updates to more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW's chairman said the company believed that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, which are the headquarters of BMW - that are considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would adjust three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have largely promoted the use of diesel atomobiles in Europe and the United States to comply with the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of automakers to install equipment to neutralize the gas issued by diesel engines is being increased, making it more expensive for cars to become competitive.
While German car manufacturers are facing close searches, Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing accusations of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which, in an effort to meet the emission limits, installed software in its cars, which in testing reduced the amount of emissions issued but was deactivated under normal conditions.
Several senior Volkswagen officials have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the engine development department in Audi would be arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and therefore not covered by the extradition, so he may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi joined a criminal investigation by the German police in the case of the car maker Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emission limits - extending the charges facing Audi in the US.
Audi's inclusion in the investigation may have a detrimental impact on Volkswagen: luxury carmaker makes a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The plane made an emergency landing on the beach.
The man and the little girl were killed.
The accident took place on the beach of Praia de São in the Costa da Caparica area, some 30 kilometres south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses told the TV channel SIC Noticias that the plane had been flying just over people sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people from the beach reportedly ran from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape from the machine.
The beach, according to local media, was killed by a 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl.
"The plane hit them and they were dead at the scene," local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias described.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both of whom escaped the accident alive and the officers took them away for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
And are highways in the Czech Republic even complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It's unbuilt, even though it started to be built in 1978.
Even if it's unfinished, it's constantly being repaired.
And it's not allowed to be built any further, even if it has a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, the Hradec Highway D11.
Construction of another of its sections was newly stopped by the Children of the Earth movement for at least a few months.
We East Bohemians get the highway in pieces like when you cut salami.
The wheelbarrow is being cut, and then we'll see when or if we'll get any more.
Yet we don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the journey time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or Poland from villages and towns.
Endless streams of trucks go directly through the towns of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not sensible to go around.
But the last section of our dream highway was put into operation in 2008, an incredible nine years ago.
Not a knock since.
That's why the remaining four kilometers of unfinished section to Hradec Králové and on other sections to Jaroměř started to be built recently with an archaeological survey, with construction starting at the end of this year, you could hear the loud banging of junkets in the eastern Czech Republic.
I mean, no one believed it anymore.
Last week it was revealed that construction would not be built this year.
And maybe not even next year.
The Earth-Club Children movement for sustainable transport from Brno has filed a decay.
Earth's children are repeating their D1 tactics.
They challenged the building permit decision in its entirety.
In the appeal, they request a review of all binding opinions of all the institutions concerned already issued.
For example, the Municipality of Hradec, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Authority.
So far, we are descending from the D11 near the village with the eloquent name of the Burial Starring.
So we get down, we just drive down the highway and suddenly we're standing on a side road, preferring to subsequently line up in the column.
The worst thing is that you see such stories all over the country.
A scary, constantly clogged road to Benešov, the D1 or D8 motorway.
Everyone has their Funeral.
What do the Children of Earth demand?
What is the nature of the problems of building roads in the Czech Republic?
And why is the motorway network virtually in the incomplete system?

Lavender of Provence threatens climate change
The Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in the area of southeastern France, but are now at risk from climate change.
Lavender is declining as a result of dry climates and harmful insects, causing consternation to the faces of researchers and farmers seeking a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence said: "The cultivation of lavender in Provence is at risk because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change brought about by less precipitation in spring and autumn.
This affects the lifespan of the lavender.
It is also the fault of the cicadas and grasshoppers carrying the micro-bacteria that thrive in the dry climate."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists, and the oil that is made of them is an important component of perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, "Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The quantity of oil obtained from these lavenderings is, of course, less.’
A possible solution may be a more efficient distribution of water and a slowing of evaporation of water from the soil, but also spray the lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and the breeding of more types resistant to dry weather.
Journalist murder highlights mounting threats in Mexico
Riodoce staff regularly gathers every Wednesday to discuss news of the riots taking place in the Sinaloa area involving organised criminals, corrupt officials and relentless drug wars.
Today, however, under the strain of recent events, it is mainly for the sake of its own safety.
They learn that it is important for them to change their habits.
Two deserving journalists talk about what would be safer: to take their children with them to the office that was attacked with a grenade in 2009 or left at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the black board: the opponents, the neutral, and the allies.
They'll ask journalists to give names to every word - no evidence is needed, just use the imagination and premonition.
It is something to choose from - drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose job it is to cover up criminal conduct.
The violence continues and the bodies pile up in a pile across the country; journalists among them are constantly increasing: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 have been to power since President Enrique Pena Nieto came to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection following attacks and threats; and seven have been killed in all seven states this year.
Among them are the co-founder of the Riodioce periodical, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on the violence associated with the drug trade.
His loss is noticeable, although his presence is all-income - a large photograph of Valdez with the inscription "Justice" on which he points his middle finger, hangs in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - are over 30 years old, wearing a T-shirt with a photograph of Valdez with a smile on their faces, glasses on their noses and a cap of Panama.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists speak of mutual trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to address the cases of journalists, so far, according to the Committee's comments on the protection of journalists, it has so far sued two suspects.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime. The journalists' murderers are thus very rare to take to court.
Journalists from Riodoce insist that they report on the violence that is happening in the Sinaloa; even though they are the destruction of the grief and the area is now very treacherous.
Without information about the killers and without the vision of justice, the security meeting is no purpose, says Ibarra.
"It's foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, no one can be trusted."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the headquarters of Riodo in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to drive several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 rounds, apparently because of the title of the article - which can be translated as the Twelfth River.
The shooters then boarded his car and crashed him not far from the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
In Culiacan, the rumors seem to spread fast.
In Valdez's case, however, it is a suspicious silence.
Since Guzmán's arrest and his January extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefielders as the rival faction tries to fill an empty space.
Several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi every day, and the cemetery is filled with embroidered two-story mausoleums for drug churches, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word "fire" thinks that one drug cartel is controlled by a coastal state with precious ports and important routes that drugs travel to the United States.
The upstart, as well as the fact that Valdez was familiar with the risks of his job, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce still rescues that he did not protect his friend.
He believes two misconduct contributed to his death.
The first was the February edition of the interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that fought the war with Joaquín Guzmán's sons.
The peace could have billed the sons; the suspected gang members had bought up all copies of the newspaper the moment they landed on the shelves.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the confiscation of other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight between Mexican criminals against journalists.
He had managed to survive so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that this would never change.
He was a virtual veteran in the Noroeste periodical when he decided to sell his $50 shares in 2003 and start with five colleagues Riodoce.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism and not mention the drug trade," said Bojorquez.
Riodo, over time, had earned a good reputation for his brave and truthful news; the newspapers had begun to do well.
Journalists liked to go into the search for troubled topics and published texts without censorship - the reader was fascinated to read stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodo won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot for its coverage of Latin America.
For the same year, Valdez won the International Freedom of the Press of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his brave reporting on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I was afraid for my life," he said as he accepted the award.
Droredling in Sinaloae is a "condem" of life, Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October last year.
"You have to take on the role of journalist - or play dumb.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of death . . . why didn't you say what was going on?'.'
Riodo employees miss Valdez. The man was known for his joking and his indiscriminate language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
They all relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He would often go to the El Guayabo Bar across from the offices and sit at the same table.
Now they ask: was this routine caused by his death?
His death also raised questions about their own assumptions - how to do their job as best as possible and stay alive?
"They don't like getting involved with their wives, children, clean shops, secret landings."
"These things were forbidden," Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You must trust your instincts.
If you feel something's wrong here, hands off.
The trouble is, Riodoce's editor Andres Villarreal said, that "lick is a sense that can be fooled . . . and then the thing with Javier happened."
The old rules, he said, as with the others, no longer apply in Sinaloae - as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling trails, weak governments, and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where Riodo employees meet; a few days ago, spyware was discovered, which was purchased by the governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Outside the building, two police officers find relief in the forty-degree heat in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect the Riodokou offices, located in a four-storey building in the Culiacan bourgeois district.
Journalists are making fun of whether these police officers are one of those 50 percent of the law's protectors who, according to the government, are corrupt.
It has been months since journalists made their last trips to the mountainous areas that are essentially controlled by drug cartels.
There are three major stories on this week's schedule.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio Caesar Chávez in Sinaloe.
They are also post-intended to suspicious government expenses that took place in the state's hometown of the governor's hometown.
There were also several abductions recently in one of Culacán's most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor's office.
Officially, no one reported the identity of the abducted people or the circumstances surrounding the kidnapping, so journalists were wary of writing about what every city's occupants knew: that the restaurant was a favorite destination for drug traffickers and politicians.
One journalist read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name that is associated with a politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) controlling all levels of the political scene for almost the entire last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been charged with corruption in senior positions.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about earlier incidents that had taken place at the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaquín's sons, "El Chapo" Guzmán, had escaped the army's strike force.
A month ago, readers would have read about the subject in Valdez's section, which was the best source of information about the abductions.
"Walherez would have solved the case," said Villarreal (46), nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slim figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office was turned into a warehouse for signs and labels to protest protest workers. Employees certainly did not expect them to become press-related activists.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and set off the following morning to demonstrate in front of the Attorney's office for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
Only the charred body was discovered. Authorities say it's an Adamea based on DNA analysis.
Journalists' activity is escalating across the country. Many of them organize the protests and scribble on the sidewalks and buildings "SOS printing."
The director of the newspaper Bojorquez is the day on a visit to Washington, where he seeks international support and get justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with the Sinaloa Governor, the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of stalking journalists and their murders for proclaiming the truth.
In the meantime, she requested to be transferred to another department for fear that her anger could threaten her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are "bean" organised crime, corrupt officials and indifferent public.
In his latest book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that journalists die not only at the hands of the drug cartels, but also on the order of politicians and security forces who collaborate with organised crime.
The media overseas agency group Articulo 19 has charged police and public officials with more than half of all attacks on journalists.
"You'll die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez added.
The murders are obviously working.
No one will forget the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macías, who took place six years ago at the northern border of the Tamaulipas.
Her body was found with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas Cartel: "I ended up doing this about my reports."
Next to the severed head was a keyboard and headphones.
Some branches have decided to shut down, such as the newspaper El Norte, based at the northern border of the state of Chihuahua, in response to the March murder of the March intelligence correspondent Miroslava Breach.
The others are still going on, just as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the killing of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the public drug cartels with an article on the opening page entitled "What do you want from us"?
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across the border.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding work in exile is difficult, as well as getting rid of the feeling of being haunted all the time.
And journalists are persecuted and killed, such as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruze.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their jobs, every day poses a major risk.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet, once admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is heading to hell, that's why I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday's midnight, and Riodo's staff are sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest issue sent to the printer - drinking beer when the phone suddenly starts ringing.
They learn that a shootout between the gang members and police officers near the beach resort in the town of Mazatlán left 19 people dead.
The war is escalating, just as many of the messages left by the syndicate members in the area promised.
Journalists are releasing this news from a mobile phone on the Riodo website.
Not a day goes by and the opening headline is changing again.
The sounds of the police sirens point to another shootout.
Bojorquez casts a glimpse of the police patrol to see if he was paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't show it.
Under the vast portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical - whose middle finger is an eloquent slogan for the whole of Sinaloe - all Riodo staff follow his steps.
"How could we possibly think of leaving," Bojorquez said, "when an intern asked me to take to the streets on the same day that Javier was killed?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however terrifying.
The researchers have now revealed the findings of the first discovery of an amazing rhino-sized creature whose perfectly preserved remains - which the experts have called 'Mon the Purpose of the Dinosaurs' - were found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a high degree that the experts were able to determine the reddish-brown color of his scaly skin and said that the dinosaur had a 'problem past'.
The article in the journal Current Biology stated that it was 'the most preserved armored dinosaur found so far and one of the best species of the dinosaur in the world'.
The fossil is a new species of the family of Nodosauridae. The dinosaur lived during the Ched period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked the researchers, who described him in the words of 'reconceiving remarkable.'
The armored whitewash is, according to National Geographic, the best preserved fossil of its kind to date.
Shawn Funk is behind the discovery, which revealed the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He came across what appeared to be a foreign object and decided to explore it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working to uncover the animal from a huge chunk of land weighing 1100 kg.
When the work is completed, the dinosaur is ready to be revealed.
'Just squint your eyes a little and you'll believe he's asleep,' said Caleb Brown, head of the work, and the museum's naturalist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is on display.
'It will certainly go down in history's history as one of the most beautiful and most accomplished dinosaur species - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.'
Studying his skin, the researchers found that this herbivore - despite being covered in armor and resembling a walking tank - was very likely facing a serious threat from the eccentric dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a cloaking system used by many animals today.
Experts say it allowed him to merge with his surroundings and avoid his enemies. The cloaking system suggests that it was a popular diet of larger dinosaurs.
Reports of the 110 million-year-old dinosaur of the Nodosauridae family first appeared in newspapers in May. It is currently available for inspection at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers gave him the name Borealopelt markmitchelli after the museum's technician, Mark Mitchell, who, along with the team, spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering the fossil.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of the fossil, dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and the shape of scales and armor all over the body.
They revealed the cloaking method commonly used by today's animals in defence - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this camouflage effect is common in nature, the researchers' findings are surprising, as Borealopelta's size far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that the dinosaur was so many predators that evolution preferred to camouflage in survival.
Many of the current animals with camouflage - such as deer, zebras and or an armisp - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the nosodaurus had to literally fight for its outdated.
'The presentation of the vast and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the danger posed by the predators in the Cradle period,' Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic ingredients contained in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur skin was probably red-brown in colour.
Researchers continue to study the animal, searching for further knowledge of his life, including the preserved stomach content, to track down his last meal.
He believes the dinosaur fell into the river after death and was carried into the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
The Alberta region was at the same climate at the time as in today's Florida, and the rivers, and the oceans stretched much farther inland than they do today.
'This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in a perfectly preserved scaly skin while being preserved in three dimensions, and we can see its original size,' said Brown.
'For these reasons, the animal looks virtually the same as it did in the Cretaceous.
You don't have to use your imagination to rebuild it; just turn a little to squint your eyes and it seems like he's just sleeping.'
In the Cretaceous period, the Earth was viewed by giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs who moved on two legs.
Though the king of all the dinosaurs - the Tyrannosaurus rex - lived for several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur might have been a favorite prey for his equally fearsome ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, the 11.5-metre-long monster weighing over 6 tons.
Researchers whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelt's body was flown into the sea after it was mummified in the mud.
The find behind the discovery is Shawn Funk, who uncovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at a Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armour, which is also complete from the nose to the hip.
The animal was 5 metres in diameter and weighed up to 1,300 kg.
From his shoulders protruded two 50 cm spines.
Researchers believe this herbivore was a furnace of the territory of today's Canada until it ended up in a river that washed it into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, 'finding such a preserved individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the shocking the find seems to me.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side lies his right fore leg, with his fingers pointing up.
I'll count the scales on his foot.'
How did one activist learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shuddered all over her body.
The day after she arrived in New York, the St. Louis sat on the Airbnb bed and went through the Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across a contribution from a high school student.
"Police just shot an 18-year-old man whose body is still lying in the street," he said.
She was surprised that no one else had written to her the post, so she closed down Facebook and opened up Twitter.
User @ThePharoah kept her wall posting.
A rapper from St. Louis posted on Twitter his posts about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was shot by a white female police officer in the city of Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photograph of Brown's body lying limply in the street, where he had not been taken away after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put down the phone to return to it the night she watched tweets about people who were gathering on Canfield Drive.
She watched photographs of police tapes and screaming people. One of the men claimed to be the victim's father and was holding a sign that read "The Hurers' Police killed my unarmed son"!
She watched the live news - one of the policemen standing in front of a group of protesters holding a leash and a barking dog at the other end.
In another video, another policeman was, she put it, holding a gun with which he pointed at the crowd, yelling, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
"It's not normal," said Ferrell.
"This isn't the type of murder we've gotten used to and that we can call a normal one.
I could smell the creeps all over my body.
"I was angry and I cried."
She immediately booked her return flight and travelled home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years is described by the new documentary "Whose Streets?," which will be released in theaters on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and resistance, the strength and the resilience told from the point of view of the people living in the community who take to the streets and demand answers.
On her way to Ferguson, Ferrell took a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a floral jersey and the same floral headband - on a subject they've discussed many times before - "about the experience of blacks."
"Do you remember how I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" he recalls of the interview.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old and that's not the right thing to do."
"It didn't come to any consideration for not taking her with me," Ferrell said later.
"Today's events are the climax . . . that have occurred in the past.
She had to know and see it for herself and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organizing, but she also had to experience the difference between the different layers of experience with blacks and what we need to do to free ourselves.
Despite being able to provide conditions in which she does not experience racism firsthand, she is no different in any way from another black child-woman.
I sense that if I had protected her from this experience, I would only have harmed her."
After arriving in Ferguson, the first stop on the south Florissant Road across from the police department, which became the base of activists awaiting the words of Officer Darren Wilson about his eventual involvement in the incident.
Here, Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who was preparing meals for the rest of her.
Together, they prepared food for the bags and helped deliver it to Protestants.
Ferrell's eyes began to slowly give birth to a new type of activism.
"My activism was turned upside down after August 9th," Ferrell said, adding that while attending college, the University of Missouri-St. Louis was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn association and sought to introduce healthcare and food in black communities.
"I had no experience with the organization.
It was only natural."
A few weeks later, during the evening demonstration, Ferrell met the later co-designer of the documentary, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" the ongoing events only.
But Ferrell thought, "Are you working on a documentary or are you trying to find a story to be used?"
Such a type of skepticism penetrated the community through many people, often whites, who wanted to make a profit of pain and decisiveness.
As Folayan explained in the non-saturated interview, "We have heard that the voices of the people who are born and raised in Ferguson are very often neglected, and we wanted to change that."
Folayan has already established a collaboration with co-director Damon Davis, who is a respected local artist who deals with the subject of prisoners on death row.
She also participated in the project was intailed by Ferrell and, along with six other locals, who were watched by the "Whose Streets" team in the years following the assassination of Brown.
"Nobody speaks for us in this documentary, but it's our statement," Davis said.
"That was important to me - how these people were represented - because I would be represented in the same way."
While the purpose of the documentary was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an attempt to depict that the movement is not about the savior's leader, but about the rapprochement of the community," Folayan said - it turned out that she was the most explicit to taking part in filming.
The documentary "Whose Streets?" describes the very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, for example, how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face at the thought of the first moment when she saw the final version of the documentary.
"But I understand that in order to do this job and humanise the blacks, I have to open up."
In addition, Ferrell's story highlights the role of the eccentric black woman in the broad side of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who formed the campaign under #BlackLivesMatter in response to the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on social media - call themselves the weirdo.
"Fresh eccentric women in leadership positions are ultimately behind the movement's preservation," Ferrell said, "because we're constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must endure the weight of these events."
Folayan agrees with this statement, adding that "the movement is in fact supported by black women and a large number of eccentric black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not a mere aphirmatic affair" and Ferrell is not the main heroine of the documentary for her views.
"That is what she was the driving force and the source of energy," she said.
"that she, of all alone, was not a coincidence in the front lines, because life at these intersections in the skin of a black eccentric woman is dangerous.
You can feel the energy rush in front of the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the TV station's cameras have cleared out their positions, but the heavy racial tilts between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is serving two and a half years' probation for blocking the highway in demonstrations.
The socially political atmosphere in the area, which she called home described as "The Order."
Yet she continues to take up her quest, which she has committed to since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
All we have to lose is our chains."
A field was on fire on Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters went to the scene, and a helicopter helped.
Nearby Český Brod in Cologne, between Bylany and Liblice, a field of about 15 hectares was on fire from 14:00.
The fire stopped spreading at about 15:15, with firefighters issuing a third fire alarm out of four possible.
According to fire department spokesman Ladislav Holomčík, the fire was also helped to extingueter from the air by a helicopter.
At 18:00 firefighters managed to extinguish the fire, the fire caused damage for CZK 700,000.
The flames at the scene were fought by dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters.
The fire was caused by a technical fault in the engine compartment of the harvester.
The fire was also assisted by a helicopter, which carried out a total of six drops of water.
"We handed over the site of the intervention to the owner until 8:00 tomorrow, he will be guarded by a volunteer fire brigade," Holomčík said today.
And Becoming Resemblance: Artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of one of the rooms of New York's Fridman Gallery, several faces are placed in several faces of different skin shades - white, black and dark - suspended from the ceiling on the wires. Each of them was the spitting image of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the oral and hair excursions sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for illegally releasing secret cabalgrams to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on 2 August, is entitled A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines her experience with technology, computer science, and Manning - a transsexual and a pioneering dissident whose punishment was reduced by Obama three days before his departure as US President.
An algorithmic analysis of Manning's DNA and using 30 portraits to illustrate what a man would look like with this genotype, the Dewey-Hagborg made a razor-shaped, if not intellectual, commentary on DNA pliability - as well as the many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, as well as identities.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, had spoken from her youth about considering herself a woman. She was convicted in 2013 on the basis of 20 indictments, including violating six espionage laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photographs were held by prison staff. Only one, lower-quality black-and-white photo of Manning, visibly concerned, has leaked to the publicity in the driver's seat in the platinum blond wig with which she is now associated.
In 2015, the positive reactions to the 2012 Dewey-Hagborg project were still in for the start-up to Stranger Visions.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic items - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create an image of the possible forms of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were preparing an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to complete the article with a portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained at the opening of the new exhibition.
However, no visits or photography were allowed, so they contacted Chelsea asking if they would be interested in the DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse were made friends within two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, who presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could take part in the exhibition in person.
Indeed, a few days after the release of the comic, President Obama asked for Manning's release, a welcome change after several unbearable years in the military prison in Kansas.
Indeed, it is interesting that the exhibition takes place at a time when Donald Trump is waging war on people who are seeking to publish government information and transgender soldiers, while trying to find new ways to incite resentment with his tweets in the areas he should support.
In response to a question about this particular timing, Dewey-Hagborg stated that "everything is happening for some reason."
Under the statement of the artist on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls with her huge signature (the letter "i" in the surname is leaked to the heart) after the end of the "samoocial factionalism, which is based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite side are the sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - the centipede of the letters C, G and A recorded with a tuch.
By classifying 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist's sophisticated scientific vocabulary), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least in terms of biological, we are all to each other.
"I hope that people will take the fall from this, that our genome doesn't matter who we are, and that the genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it their own way," Dewey-Hagborg said. Her 2007 work Spurious Memories on the subject of video is also on display.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last copy of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the graphic amendment mentioned above.
It depicts Manning emerging in the manner of King Kong from the United States Disiplinary Barracks prison with a megaphone in his hand.
"As soon as they prevent you from speaking, they will win," it reads.
"Never be forgotten to silence."
"It's a direct transcript from one of the letters," the Philadelphia artist said.
"I think about it, I get goose bumps."
Manning has not yet personally visited the exhibition - which was foretold in a comic book - but when she does, she will be greeted with the rooms on Wednesday with her masks, her own genomic effigies, lined up as a mob of Protestants.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including the nearly 160 cm tall statue of Maning, on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded in pencil.
"They were placed on the walls in the past, but this time I wanted the feeling of the crowd to glow," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted to give the impression of a mass movement that takes on the form of Chelsea and liberates it."
University of West West and University of Oxford employee sought for murder
These days, a nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at the Northwest University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who are being prosecuted on suspicion of the murder of a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
An arrest warrant was issued for the first-degree murder for a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged complicity in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleaua, the Cook County forensic file says.
The document states that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died from several stab wounds.
Chicago police said the deceased's body was found on November 27. July.
The officers were notified by telephone to this fact. Arriving at the Grand Plaza Apartments, the victim was found in one of the apartments with several lacerations.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and detectives are investigating the case as a homicide. Meanwhile, police are searching for the two suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has worked as associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northwest since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of the University of Public Relations, said in his email statement that Lathem is now on an administrative vacation and has been banned from entering the university's school premises.
"The full matter is now being investigated by the relevant authorities and the Northwestern University is cooperating fully with them," said Cubbage.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the University of a Somerville College said in a statement sent by email: "We have been contacted by the British police and we are ready to assist the US police as well."
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were shocked by the fact and they wish he had come forward to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, the public relations chief of police at the Chicago Police Department said he was urging the suspects to surrender to the relevant authorities.
"The police have information about their whereabouts, and the effort to find the suspects is escalating," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are assisting the police in the search for the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the Grand Plaza manager, who was alerted to the events that were to take place in apartment No. 1008.
Police described the scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear if the incident occurred on the 27th. July.
He added that Lathem and Warren were caught on security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," said Guglielmi.
Grand Plaza management issued a statement to all residents: "Police are now working on compiling a time-trial and profile of the victim and investigating various themes, including domestic violence."
"We will complete WADA Plan in the near future" - Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the rest of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria and a re-constitution of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will be implemented.
"Apart of the criteria of the new plan have now been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
With this fact, the WADA plan has been updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The vice-president commented on the second part of the WADA Plan to uphold the Code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, the Code contains nothing that should be of concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented as well.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned calls for a public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation under investigation by Richard McLaren to the government about the alleged sponsorship of Russian athletes' doping.
On this topic, Mutko said: "We are conducting an investigation, as our anti-doping system has clearly failed.
All measures were taken.
However, there were no state programmes in our country and we cannot confess to something that never existed."
Mutko's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russia's RSport, Smirnov, he admitted the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, but added: "On many occasions, we said that the report contains controversial attitudes and regulations.
No one is planning to accept the report with no reservations," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADU of taking doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
Nevertheless, the organization allowed the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) in June this year.
After a visit to the organization's Moscow headquarters in July, WADA CEO Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA was "on the right track" to restore validity.
Police charged three people, one is a juvenile.
Police charged three men with the establishment of Wednesday's fire at a rare wooden church in Třinec-Guts in Frýdecko-Místeck.
One of the accused is a juvenile, all three are of Czech nationality.
The offence of general endangerment carries up to 15 years in prison.
The Moravian-Silesian Police Director Tomáš Kužel told reporters today.
It was, he said, a deliberate crime.
"This is a very recent matter and the police are currently working on the motive for the matter," said Cone.
He said the police would discuss the possible remission of the accused.
Further information, according to the director, is not possible to disclose.
"I can't say any more yet, because the criminal police and investigation services and the prosecutor who is supervising the matter are actually working on the matter," Cone said.
The wooden church of God's body in Guts dates from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original furnishings and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
The material damage will run into tens of millions of crowns, according to preliminary estimates, but the historic loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, the church was considered for the restoration.
Most of the costs should be covered by the insurance policy, the additional costs are ready to be shared with the Ministry of Culture and the city, a public collection is also being prepared and a contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parishes, is expected.
A similar wooden church of St Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová was also destroyed by a fire 15 years ago.
It was caused by an electrical fault at the time.
In its place, an exact copy was made.
The state counts on the citizens in defending the state.
They will support their training.
With financial support for associations usable in defending the state, voluntary shooting training or a team of training trainers, the law on the readiness of the citizens' readiness for the defence of the state is foreseen.
The Ministry of Defence, which has been tasked with its elaboration by the government, promises to increase the physical fitness of Czechs and their abilities, which could then be used by the state in crisis situations.
This follows from a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were adopted in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support the conscription.
The basic objective of the proposal, according to its authors, is to create an effective system that would help to increase the readiness of the population of the Czech Republic to defend the state, apart from the executive conscription and on the basis of volunteering.
For example, the state would support amateur amateur associations, shooters or cynologists with financial or material, and would make it possible to increase the capabilities of their members.
In return, he would get data about people who are willing to come to the country's aid in a time of crisis if necessary, and their skills or material equipment.
There could also be accredited instructors to assist the associations and other candidates in training or training.
It is also expected to organize sit-downs with war veterans or people who have acted heroically.
One possible option assumes that a new office would be created to administer and coordinate the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that people's participation should be voluntary and the state would use their capabilities only after the state of emergency is declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual blurring of previously obvious boundaries between the different types of threats," the project reads, referring to the danger of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministry officials noted that it was therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible set of capabilities, not just the military ones.
"The basic aim of the intention is to create a very broad base that allows every citizen to respond in a qualified way to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, or to contribute to the protection of others, and by wrongly not to make it difficult for the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic to be carried out," the intention states.
Adopting the law would bring substantial financial demands.
According to the ministry, their amount will depend on the option chosen.
For example, the Office expects financial support for projects to prepare citizens to defend the state up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were set up, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million per year.
More money would go to salaries or to build an information system.
The proposal also foresees that the remit of the regional military headquarters would have to be expanded, employing an additional 42 soldiers.
Ministry officials have previously said that the law should also help resolve the opposition of some Czech politicians to the introduction of a European Union directive on the possession of weapons.
Its adoption would allow the shooters who would be part of the system to retain some of the weapons that the directive is forbidden.
Startups to help your company not become another Uber
Amy Errette wanted to measure the satisfaction of her e-commerce startup's employees, but she could not find the appropriate survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, unhelpful, or even deceptive.
And while promising to be anonymous in the survey, some employees expressed their distrust of the entire process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, owner of e-commerce of the saliv care company Madison Reed, based in San Francisco, which employs 75 people.
So she asked for help from the outside.
New startups in the human resources industry are constantly appearing on the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing the software with the specific purpose of measuring the staff responsibilities, it allows startups to make companies a quick vote, target specific teams and demographic groups, further offer complete employee anonymity and a hotline for complaint, and in some cases also allow informants to bypass their superiors and contact directors directly.
"There are tools like Strava and Fitbit on the market that track your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the Reedwood City-based startup at Glint.
Errett said that Glinta gained more awareness of what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years.
In addition to quick surveys and the voting of specific teams, Glint offers a company's temperature map and a cursory overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of low-level managers - allowing the user to work on the correction.
Companies are beginning to realize the need to take care of the culture of the working environment - in case they become the next Uber - which is in the back of scandals after a former employee posted a post on his blog describing the company's environment and harassment of employees who dare to speak outblaimed.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the website Let's Talk Payments, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and comps sector can exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Startup Convercent from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the start of the year, just before Uber scandals.
Nearly 600 Convercent's clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
He also took Uber under his wing recently.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable "lightning" surveys, collect confidential information in real time and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, the complaints are sent directly to the Board of Directors.
"The court of public opinion has authorized regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, Convercent's founder and executive director.
If a company is convicted of malpractice of its employees or unethical behaviour - and if it does not take legal action - it may face costly consequences as a result of customer boycott, staff exhaustion or legal proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using the Convercent for more than a year to raise employees' awareness of corporate principles and procedures, and to ensure an easy way to contact corporate management.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to trace a phone number or e-mail to the company's management, officially file a complaint and hope for a successful resolution.
It was often a deterrent and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, the general's attorney for Ruby Tuesday, according to which there was no reliable way of monitoring staff complaints.
Now, with the company's use of Convercent, it is ensured to quickly detect and solve problems that have never previously reached the managers sitting in the offices, miles away from the actual handling of complaints - for example, discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"It's coming to a holistic, overall view of the experience of employees," said Vitrano, who runs the Ruby Tuesday group overseeing risk management.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from litigation by employees."
The companies stopped taking on the ethics, values and participation of employees in a light weight in 2002 after the accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, collapsed after Enron's collapse in the abuse of employee ethics rights, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until the social media "shaped the whole thing up" that companies began to realize that they simply couldn't hide their skeletons in the locker in the online world.
"Before people started using technology to track the ethics of technology, they were relying on the faith," Quinlan added.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which the company pays regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity that is being approved by the courageous capital investors who have supported both startups.
As part of its February campaign, Convercent raised $10 million in total from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and eventually took in $47 million in capital.
Glint raised $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and raised $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and risk capital.
The growing number of research clearly confirms that today's employees expect more from their workplace than ever.
And in competing markets such as it is. Silicon Valley, the main advantage is not high salaries and interesting projects.
Employees want to see that they are being accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to a society that seeks a positive mission.
"If people are happy in their work, perceive that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of society," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make money if companies thrive and companies thrive, if their employees are happy.
And when an analytical tool emerges on the market to ensure the engagement and commitment of employees to the company, it is no wonder that there will be plenty of investors to support this effort.
According to work culture experts, it is important to have data on staff satisfaction.
But the data itself is pointless if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The fact is that once a company requests feedback from its employees, there may be major changes.
And unless the change comes up quickly - at worst at all - it can create disappointment and disinterest from the staff.
"Once you ask for 4,000 views, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, the consultancy director at Kotter International, which has witnessed many companies that relied too heavily on the data itself.
"Because as soon as you don't get things done, the staff will ask the question, 'They've even heard me?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, then why would I care?""
Madison Reed, which now regularly conducts a survey of employees every month, is able to solve the problem by one day thanks to Glint, Errettová said.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated with slow decision-making and the quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganise several teams within the company and start training for communication to a successful solution to the problem.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining a very important view of its employees and hopes to achieve high employment in the industry, which is known for frequent redundancies in the long term.
"If you are not seeking to create a transparent working environment, the staff will not believe you," Vitrano added.
"And once you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company goes bust."
Thursday became the warmest day.
Thursday is the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic with 38.3 degrees recorded in Strážnice na Hodonínsko.
It surpassed Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
This was reported by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Compared to Tuesday on Thursday, however, there were not many temperature records.
The heat hit mainly Moravia, in Bohemia it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were broken or set to 35 from the 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term long-term measuring stations recorded a record.
For example, in Strážnice today's temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice, Břeclav today's 37.4 degrees surpassed the original maximum by four tenths of a degree and in Pohořelice on Brno the current 37.1 degree exceeded the record by three-tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
High temperatures appeared today mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice, the heat was in Dyjákovice in Znojmo and Brod nad Dyjí on Břeclavsk, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
By contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, today's highest temperatures so far were only around 22 degrees Celsius today.
"The heaters started to grow there only later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside, according to the ČHMÚ, and on Sunday there could be significant rains.
In most places of Moravia, however, the high temperatures will remain on Friday and in southeast Moravia on Saturday.
We've had this misplaze.
Billionaires are not satisfied with that same vote in the election as every single person of the adult in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not all of them are as rude as Andrej Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
Penta owner Marek Dospiva, along with other fellow under-water fellows Martin Burda and Antonín Frych, is sponsoring Robejšk's Realists.

Convicted corruptor and king of Czech gambling Ivo Valenta acquired the Private Members' Party.
The political movement Agrofert, as the project of Andrej Babiš was inadvertently named by the mayor of Kroměříž, Jaroslav Němec, is a chapter in itself.
Their billionaire was also recently captured by the Mayors.
It is Dalibor Dědek, owner of the company for the Jablotron security equipment.
In his own words, he enters politics to do good.
Entrée in the mayor's jersey, however, did not go very well for the Decek.
"I've never dreamed of small goals," he said at a press conference.
This means that my aim is for the Yes movement to get the Mayors' Movement to get 20 percent in the elections.
Some smiled a little.
But the old man's slip-up is rather significant.
Billionaire Dalibor the Old Man is a man of firm views.
Although he intends to compete for the votes of the Mayors in the jersey of the Mayors, he continues to support Andrej Babiš.
The old man supported Babiš in the last parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a seasoned orator and does not rule the pleasing rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote of him before the 2013 election.
But he certainly does not go into politics because he would like to personally improve.
For me, Babiš will remain a hero.
He's willing to step out of his world, which is in control, and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors presented him as a new addition, he confessed his admiration for Babiš again.
And he said he wanted the Mayors to learn to imagine the possible collaboration with Babiš.
Some may appreciate that the Old Man does not change his views and stands by his or her own, no matter what jersey he is wearing.
Others may speculate whether Babiš is sending his B to the Mayors to build his B-men to someone this clumsy.
Others may ask whether the head of Jablotron, for example, has disjointed with the head of Agrofert in a bad way in the store and is not looking for another way to defend himself against his business rival.
The first of Dědek's public appearances, however, was not only revolving around Babiš.
The grandfather promised to send ten million crowns to the Mayor's campaign.
And if he needed more money, he said, he'd send more.
A few years ago, a similar statement would have been hard for anyone to pause.
Indeed, the judicially recognized crook Zdeněk Bakala was throwing millions in all parties before the 2010 election.
The political division of the security agency Vít Bárta, TOP 09 and the Civic Democrats together came to nearly thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving a political party more than three million.
When the Old Man enters politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
He might not have to ask himself then why politics has such a bad reputation with us.
His first days in politics were crowned by the Old Man by proposing a tax credit for families with studied children.
People with a college education come to about fifty thousand a month.
Those with the basic ones at less than twenty.
A man with 50 grand is rich by his standards.
The one with the poor.
In the Grandfather's vision of society, the poor pay their taxes honestly, and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of the welfare state, the course of which they are not very involved.
The rich simply need to be helped to avoid misery with want.
Mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition, and Babiš rub his hands.
The rest of us, thanks to the Degree, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
The question then remains as to who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not have members of their party or the citizens and citizens of the state for their employees and the country as their property.
Finally, those who want to have a good life in a rich country for all people, not just some.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to be reduced by 234 million.
Selling a property is sometimes not easy.
And often he won't be helped by 11 bedrooms, a gorgeous view of the sea, or the fact that the property is being sold by US President Donald Trump.
When selling the Le Chateau des Palmiers's villa complex, the price went down by a whopping £8 million.
This was reported by the website Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says of the property: "Horam, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to the site like no other.
But even the real estate company's association with the US president did not defend the extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean mansion by an astonishing £8 million.
The original price of the property was £21.5 million, the final price dropped to £13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex therefore costs about 76 average flats in the centre of Prague.
And no wonder.
The breathtaking 5 acres of the Caribbean island of Saint Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property also includes a swimming pool and a tennis court.
The property is planted with dozens of palm trees.
The terrace offers a wonderful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price was reflected in the fact that the association with the president was not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the normal property prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
Speculation says he paid around £15 million.
The property was to be purchased for the purposes of the lease.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
With the new award, however, it ranks second.
The property in the neighbourhood was valued at £13.5m.
The NCAA decided to finish off two training sessions a day. For the Bruins, long days
The 11th morning is approaching, and U.S. football players at UCLA are crowding the sidelines of the new school playground.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal a sweaty back, an unmistakable emblem of the first day of the training camp.
For most of the team members of these few minutes of doing nothing, the leisure is supplanting the lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will retire to the rooms after a three-hour training session to study for the final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting to be held in the upcoming morning at 6:30 a.m.
"The next three days will be a big kick for these guys," said Bruins coach Jim Mora, a short while before Monday went off on Tuesday.
By eliminating two practice sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to relieve the players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exams are over.
That's why the first three UCLA trainings are scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to be moored to the already crowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in the six seasons Mora spent Coach in Westwood, the Bruins' training camp starts a week earlier than last year, and the practice sessions are limited for the summer semester. The decision to limit the number of training sessions from two to one a day also has an impact on this.
A total of eighteen practice sessions are scheduled by August 20, with formal preparations for the first game against the Texas A&M team, which takes place in September.
Mora has been quoted as saying he supported the NCAA's decision, even though it added another item to the players' already charged diary.
"Three or four days, the players are under a lot of stress and it's very exhausting for them," Mora said.
"But no one has given up, everyone is trying. They're great.
I think on Saturdays, when we have more time, things will calm down."
The UCLA will be closed after the training camp is over, which will not be easy to view the clear lines of the surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and the luxurious Luskin Center, which was occupied by the players after the protection net was harvested behind the goal pole.
The Bruins players should take the hotel from this week, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms are emptied during the season, there could be a problem.
"The Seat will be guarded by the security service," Mora added.
"Safe is taken care of, but it's possible that someone can rent a room and record our training sessions.
Such material is well traded.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security, as will the No. 8.
We will use our resources to the maximum.
I believe everything will turn out well.
It's all planned."
Facebook plans to scrutinize facts to limit the number of fake news
Facebook will be sending more potentially fake articles to check third parties and view findings under the original posts in an effort to combat the so-called "fake news," the largest social network said on Thursday.
The company writes in a statement on its website that it will start using up-to-date machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which it will send to third parties for verification and potentially display the survey results below the original contributions.
Facebook has been described as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced the presidency's election for last year.
There are political debates about the matter in Europe. French voters are inundated with an avalanche of false news about the presidential election in May, and Germany plans to impose a fine on the social media network ahead of the September elections in advance if it does not promptly remove angry contributions.
Facebook said in a statement issued in Germany on Thursday that it was preparing to launch a new feature of the check on the review in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to showing messages authenticated by third-party, people are asking for more content to be better informed and to make the right choice to decide what they can share," Sara Su, a product news executive at Facebook, said on her blog.
It added that Facebook was continuing to test the "related articles" feature and is also working on further changes to reduce the number of fake news.
Creating a Graphic Novel: a Story about A Castle in England
The small castle of Scotney Castle recently starred in Squeeze's music video, and Margaret Thatcher also found her refuge in it during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has witnessed 700 years of stormy history from his cozy Bewl site in Kent, Britain, to create a graphic novelty, inspired by the curly-grass Jamie Rhodes of York County - known for his penchant for historical documentaries.
"A look at the writing of a man who is 300 years after death fascinates me," says Rhodes, with a straight face.
"When I hold the letter in my hands, I feel a personal connection."
The graphics amendment A Castle in England documents the lives of families who dwelt at Scotney Castle from the Middle Ages to the Eduardoan period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, this is not the first book of Rhodes inspired by the archives: he is also the author of the Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of inspired documentaries by the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by a thumbprint on a letter written by a double agent in the '70s who worked for the Yakobs,' he said.
"That's his thumb print!
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those times you had to light a candle to read.
When I sniff the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I love the archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated by the old papers, support from the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and the possibility of staying almost four months in the castle is almost like a dream. [to tell you the truth, I've extended my stay a bit.")
Rhodes spent his time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browsing the archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of the hyenas on the wall and the bottles that had been dumped for centuries in the ditch.
He walked around the property and explored the ruins of the old castle, talking to gamekeepers, gardeners, and occasionally with the artists who worked on the illustrious for his book.
At night, he "drinked on whiskey and wrote."
Scotney's confidential history is relatively largely unknown, as the National Trust did not gain access to the documents until 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at the post ten years later, the staff were only beginning to penetrate the archives Rhodes described in words as when "the Arabists of many centuries throw up their hands with their hands, saying, 'Put it in the attic'."
The diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire, the maps depicting the property: "You may think the land dispute is boring," Rhodes said, "but I've come across a case where two families tusfight over the razor.
Stop it, people!”
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a stepping stone and plunges deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows the man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English uprising of 1381.
"I found a record of the 1380 castle rebellion, which was called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex in the book," Rhodes said.
"The English uprising actually started in this area, and it occurred to me that rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe they're connected after all."
Other stories are firmly linked to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priesthstrated by Darrell's family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was not discovered until a few years after the coffin was uncovered).
Rhodes's favorite family is Darrell's: "I was intrigued by the men's race - the men of the time were always in debt and spent money on things they couldn't afford.
Different generations of the Darrell family handled it by marrying the rich or old missus - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to be headheaded by his heirs.'
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes searches for more adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week gig in the Finnish wilderness, where he was taking inspiration for his next book on the Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that was swallowed up by nature.
But it is a special place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I thought, 'Now to get the hell back to real life.'"
Washington changes green card award conditions
The media published President Donald Trump's words about a new US immigration plan that will also make a change in green carding.
This is expected that the number of legal immigrants will fall by 50,000 year-on-year as a result of stricter rules on the granting of temporary work visas and the reduction of family visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and the president.
The bill will soon be submitted to Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers. We will achieve this by changing the rules for issuing green cards to the residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will prioritize English-speaking applicants who are funded and will demonstrate capabilities that will benefit our country," Trump, a quoted media, said.
Sexual robots are on the rise - we should be on the lookout
Just when it looked like 2017 couldn't be more bizarre, a report of the technological development of sexual robots appeared online.
Yes.
Sex robots are really popular at the moment.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sexual robots within the next five to ten years.
In the words of a former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and the co-founder of the FRR Noel Sharkey, the rise of sex robots must be seen seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the nipple shape and the look of the robot's nails.
"People are teasing them, but sales are growing and we must be prepared to see them more and more often," said Sharkey on the occasion of the release of the report.
Modern sex aids are transformed from inflatable Mr. to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course, the artificial intelligence mimics of a person's behavior.
The user can "adjust" the robot in their own image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
Very disturbing, however, is the fact that many robots have their own "personality" that would also shame the Stepford missus.
Modern inflatable dolls have evolved into a robot woman with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set up different character traits to his surrogate woman, among them the shyness.
And then there is True Companion's sexual robotic wife Roxxxy Gold, which is supplied with pre-programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah," which is characterized by the shy nature and "wild Wendy" with a "adventive" nature.
"The Personality of Roxxxxy Gold is set up to suit your personality as much as possible," reads the True Companion website.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like the people.
She may be tired, talkative or be "in the mood."
The rise of sex robots is alarming for several reasons - which do not include confusion for actual interpersonal relationships. What is worrying are the inferior female character traits and forcible innuendo - e.g. frigid (read defiant) Farrah.
True Companion on its websites, the True Companion likens the Roxxxxy to the vibrator for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have a Roxxxxy?" the page reads.
But sex robots are not just a fetish or a sex device.
Their emergence and near-perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - a departure from ideal or sexual equality towards a desire for captivating sex with an optional premium.
Most men, of course, don't buy a robotic woman, and while the FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the fringes of interest from the general public.
However, this marginal interest may become a mirror set by the current modern age.
And most people aren't weird or violent until they get a free market excuse.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women all over the world are earning their rights and the White House is sitting in a president who is often very derogatory to the woman's address.
The most horrific aspect of the series The Story of the Handmaid is not what we see - the bodies hanged and the hollowed-out eyes, but rather the realities of these visions.
The book's book The Handmaid's Tale is a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems to be a small step.
Sex robots should, as far as possible, resemble real women (albeit with the standards of a porn actress).
Their creators construct them to be pleasant to the touch and act at first glance as a real woman.
But when it comes to their "personality," the robot cannot replace the real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just walk away.
They have no job or history. Nothing that would inspire their independence or undermine their devotion to its master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
Speaking of the 21st century: maids.
NBA star on the green arm.
Curry is fighting for a cut in California.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry, despite a botched first shot, was not lost in his first start to professional golfers.
The two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Award winner played in the Ellie Mae Classic of the lower Web.com Tour in the tournament in the California Hayward Tour in the California-based 74 round and will fight for the cut.
The Golden State quarterback, who won the second NBA All-Streets with the Warriors this season, started off nervously, and his first tee shot ended up in a beverage bracket parked by the Fairway.
Even then, he was not as accurate between the holes as he was under the basketball basket, yet he left a dozen professionals behind him with a four-shot over par record.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, to have to call the referee right after the first hit, but then it fits a bit," Curry said, noting that he was hit with a huge stage fright.
It was very nervous to hit the first shot of the tournament, but it was all I'd hoped for.
"If you'd told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd take it immediately," he added.
If Curry manages to fight his way through the cut, which is likely to be set for two shots under par, he will become the first representative of another sport to do it on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time and now that I've got rid of my stage fright, hopefully I can do it," said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played in celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
He is starting for the first time in the tournament in the PGA.
He received a sponsorship exemption to participate in the Ellie Mae Classic and retained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour is one of the categories under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big victory?
Against this, Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense
The unmistakable sign of the Trump era is the political divisions that divide American voters and, on a micro-alspan, break entire families.
Over the Christmas and Thanksgiving period, the American newspapers were swarming with advice on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
We're supposed to be just waiting for the nerves to get our nerves.
But less attention is paid to Trump's ability to rally the family.
I'm talking about it because my cousin came to visit me in New York this week - a poet and a fan of the left who lives in Chicago and who has been paying for a Republican fool in our family for a long time.
She reminded me that the togetherness in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump at the White House, the whole family - including all the Republican siblings she's balked at politics for years - is on the same page.
It's a good thing at a family table dinner; but it strikes me that it poses a significant risk in a broader context.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
If we're talking about "normalization" and Trump, we're referring to the frightening possibility that his anthoon can one day lose their appeal.
But there is an even more horrific long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who, defying his standards, will suddenly emboddle in what might be rational.
In these today, with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of the crazy dealings - the dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax return) - both of which look like very mild offenses compared to Trump.
With Trump's departure, it is enough for the subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be an immense improvement.
We took advantage of my cousin's visits and took the children to Central Park for the biggest carousel run by the New York Parks Department - you won't find a better use for your $3, unless you need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the centre roller is covered with fiberglass - clowns and the animals are filmed and look in horror at their own shoulders - a completely grim view and tinkling music, surprisingly, reminiscent of public transport.
Many clichés get tired soon: the view from the high-rise buildings, the panorama is ogled, instead of breathing on you through the atmosphere, and the reality of the city does not get your ideas.
Thirty-five years later, I still didn't get over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not really Swiss cheese - not counting the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage theme pub - but a London Underground Station.
Nevertheless, the carousel in Central Park provokes a remarkably magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds are having a great time, as do two mature women.
If I could rate the carousel, he deserved the maximum of points. But fortunately, no one is asking.
This week, I had a similar experience in the store when I was asked to review my "experience" on a scale from one to five when I paid by credit card.
It's the same in the café on the corner of my street, except I can throw a 15% tip for something I buy behind the counter for the evaluation.
Not only does it slow down the otherwise fast sale, but the waitress is thus forced to rub in the favor of shoppers when it is not needed.
The woman at the store was a smile of apologetites to me when I reluctantly assessed my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has had to be taken to hospital.
Last year he was treated for cuts to the wrists, which he had self-inflicted after falling in a cell, according to the prison.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appealing the original murder sentence.
His girlfriend, Steenkamp, was killed in the early hours of the morning on Valentine's Day in a couple of rounds of gunning through the toilet cabinet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he had mistaken her for a thief.
Prosecutors announced their intention to re-example, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court and the trial would take place later this year.
If successful, Pistorius faces an extension of the sentence of up to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a baby was born in captive captive to a bred panda that had coil in the wilderness.
For the panda rescue program, it is a huge success.
The centre is trying to expand the gene pool of pandas chimed in captivity.
The center's worker, Zhang Zhong, told the New China News Agency that there was a high risk of breeding pandas stemming from inbreeding.
In fact, there were only 471 pandas in captivity at the end of last year.
In the wild, only two thousand survive.
The effort to compose captured pandas with the wild ones is thus the first step towards the breeding of pandas to help protect the species.
Cchao-cchao, 15, was released into the nature reserve at the start of the Panda's Mantua Mantua period on 11 March.
Thanks to the tracking device on their necks, scientists could observe her every move.
She met her chosen one, Cao-cchao, 12 days later.
The sexual intercourse with the male panda lasted a minute and a half and was successful.
This, too, can be considered a minor miracle, because the panda males are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males are quite miscalculated by the time when the female is ready, plus they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The cub was born healthy and, even as Chao-chao had an extra appetite during her pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after the birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
For illegal camping in Greece, two Bulgarians were detained
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the comments were quoted as bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, was detained by the Sithonian police in the early hours of August 1.
They were all released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said for bTV that the Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping and are imposing strict fines on anyone caught at a place where camping is not allowed.
Checks will be run all season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Spilková is in 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
Golfer Klára Spilková ranks in a share of 50th after the first round of the British Open major.
The playground at the Kingsbarns, Scotland, bypassed with a one-stroke score under par, having made three birdies and two bogeys.
The 22-year-old Czech player is thus hopeful of making the cut at the famous major for the first time.
Entry to the $3.25 million prize competition came out best for American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round in a 64-shot record, eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are pulling millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has already temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
The Dutch NVWA Food Safety Authority told Reuters that it was investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, which it said was that 80 percent of the eggs on the market were safe.
The Authority stressed that the risk was only a limited number of types of eggs recognised as specific figures.
According to the German authorities, the amount of the toxic substance in the eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but it is a potential threat to children.
Czech JRC spokesman Petr Majer said that eggs and chicken from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities also approached the closing of breeds, had not been imported to the Czech Republic recently.
However, veterinarians will take random samples of eggs and chicken from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, the markets of which have emerged as the insecticide problem marks.
Eggs from Belgium were last seen on the Czech market in April and eggs from the Netherlands as recently as in May, according to the veterinary administration.
Chicken from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is usually part of flea preparations, everything and ticks.
However, it must not be administered to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The WHO, the World Health Organization, considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
His high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss him, says goalkeeper Sedláček and is looking for an engagement.
I'd like to catch ten more years.
"Maybe I'll come back one day," said 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in the Zlín jersey.
It depends on whether he gets an engagement until the start of the new year.
What were the four years you had in Latvia?
If I had to rate it like I did at school, then three.
The first year I didn't catch much, I had an experienced goalkeeper in front of me.
I was learning.
The second year I started catching.
Before the third season, I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalkeeper, with whom I took a rotation again.
I assumed last year that I would catch all the time.
But we only got maybe five points during the opening ten games, so the coaches started shooting it.
At the end, my colleague was catching more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it for next season.
How was life in Riga?
Beautiful.
It's a small Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, we'll be getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How challenging is the KHL for the goaltender?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or the Slav, who have to change their playing style against them.
Skiliness is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing backwards, fighting more.
I didn't see the problem in the width of the pitch.
The difference is the Russians want to play to the empty.
They shoot a little, and even though they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There are more shots in the Czech Republic after all.
Didn't you have a problem with travelling and moving over seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can get some sleep.
The program is usually made so that you play, like, four matches out there and then you have two days off.
How do the Latvians feel about their club in the KHL?
As a national team.
The whole of Latvia watches hockey, along with basketball it is a national sport.
They all cheer.
Even when things weren't going well, a lot of people came.
Did Dinamo's KHL's tenure to help Latvia almost advance to the quarterfinals at this year's World Cup?
The KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the start.
And from the same time, their World Cup results began to go up.
At the 2014 Sochi Olympics, they fell to Canada in the quarterfinals just 1:2.
That was an unreal result for them.
The KHL brought them to a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts came through in Zlín and is Ralfs Freibergs before signing the contract.
Why does it come in so many?
They're not B players, they're really quality.
The local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, the Latvians are among them.
It's a natural direction.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still without an engagement?
I knew at the beginning of February that I would not continue in Riga.
That's how we started looking for something.
On the table was Sparta.
But because they didn't have the budget for the goalkeeper, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was a classic.
We talked to different teams, but they decided on someone else in the final.
So I'm training at home in Zlín and I'll be waiting for something to come up.
Aren't you nervous about it?
That's what I was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand I am at home after a while.
I caught something in the KHL, so I'm taking it the other way.
The question is when and where I'll sign.
How real is the option of getting the new year up in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month, where what's going to come out.
Now all I can do is wait to see what the agent says.
Do you prefer a competition?
The past season was not enough to be able to choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government fling at Let continues.
In January this year, in an article with the care of a proper manager? I also wrote about the camp at Lety u Orlík.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I would like to recall the core passages of the article.
The camp at Lety has been talked about for many years.
For readers who don't know exactly what it's about, it's probably best to look at, for example, the official site of the cultural monument of the Lety's Palace.
There, in the introduction to the historical overview, they will learn that the camp was two kilometres east of the village of Lety, that from 8. 8. 1940 served as a labour camp, from 1. 1. 1942 was a collection camp and from 2. 8. 1942 became a Gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first Leisure Prisoners were assigned to the Auschwitz transport.
On 4. 5. 1943 370 people were transported by the largest transport to the extermination camp.
There were 420 in total.
A very sad history of the immense hardships of human beings, which were again caused by human beings and perverted ideology.
There is no dispute that it is necessary to constantly commemorate these events.
Nor is there any dispute that the commemoration should take place at the memorial in the place of the experience of these people's suffering.
The problem is elsewhere.
Under socialism, the camp was somehow forgotten a little, and in the 1970s a pig farm was built near and part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, and a memorial was unveiled at Lety in 1995.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy and demolish the pig farm, but it has not yet done so.
In 1998 the memorial was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration has been under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pig farm.
So much for very briefly the facts of the camp's post-war fate.
It was not until last autumn that the government approved the purchase of the pig farm and decided to have an expert report to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the pig farm.
According to the Minister of Culture Herman, "there are some numbers, but I think I would waste those intentions if I went to the public with them."
Let's see what the expert opinion brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, it could be hundreds of millions, while others say the price can reach the billion.
Either way, it's by no means a cheap proposition.
And yet, just a few hundred metres from the former camp, a memorial is worth nearly ten million crowns, in whose modifications the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the full transaction were funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is probably not the case, I think it would be a waste of money anyway.
Doesn't the government have other priorities?
The monument, a dignified reverent place, stands with the will of history in the virtually immediate vicinity of the tragedy passed, and anyone who wants to be can bow to the memory of the suffering and the murdered.
I see no reason to change this!
Let's leave it to the way it is, and keep the reverent place with the utmost care.
The entrusted property, including the taxpayer's money, should be handled by the responsible person, in this case the government of the Czech Republic, with the care of a proper treasurer.
At least with the one, like in your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister is not the whole government.
Even so, from the point of view of the above, I see the slogan of the leader of the ANO movement only as an empty pre-election proclamation.
In May this year, I went to see the place directly.
Very decent driveway, landscaped parking, replicas of wooden camp barracks.
In one exhibition, in the other an integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheater with seating and a view of its own reverent site, which is made of stones located on a gentle slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place as appropriate.
Archaeological research is currently underway at the site of the original camp.
It would be prudent to consider whether it would be possible, for example. a section of the uncovered foundations to be preserved and at least visually accessible in an appropriate way.
This is the direction forward by the Minister of Culture, Culture Minister Daniel Herman.
In the event that he succeeds in the government to get the purchase of a pig farm with state money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already problematic tenure as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
But a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory shoe diseases.
The non-healthy disease, which affects up to 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 patients in the UK, causes abdominal pain and blood diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to use meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms. However, University of Washington researchers have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that promote bowel resistance.
Study leader dr. Marco Colonna explained that the immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the breakdown of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
Once the scales bowl tilve to the side of the inflammation, an inflammatory bowl of the bowels of the intestines can occur.
As part of the research, researchers found the presence of immune cells supporting the body's tolerance in the stomach of mice with a particular bacterium.
This bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan to create cells - one of the building blocks of the proteins.
In addition, Professor Colonna said, "We have found a link between a type of bacterium - the Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of the bowel microbiome and the development of cells that promote tolerance of the body.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had."
At the same time, he suggested that if the same thing turned out to be true for humans, then a combination of L. reuteri and tryptophan-rich bacteria would help develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory bowel environments.
Postgraduate researcher dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, in the study of a certain type of immune cell that promotes the tolerance of the body, discovered that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mouse-bred-bearded cells lacked.
It drew from the fact that one group of mice has a different gut microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally dwell in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice was tested by the DNA-gear and researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells, which were lacking in the second group of mice.
MPPs that were bred in a sterile environment and lacked the gut microbiome - so they did not develop this type of immune cells - was administered by the bacteri L. reuteri - and created immune cells.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L reuteri in the liquid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without bacteria - to the undeveloped immune cells that were stored in isolation.
The immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After the removal of the active ingredient from the liquid, it was revealed to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-octic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent. At the same time, after the split in the doses of tryptophan, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us store L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known if tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri bacteria cause cell development in humans in the same way as mice, but genes defects associated with tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: "Each of us should probably strive to develop these cells, because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can increase the cell population."
Jose Mourinho considers signing a contract with Nemanj Matić and his transfer to Manchester United as 'genius''
Manchester United have recruited a "genius" to their team in the form of Nemanja Maticch - or so Jose Mourinho thinks after the midfielder made his debut in Wednesday's game against Sampdoria.
Matic, who signed a £40m contract, made his first match in a 2-1 win at Dublin - the last preseason match for the UEFA Super Cup, where United will meet Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed with the midfielder alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereiro.
However, as he did not take part in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Matic did not have form and played only 45 minutes, which Mourinho said was needed to work on before the start of the next Premier League season.
'He needs time, but he's experienced, intelligent, and he's got a brilliant mind-thinking football,' Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get fit as soon as possible."
Like Matic, his new teammates, Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku, also played their first game at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to form his 11th for the next season.
An independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign with three other players, but insists that the club has done a "fantastic job" and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"I thank the club for helping me recruit three of the four players," he added.
"Four of four would please me more, but I'll admit they've done their best for me."
Life's challenge to the king of chicken cutlets, Ládi Hruška.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The multifarious picture began to take shape thanks to a new show on TV Prima's Zdenek's academy.
Pear immediately snarled the chance.
"Dear Zdenek, I would like to join your cooking academy by doing this, because I think I can learn a lot from you," he said in a social media video.
And since the two of them have been tiptoeing for several years, Lada has not forgotten to irritate him this time either.
"In return, I can teach you Znojmo from Diet Chicken Chicken, American Cucumber or invite you out for water and show you why the fried cheese is popular," Hruška said.
He is really serious about his participation in the Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to move up a level and learn from the master.
'The question is the boss,' he told Lightning.
But Pohlreich didn't comment because he was filming new episodes of his next show, Chef!.
Only Prima responded to Hruška's participation in the culinary academy, saying he took the whole affair as his personal activity, which goes off-TV.
The big blow was dealt a blow by Hruška to Pohlreich in December 2004 with his first cook.
Within a few days, it sold over 300,000 units!
The new show, presented by Prima at a press conference for the autumn broadcasting scheme yesterday, is a genuine cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his pupils from the audience and introduces them to twelve cooking techniques in twelve episodes.
In the latest episode of his show Now, the boss cooks in November 2014 Zdeněk had his T-shirt ironed on the back of his T-shirt.
If he had my face there, I'd be laughing a lot.
"I just smile at the pear over the pear - the pear is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," Lada responded.
Lada's culinary art, he thinks his way.
"Guoting, according to Ládi Hruška, is not an option even at home, because I don't let go of my gastropunk home," the boss is clear.
I respect Zdeněk Pohlreich very much, even making chicken on honey according to him.
But his recipes will not appear on my show," Hruška said.
He's an asshole!
He's no cook for me, he's a TV clown.
"A gastronomical illiterate illiterate or asshole," Pohlreich said of Pear at a lecture.
"I'm not 20 to be able to wave my hand at them, but I don't deal with them that much," he said in the account of the insults to Hruška.
British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock a car and a house with a wave
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip injected into his body. With a simple wave of his hand, he can unlock the door to the house and the office and even start the car.
Steven Northam, 33, had a tiny chip implanted between his inch and forefinger and is currently offering the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology.
The implantation procedure and follow the therapeutic procedures are supervised by dr. Geoff Watson, an aesthetist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted to dogs and cats, and the entire procedure takes 30 seconds.
The Northam company also offers a microchip-compatible locks exchange service. The price of one chateau is 300.
The married one-child father had the technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which he starts with a simple wave of his hand.
White House prop worth thousands of dollars to the taxpayer
The White House's decision to fly the Navy helicopter to South Lawn to mark last month's celebration of the U.S. manufacturing industry, according to Navy records published by TIME, cost $24,000.
The green white helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the highlight of the program of 17. July at the White House, which was a parade of U.S. design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials surveyed a product parade from all 50 states.
The helicopter from the Connecticut was on display next to a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin fire truck and a forked lifting cart from the Mississippi.
The White House military officer issued the fragmentary order, or FRAGO, and requested the presence of the helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landing on South Lawn as part of an "extraordinary" event, Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - the units responsible for managing the helicopter, said.
"I wanted to make sure you had a known interest in such a major event," the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his superior, the assistant Navy Air Force Commander the day before the event began.
The report suggested the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn 17. July at approximately 7:00 a.m. to mark the parade, which is scheduled to start at 15:00 and will remain in place until the full evacuation of the entire site, which was scheduled to be between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m.
The email also said that if there was a delay in departing from the White House, a replacement crew would be sent for a return flight due to the working time regulations.
The original crew remained in place that evening with the helicopter, along with a unit of security personnel.
The records - obtained by TIME - it was not apparent if the second crew was eventually sent.
The Hatch Act prevents civil servants from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating a possible breach of this regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was in order," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you'd been blocked," the deputy commander wrote back.
This "Made in America" show was designated by the White House as an official event, and the Hatch Act would not have covered it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
In his attendance at the events, the president pushed for a medical reform that passed through the Senate and spoke of an effort to rein in the government's ordinance.
The use of air transport vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when travelling.
However, their presence purely for presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered the check in February after the presidential plane was in the background at his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is overwhelmed with complaints about the use of the presidential plane to his predecessor.
"The White House is pleased with the 'Made in America' parade, which has presented products from all 50 states made by Americans from American materials," said Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in the Washington and South Lawn areas, rehearsing possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with the utmost precision.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, the HMX-1 conducted a 58 practice landing at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America parade was part of the crew's current training session, the state official said.
The helicopter's unit on the same day flew in "non-presidential support missions" for the next eleven hours.
The White House said that no more props were paid for by taxpayers' money.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company had not been involved in the negotiations to issue the helicopter at South Lawn in any way.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights and the exact cost of the parade is difficult to determine, according to the navy.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for the fiscal year 2017, is the reimbursement of DoD's expenses for VH-3D at CZK 24,380 per flight hour.
The unit's records indicate a time of 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the helicopter's actual operating costs are well below that amount.
"Praining the taxpayer's costs based on estimates for reimbursement is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual cost."
According to a 2015 RAND study, reimbursements for expenses DoD do not include staff costs, but include the price of fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
The White House press secretary at the time, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the purpose of the parade.
"The Idea parade this week is to present products made in the US," Spicer said.
"I am aware that the Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our nation's defense, and that they provide the work of hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and other military facilities, the production of which is accounted for by countless American citizens.
This fact is to be recalled.’
It is unclear if Trump, while rounding his rounds at South Lawn, was also seen at the helicopter. The only certain he could say was that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House, Trump approached a Sikorsky company representative and joked with the media about his own product fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I own three of them."
The young woman was trapped in a swamp at Mácha Lake, and police waded to her.
The girl set off for the beach at about 2 a.m. on Sunday.
Instead of bathing, however, she was trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to use her mobile phone to ask the police officers for help, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"That's why the officers soon lost contact with her," police spokesperson Ivana Baláková said.
Several police patrols had rushed to the scene, which she had approximately described, but finding the young woman was not at all easy.
"Some of the cops had to wade through reed wetlands for hundreds of yards before they smelled solid ground again underfoot," Baláková said.
And so, she was missing.
The officers were oriented to the direction her cries of help.
"To avoid at least losing this connection, they agreed with it to count out loud," the spokesperson said.
Officers did not find the woman until a quarter to five in the swamps in the Borný locality.
She was on the brink of physical and mental strength and showed signs of hypothermia.
An ambulance called in her was taken to a Česká Lípa hospital.
The connection of the Old Man with STAN?
The in-demand bride becomes a saleable girl.
That's a bit of irony.
With his web project, the prosameslusny.cz as if the billionaire were essentially telling voters that STAN was suffering from a deficit in decent people.
He also affirmed that a politically disparate bunch of less-known mayors and independents, in fact, had no national agenda for the House election.
Her election candidate will simply become a decent person after his interview with the Old Man, whatever his political opinion.
Once, Vít Bárta started out this way, and it didn't work out very well.
In addition, with his hunt for decent people and personalities, who will eventually be replaced by some mayors on the ballot, which was also admitted by Gazdík, and the popular argument of the head of STAN is also about the movement's most important value of the movement being politically vetted and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians and the polls.
They will now be calmly replaced by hastily collected unknown personalities.
The total breakup with the grassroots, after which STAN changed the logo and the slogan, was also explained by Gazdík by saying that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the grassroots' candidates.
But if STAN was suspected of identity by few then, after the arrival of the Grandfather, a mere game of identity ends.
Not only has been defined for a long time against ANO by Andrej Babiš, but at the first joint press conference, Dědek, who publicly praises Babiš, said: "My aim is for the ANO movement, that is to say the Mayors movement, in the upcoming elections to get twenty percent."
Let's hope he's not mistaken for the movement.
Grandpa is a successful entrepreneur, and a billionaire is certainly no accident.
He often talks about politics much like Babiš, but unlike him, he does not build his own political brand.
For some time, STAN has been more like a reality show than a real political party, and Grandpa's helping hand seems to be making the in-demand bride even more into a shop-to-end girl.
For a while STAN went with TOP 09, then with the Peoples and now for a change looking for decent people.
Let's hope someone gets in touch.
Police dogs trained in Most flights by helicopter
Dogs specialized in search of explosives and search dogs were rehearsed by helicopter crossing at the Most Lake.
Police dog must not be timid and be afraid of flying, said the head of the police cynologists of the Ústí Region, Petr Tomášek.
Training of a police dog takes about two years.
At Most, both the adult trained dogs and those who are undergoing training have been trained.
In addition to standard training, in which they were to detect live samples of explosives around the lake and look for a lost figurehead, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
So that immediately after touching down the helicopter, the dog can go to work so he doesn't have a problem with the helicopter's journey.
"The helicopter will be delivered, the dog goes and immediately searches," said Tommy.
The dog, which is restless or after the helicopter journey is unable to start working immediately, is excluded from the training.
"Most of the time, they are then kept by dog handlers in the garden, for example," Tommy said.
Police have 76 dogs with various specializations in the Ústí nad Labem Region.
German shepherds predominate, but there are also more Belgian shepherds.
The dog handler takes care of him from the puppy.
"He is raising it himself, preparing it for the service the dog will do for us," added Tommy.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations that may reveal any medical disabilities.
If the dog is healthy and unbreakable, he takes his first exams at the age of 20 months.
"He gets into sharp intervention around two and a half to three years," Tommy added.
The length of service in the police force depends on the health of the dog.
It is usually served within eight to ten years.
They then mostly live with their dog handlers.
Trailer for season 3 of Narcos: Pablo Escobar is out of the game and Cali Cartel becomes the centerpiece of the Netflix hit series
Despite the end of the second season of Narcos, when the killer of Pablo Escobar is exposed, Netflix's series is far from over.
Confirmation from the streaming service has already been the third and fourth seasons - the former has already received the first trailer and an outline of other negative characters.
In his third season, the DEA is centered on the world's richest drug cartel: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of the four influential godfathers, they operate "as a Fortune 500-ranked society," with the only difference being that they are stepping up violent acts and bribing more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the cartel leader, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays the brains of surgery, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the merger with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
Pedro Pascal returns in the new trailer as Javier Peña, the character recruiting the American and Colombian law enforcement enforcers in the fight against drugs.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
Narcos' third season will make his debut on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghanistan's democracy is relying on women in politics
Elections can only be credible if all members of society, including women, participate, the UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the UN Assistance Mission's senior official, said hundreds of women were taking part in local council elections, three women were running for vice-president, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters were women.
"The role of women cannot be ignored," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative and credible if women take part, as well as all the relevant processes involved in the election.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on 5 April.
The Taliban have made several threats against the electoral process, which puts international combat activity in the second gear.
In this year's elections, for the first time ever, one democratically elected government is handing over its power peacefully to the following government.
Haysom said that the strong role of women would strengthen the democracy of Afghanistan.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission said that out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, they were women.
The unique brewery is re-brewing beer.
A good beer for the re-crested brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners was brought back to life a few years ago by a brewery in Lobč u Mšeno.
The brewery, first mentioned in 1586, has a Renaissance core and was rebuilt into a steam-rorooper operation in the nineteenth century.
It was the following years of heyday, when the brewery was famous for its dark beers.
During World War II, production was halted and the brewery was nationalized in 1984.
Since then, the buildings have served the state estate.
The work of the destruction was completed by the brewery's owners after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and dismantled into building materials.
But in 2007, new hope dawned in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouz.
They began to repair the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the structure and every detail.
They have been carefully involved and are studying archive materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery takes the same form as it did in the nineteenth century, when its golden era kicked off.
Their work was awarded by the brewery's declaration as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture, and the building became part of the European Industrial Heritage Trails.
In 2015, they also festively renewed the tradition of brewing beer.
To taste a great lobech beer in the picturesque landscape of Kokořínsko, visit the tap in the brewery area.
In brewing beer, they use Kokořín water springing from a protected landscape area, malt from the lobbies and chilies of žate.
In the saloon you will taste the traditional light lager, as well as dark beers and specials.
And don't miss the brewery's tour, it takes place on Saturdays and Sundays at noon and 1:30.
Czechoslovak, the largest artillery fortress?
One of the largest fortresses of its type on a global scale?
Such a unique building was to be the fortress of Stachelberg between Trutnov and Žacléř, at the top of the terrain ridge above the village of Babí.
It was originally intended to consist of up to twelve bunkers connected to the vast underground.
Here it was to be headquarters, barracks, ammunition depots, materials, power station, engine room and hospital.
However, the construction was ended by the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, he managed to build a single massive reinforced-concrete bunker and underground spaces were broken.
Thanks to the enthusiasts of the Stachelberg Society, who began reconstructing the unique structure in the early nineties, you can also see it here.
The underground is now 75 percent accessible!
The area includes, in addition to the T-S 73 infantry cabin with an exhibition and underground, the armed object of the light fortification, as well as the two built-up infantry cabins, trenches and a nature trail of the fortified Trutnovsko.
Refreshments, a cosy gazebo and breathtaking views of the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building was made listing alongside such monuments as the Great Wall, Traian's Port near Rome or the Assyrian Palace in Ninive and Nimrud.
The Chotěšov monastery originally from the early thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of a massive four-winged convent building above the beautiful garden.
The list he has made to, but unfortunately it belongs to unique structures that are in danger of extinction.
But enthusiasts don't want to give up, and they organize a lot of events to support the monastery.
One of them is the next edition of the Easter for the Chotěšov Monastery this Saturday, August 5th, where it will perform, among other things. Vladimír Mišík, Ivan Hlas, you will see fencing performances and you will look at the places of beautiful large buildings that are usually inaccessible.
Mostly, though, you'll enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
Do you want to look the Neanderthals in the face?
The exhibition Welcome to the Neanderthals in the Anthropos Hall of the Moravian Museum of the Moravian Museum in Brno attracts an unusual excursion to the deepest prehistoric prehistoric time to the world of our predecessors.
You will find out how the Neanderthals were able to cope with all sorts of extreme climatic conditions in a perfect way, mainly with the alternation of ice ages and interglacials.
Despite their simple material culture, they were immensely successful predators of their time.
You will also learn what they looked like, what their anatomy, their technological skills and hunting skills were, but also their aesthetic sensibilities.
That you wouldn't have said it to the Neanderthals?
Let yourself be persuaded in Brno.
The fourteenth festival KELT & WORLD MUSIC takes place on Saturday the fifth at Veveří Castle.
In addition to great music, you will see the building of the Celtic village, try out the Celtic way of life, including crafts, games for children and adults, divination, magic or ritual painting on the body.
There will be no misses La Quadrilla with Irish and Scottish dances, drum jamming, a bagpipe game and an amazing fire surprise performed by Carpe Noctem.
What does Moravskoslezsko taste like?
The seventh edition of the well-known gastrofestival How to Shmakí Moravskoslezsko takes place on Saturday, August 5, 2017 in the area of the Karlova Studánka mountain spa.
The chef will cook with chef Miroslav Kalina, you will taste culinary specialties and regional foods, enjoy musical and dance performances, a rich programme for children such as creative workshops, theatre, a bouncy castle, a smoker's competition path and, of course, a number of competitions.
Get to know the plant with one click.
Students with herbarian creation as well as ordinary plant lovers will be helped by the new free application Pl@ntNet.
When they're interested in what plant they've just come across on a walk, this app will advise them.
All they'll have to do is photograph the plant, and the app will recognize what kind it is.
The new app, which is available for both iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the CEEV Ethics and Environmental Education Centre in Bratislava's Mountain Park as part of the Secret Life of the City project.
The project was also joined by pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools, who photographed and added plants from their surroundings with the app's teachers to the app database.
The newly created French app is free to download on the Secret Life of the City website.
The main goal of the French programmers was for as many people as possible to contribute to the app with their images, thereby increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"Already children who hold a tablet or mobile phone in their hand can go to the forest," said this project's coordinator, Ivana Poláčková.
Based on a high-quality photo of the flower, leaf or the fruit of the plant, the application can recognize its name in seconds, which is then added to the photograph in both Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed us to translate the app into the Secret Life of the City project into Slovak and Czech.

GMB's concerns about investing in the McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The union is demanding assurances from the managers of the biscuit maker McVitie's about the long-running commitment to the factory in Glasgow.
The Scottish GMB union said the company was silent for the time being about any investment in the Tollcross factory.
The factory employs more than 500 employees who produce, among other products, the Hobnob and Rich Tea biscuits.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, said it had invested more than £5 million in the entire area in the previous few years.
It added that the employees and representatives of the unions would be "between the first informed" in the event of changes to the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the building company, the Scottish GMB unions expressed their fears that McVitie's would "not get its promises to finance and upgrade production lines."
GMB's main organiser Drew Duffy added: "The fact that we have not received a clear response from the site supervisor about the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Generations of many families worked here, and the employees come mostly from the local community and the Glasgow area, where working at the factory here is a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social separation.
From a job, pay, and utility - and, despite the outlook for Brexit, risingest cost of living and falling slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous manufacturer like McVitie's."
A spokesperson for Pladis said: "The manager of Tollcross received a letter from GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, as we value the continuing commitment to the employees and representatives of the unions.
A regular meeting with the staff and GMB representatives in Tollcross took place two months ago and there were openly discussed many of the problems at this meeting.
We were talking to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we assess our operations on a regular basis, which is true for all of our operations so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
To this she added: "In recent years, we have invested £5 million in the Tollcross area, particularly in production lines and streamlining of operations.
We are very much appreciative of the heritage of Tollcross and the site here, and in the event of any changes in the operation of the factory, the employees and representatives of the unions will be informed without delay."
Did PSG warn Barcelona of the move to Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain, in its attempt to win over Neymar, will not allow for its side after it has folded £189 million, the amount needed to redeem Neymar from his contract, but did this French team warn Barcelona for their record-breaking raid three years ago?
This sensational transfer has stirred up the waters of summer transfers. The Ligue Club 1 is ready to surpass more than twice the previous record amount for Paul Pogba's transfer to Manchester United, who paid £89m for him last year.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and, at the same time, the world's highest-paid professional athlete - after tax, he will receive over £500,000 a week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is outraged in the way Neymar drew his contract, despite the fact that a confidential source confirmed that the club has always tried to accommodate Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world alerted to this fact by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed their interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all the club that would be interested in taking over one of the best players in PSG.
"I'm not worried because as soon as someone tries to get one of our players, then we will certainly reach out to one of their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they are trying to recruit one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed the imaginary line when they expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti in the summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian national to leave under any circumstances. It is therefore possible that Barcelona is now swallowing a bitter pill for its bold negotiations with the departure of Neymar.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have broadly understood rules?
Donald Trump has given the nod to the anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And a day earlier, Trump wrote that China was not doing anything about the North Korean threat, and that this would not go on.
It also reeks of the idea of sanctions like straw from shoes.
You can't lump those things together.
Maduro's Venezuela really set off on the path to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is not just behaving as the US president would like.
Russia is a chapter in itself.
But if someone wanted to summarise all of this in such a way that even a common voter, an American, a European or another, understood what it was about, and what system of rules the policy of sanctions was based on, it would be an almost impossible task.
In the sanctions against Russia, President Trump merely pulls in what President Obama has already set, just giving it the execution stamp.
So why such a commute?
Last year, Europe was terrified that if Trump wins the US election, he hugs Putin and withdraw sanctions.
Terrible idea.
But in practice, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not relaxed, but they tighten.
But Europe is even more terrified.
German Minister Zypries says the Trump sanctions violate international law.
You mean that kosher is just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are no kosher or anti-Russian EU sanctions.
European Commission chief Juncker, for his part, complains that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
That's like sanctions are to be used just so weak that they don't endanger anyone?
The regular voter fumbles.
He has heard for three years that the fate of the anti-Russian sanctions depends only on the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
Now he learns that this is about the EU's energy security.
The voter is also fuming more broadly.
There are sanctions for Russia for being too assembled where it shouldn't be.
China is being scolded for mounting little.
Venezuela's president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country's borders.
All the punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see it as a system, an order or a rule?
Andrej Babiš: I am not considering cooperating with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš has married, crisscrosses the republic with his visionary book and is finalizing the election program.
In addition to the Pardubice Region, it has already completed all the candidates.
In his words, he did not intervene significantly.
He even agreed to have the Moravian-Silesian governor and shadow education minister, YES Ivo Vondrák.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be an MP or a governor," Babiš confirmed his earlier position.
You have been annoyed by a lot of incumbents and national politicians by their thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should run municipalities and towns on their own, with managers alone.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we elect the President directly, and I believe that we should also elect mayors and mayors.
In my book I don't mention the dismemberment of the incumbents, they might as well be there.
The question is how many there will be.
When presenting your book What I Dream About When I Accidentally Sleeping, I heard with my own ears that you were talking about the abolition of the councils.
I don't remember.
I was talking about a direct election and a reduction in the number of incumbents.
New York, with a population of nine million, has five districts and 51 incumbents.
Prague, with 1.2 million citizens, has 1171 incumbents.
And the mayor is blamed for building little and not preparing major projects, but she doesn't have the competence to do so.
The same is true of a government run by only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which is not to say they did it well.
But the current prime minister is not running a thing, he's just hosting the debate.
It can't work that way.
Is that why you want to push through the majority system?
It would be ideal, but it's hard to get through.
In the program, we only have a change to a one-round Senate election.
We have also proposed a moving mandate for ministers and an amendment to the House Rules to avoid unnecessary exhibitions by Members who are mainly to work in committees and committees, not to show off at the meetings of the House.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents fear.
That as a dictator, you will run the government, control the House with 101 members, abolish the counties and the Senate, and, through the grateful mayors, and take over the country as a whole.
It's definitely not like that.
There's nothing wrong with debating the number of Members.
French President Macron has announced a reduction of the legislature by a third, while there are 57,000 French to one legislator, while in our country it comes to 17,000 Czechs.
But no one accuses Macron of endangering democracy.
Even if someone wins the election by a majority in the Czech Republic, we have mechanisms to prevent them from making any dramatic changes.
But the consorts are great for those who have a parliamentary majority, just look to Poland or Hungary.
There is no such threat in the case of the Yes movement.
We just need a team that works for the people in the government, not for its parties or resorts.
For example, I do not understand why we have not been able to agree that only the salaries of teachers, staff in culture and social services will increase.
Why did they overrule me and add 21 percent to the GIBS members, who are already taking 60,000?
Would you step on that as Prime Minister?
The prime minister is to intervene when ministers behave uneconomically, mistake the government for a travel agency, and, with the state's money, they would like to do business as Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers are not supposed to argue in the government, the contradictions are to be said outside of it.
The cabinet must be put in the finished material, there is no place for coalition rifts, strengths and deals, that's where it's supposed to be decided.
How do you want to have a cohesive team when ministers are mainly party-based?
There is a constitutional law over the parties.
When it came to the crunch, Sobotka said the coalition agreement did not apply and set off Babiš from the government.
Any Prime Minister can do that.
But if he is a personality and has control skills, he does not need such idle gestures.
It measures everyone the same and requires a perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you would have proposed to be Chancellor of the Exchequer?
I don't think about it at all, we probably won't even be in that government, no one wants to work with us, although I don't know what terrible I did.
So much scepticism is misplaced.
The mayors have won the entrepreneur Dědek, who would like to cooperate with you, the wing of the tilted Jiří Čunk may win with the Peoples.
I don't think so.
The ČSSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not rule out a coalition with ANO, Václav Klaus Jr., who will also not oppose it, will become more likely to join the ODS.
I'd leave it to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-President of ANO Richard Brabec said you have many common points with Tomio Okamura's SPD, for example in the field of economics.
So the Okamuras come to be a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say it that way.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, ran as a puppet for VV, then he got money for his company from the Dawn, there was some coup.
He is, of course, a distinctive personality.
But a bit brownish.
If I take his program, he has a broad involvement of the people in the management of society, direct democracy, that's one can agree with.
I'm not asking you that at all.
I wonder if a man who has xenophobic views is acceptable to you, speak to you at the gallows demonstrations and wants to leave the EU?
We are not considering working with Mr Okamura's party, I cannot imagine.
It is clear that he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the tacit support of the communists to your minority government?
I can't even imagine that, but the voters will decide.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the second in the ranking, but God knows who will be the winner and who will be the two.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on the coalition government's agenda.
Let's go back to your efforts to run the state as a business.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything go, never decided.
Coalition affairs such as CEB or EGAP did not work.
I mean, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that was also the reason he fired me.
As soon as he did, CEZ took control of the Czech government.
After all, it is unbelievable that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by the management of ČEZ, which requires the Minister of Finance to vote at the general meeting of CEZ.
If you become prime minister, would you change your staffing position on the supervisory board and replace the top management of CEZ?
Jesus, if I'm Prime Minister, we'll see.
I'm not yet.
It is rumored that ČEZ has already sent out signals in your direction.
He would like to trade good cooperation with the ČSSD for an even better one with YES.
For example, after the election, everything will go on again.
I don't know anything about it.
I have no lobbyist Pokorný or Růžička, I am a separate unit and I do not deal with this at all.
Then respond directly.
If you head a government, will you seek to replace the management of ČEZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, the institutions you criticise?
I would like CEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he's done what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is look for Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although the state is to be in the ČEZ majority, he never drove it, it was only there in numbers, which is wrong.
For me, it's a trivial matter.
ČEZ is to take Dukovany, appraise them, put them in a subsidiary, arrange financing, do a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state is to fund and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And Czech Television?
Some of her shows are conducting a permanent purpose campaign against me, but I don't have and I don't have any competence to fire anyone.
But control it is.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay fees of around 7.2 billion a year for public radio and television, but they don't really know how these institutions run.
How come they don't?
After all, the House approves a report on their management, which has a direct influence on the positions of CEO of ČT and ČRo.
Look at the news being discussed, the super power pact of Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This is true both of the current parliamentary commission for leaks from the investigative files and at the lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he allowed himself to be pushed by Kalousek to get me out of the government, which passed the TOP 09 percentages, but the CSSD took them away.
They are afraid of breaking their corrupt system, so they are talking about the threat to democracy by Babiš.
No one is immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how ANO First Vice-President Jaroslav Faltýnek is building a position of power by installing his son on the supervisory board of Tepláren Brno and arranging the related lawyer, Květoslav Hlín, contracts with city and state firms such as the Prague Transport Company or Czech Railways?
We have a lasting dispute there.
I don't like it and I reproached him for a few times.
The Falloon argues that the lawyer in question works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As Treasury Secretary, I had no one.
We, unlike the socans, have never had a corruption scandal, no Pelta, Kratochovvílová, Březina.
If there was any sign of patronage in our country, we immediately fired such a man.
In this respect, I am uncompromising.
If something like this happened, get rid of anyone, it doesn't really matter who it is.
