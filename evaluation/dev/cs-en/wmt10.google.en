Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth US president in history.
Among other things, he will receive a diploma, a medal and a check for 1.4 million dollars for his exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The head of the White House will arrive in the Norwegian capital in the morning with his wife Michelle and will be busy.
First, he will visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with five members of the committee that selected him in October from among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple is then scheduled to meet with Norway&#39;s King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony at which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will receive it as the fourth US president, but only the third, to receive the award directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will speak about the Afghan war when accepting the award.
The president does not want to shy away from the topic, realizing that he is accepting the award as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
He increased the war effort a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, a fact that none of his critics will fail to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to give them to charity, but has not yet decided on a specific charity.
The packed program will then take the president and his wife to a banquet where, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, there will also be the prime minister and 250 other invited guests.
From the beginning, Obama was more reserved about the award.
For example, he stated that he felt that he did not fully deserve her.
He also repeated several times that this award is not just for him, but for everyone who strives for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said that it was a &quot;call to action&quot; for him.
Conservationist accused of extortion
The Litoměřice police accused the chairman of the civic association Společnost ochránců naturel Litoměřice of blackmail.
In several cases in the past year, he appealed to some construction procedures, for withdrawing the appeal he demanded money from investors for his own benefit, said Litoměřice police spokeswoman Alena Romová.
Lubomír Studnička is the chairman of the Litoměřice Society of Nature Protectors.
He is now in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
Brno&#39;s sorting containers don&#39;t smell much
In Prague, ordinary people can sort beverage packaging, while in South Moravian villages you will meet sorting containers at every turn.
And in Brno?
There to set aside a few minutes to find suitable bins.
I do not want to claim that waste is not sorted in Brno at all.
But it seems to me that, considering that we are the second largest city in the republic, the councilors are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the top league of waste sorting, not only because citizens here can still only throw paper, glass and plastic into the sorting containers, but above all because of the number of bins for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a PET bottle into the collection bin in the center?
It&#39;s a complete joke, mainly it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I&#39;ve come across so far is on Moravské náměstí opposite Potrefená Hus.
Don&#39;t let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but it seems like a hell of a lot to me.
Not to mention that even in other parts, waste sorting is no honey.
Many of my friends prefer not to sort their waste that way.
Out of laziness.
They are far from the dustbins.
I&#39;m not surprised at them.
I myself offered to throw away a few glass and plastic bottles after the party.
But I didn&#39;t see any colorful dustbins in sight on Kounicová Street.
Fortunately, I came across the right place on my way to the slush.
However, the waste was overflowing from it.
After all, it is still the center of Brno, which perhaps represents the city the most, right?!
But the Brno socialists are probably not very interested in ecology and some aesthetics.
They would rather buy the city a hockey extra league, which will embarrass us throughout the country, than buy a few extra containers and offer to sort other raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I&#39;m glad that I could confirm my assumption with official statistics after browsing the Internet for a while.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is in the worst situation in the entire South Moravian Region.
&quot;Paroubk&#39;s&quot; budget took money for pensions and sick pay
After the left added, despite the government&#39;s opinion, to farmers or civil servants, there may not be money in the budget for pensions, sick pay or building savings.
But also for interest from the national debt or for international lawsuits.
It will cause problems for those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists pushed for increases for some groups, they counted on the government to borrow additionally for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. &quot;It&#39;s just postponing problems to the future, laying mines,&quot; says Janota.
Increasingly higher interest is paid on borrowed money and it has to be returned at some point.
The state does not have much choice as to where to take it.
If they do not reduce social benefits or the costs of running the state, they must raise taxes.
To all whom the left has now added: firemen, teachers, farmers.
And later to their children.
People do not have to worry about pensions or sick leave, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, they will get them.
However, at the cost of the fact that the state will take on more debt - next year, not only 163 billion will be missing from the coffers, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow faster and faster and with it the interest costs.
The state will need money to cover it, and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity pay, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Due to the transfer of money in favor of several groups of voters, five billion will also be missing next year for the completion of highways and railways.
These are mainly sections that have already been tendered and are under construction, which cannot be redesigned and possibly made cheaper.
At most preserve, which is also not free.
It means the delay or stoppage of thirty large constructions, the withdrawal of European funds is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD suggested that it would solve the loss of money in a Solomonic way - it would reach into CEZ&#39;s dividends, which the state owns the majority of, and pour them into the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, and it is not a bottomless resource at all.
Last year, ČEZ received 18 billion in the budget.
Every year, the liquidation of ecological damages is paid from the dividends, they are used to supplement the pension account or serve as a reserve for the upcoming pension reform.
In addition, this trick increases the real budget deficit to the level of 5.7 percent of GDP according to EU rules.
However, the carnival of transfers does not end there.
Almost three billion was reduced in the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crimes, or for expenses for lawsuits, even for building savings.
It is not certain whether the state can do without this money.
It&#39;s a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we will have to pay anyway, states Janota.
The minister will then have to save money within the department or, in the worst case, resort to the government&#39;s budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing for the already launched two-billion-dollar project of the State Treasury, which is supposed to enable online monitoring of what individual authorities are spending on.
The first stage will start in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions would come, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
In the future, Americans expect a mobile phone on which the user will be able to switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans revealed sound promising.
Just press one key and you will be transferred from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
The American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers, is aiming for exactly this possibility.
We will enable you to maintain two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware indicated in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was shown for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Smartphone virtualization is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems to journalists.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, which simultaneously ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems side by side.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now VMware is working with European and American operators to test virtualization of smartphones, and the devices should reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Bare pistes are not the only concern of Krkonoše ski lifters.
The lack of snow also discourages people from booking ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, it is still possible to find free rooms in the Krkonoše Mountains for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year&#39;s Eve.
We have a lot of traffic on our website.
People go through the offers, find out the prices, but are still afraid to make a binding order.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if we think this Christmas will be in the snow or in the mud,&quot; said Martin Jandura, operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
Those who want a New Year&#39;s Eve stay in Špindlerův Mlýn exactly according to their imagination should not hesitate to order.
Those who prefer saving money and the quality of accommodation comes second, can still try to wait a few days.
Špindlerův hoteliers are currently only offering weekly stays on New Year&#39;s Eve.
I think they will try to give them for a while, but then they will also give in and go for a shorter period.
And then the available rooms will decrease quickly,&quot; estimated Jandura.
The Vrchlab travel agency Ingtours still offers free beds in all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in Christmas week, which is not sold out yet.
Even so, half of the places in our offer remain free.
That&#39;s why we&#39;ve already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute,&quot; said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlab travel agency can still offer New Year&#39;s Eve in the Giant Mountains, but there are fewer available places.
The first fortnight in February also sells well, the rest of the winter dates are sold on average.
This year, interest in winter stays is negatively affected by the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to see if he attacks.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are covered with snow during the week, Christmas will also be sold out,&quot; says Schiefert.
On the contrary, the rooms of the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou are being occupied a little better than last year.
We are about five percent better off.
We have the last few places for New Year&#39;s Eve and Christmas.
There is a lot of interest in Polish holidays in January, and February also sells well,&quot; informed Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pecs.
The Omnia hotel near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně is 80 percent full for New Year&#39;s Eve stays.
On the other hand, half of the beds in the newest hotel in Janskolazze remain free for Christmas.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by January, which at the moment is already about sixty percent occupied.
February is a bit weaker so far, but as soon as the snow falls, interest in stays in the Krkonoše Mountains will certainly increase, said the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
However, Krkonoše hoteliers still have to wait for a bigger amount of snow.
It should get colder on Thursday, if there is any precipitation, there should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, warming should come again, informed Jiří Jakubský from the Hradec Klinik workplace of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost comical with what schoolboy effort Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of being the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself considered the stupidest, on the Afghan question.
When he finally sweated out his long-awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he copied it over the copier from Bush&#39;s Iraq script three years earlier.
Not only does he use the phrase &quot;as in Iraq&quot; several times in the text itself, but he did not even hesitate to use the title of Bush&#39;s statement from January 2007 as the title of his own declaration: &quot;A New Way Forward&quot;.
At the same time, three years ago he himself criticized Bush&#39;s idea to send fresh military reinforcements to Iraq, plagued by civil war, as &quot;an irresponsible and, in its consequences, catastrophic decision.&quot;
However, the following months showed that Bush&#39;s strategy, based on the recommendations of field commanders, was the only one possible and so successful that Iraq is not even mentioned in the news today.
It did not improve Bush&#39;s reputation, but it objectively left his successor with a much more grateful starting situation than might have been expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama is hoping for a miracle to happen again.
Field commanders again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even harshly criticized the hesitant shooters in the White House, despite subordination customs.
He asked for 40 thousand men so that he could break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but couldn&#39;t think of anything better, so at least he cheated the general out of 10,000 soldiers.
He was able to squeeze the promise of another 5,000 from Europe, even though he originally expected at least 10.
The most problematic aspect of Obama&#39;s entire strategy seems to be his intention to begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in as little as 18 months and complete the process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than it answers.
Many doubt that the half-hearted increase will bear the same fruit as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well-ordered, its leaders honor agreements.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the opposite symptom - no one can be trusted and no agreements are kept.
Under these conditions, the Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing masters every day, are ill-prepared.
Political institutions, even if they are formally established, will remain only a Potemkin village, behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to flourish.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely difficult due to the opacity of the situation, which is further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even building an &quot;actionable state&quot;, which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation, does not seem very realistic.
The time horizon of Obama&#39;s strategy is striking in its voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the verge of exploding.
Only a truly romantic soul, untouched by reality, can believe that soldiers sent into the tumult of war in order to &quot;return home soon&quot; will cause the miracle performed here.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is sheer irresponsibility, as the Taliban will perceive it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is on the decline.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically affecting the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, the difficult question for the United States will be whether to try to solve the problem with military force.
It will be necessary to answer it just at the time when, according to Obama, America will begin a victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will also mean a dramatic turn in the Afghan situation.
The only band-aid for Barack Obama is the fact that the presidential election is three years away, leaving plenty of time to come up with another strategy if this one turns out to be a total flop.
Goldman Sachs executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior executives at Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
This was announced by the company, which is responding to sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 leading managers will receive shares instead of money, which can be sold in five years at the earliest.
In addition, shares can be taken away from managers if they take excessive risks.
According to the Reuters agency, Goldman Sachs is thus taking the lead in the effort to link rewards on Wall Street with long-term performance.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to take, said former JPMorgan investment banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank has become the target of criticism after it set aside nearly $17 billion (almost CZK 300 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
According to Reuters, the total amount of remuneration in the company for this year will probably exceed 20 billion dollars, despite the measure announced today.
High remuneration in the banking sector has become a hot political issue in many countries with the advent of the financial crisis.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intends to impose a one-time fifty percent tax on bankers&#39; bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds (roughly CZK 712,000).
France is also preparing similar steps.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in every field except physics
Today in Stockholm, a record five women received this year&#39;s Nobel Prizes in professional categories and for literature from Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf.
In addition to four scientists, among them was the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müllerová.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak, for research in the field of chromosomes.
Israel&#39;s Ada Jonath was awarded the prize for chemistry together with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for elucidating the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last laureate was the Nobel Prize for Economics, which was won by American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for analyzes of economic administration.
The only professional category that did not have a winner this year was physics.
This award was won today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each awardee received a diploma, a Nobel medal and a certificate of winning the financial award.
This amounts to ten million Swedish crowns (roughly CZK 25 million) for each category.
If there are more than one recipient in each of them, they share the reward among themselves.
US President Barack Obama received the traditionally most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo, Norway.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his award, because he is only at the beginning of his career and, moreover, he is at the head of a country that is fighting two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
But in defense of his policy, he added that wars are necessary in a certain situation to win peace, even if the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the Castle
On Friday morning, President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who is considering remaining in the government because he does not agree with the form of the state budget for next year as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and possibly Janot&#39;s stay in the cabinet will be the topics of their meeting on Friday.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, it has too high a deficit, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The president&#39;s spokesman Radim Ochvat informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to discuss her continued tenure with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget law, which Klaus will now get to sign, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
But on Wednesday, the House of Representatives agreed to the proposals of the left on the transfer of money and increased the money for the salaries of civil servants, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the proposals of the Social Democracy for covertly increasing the budget deficit.
Because of this, a sharp internal political dispute arose between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, which is why a question mark is beginning to float over the further operation of Fischer&#39;s official cabinet, whose formation was agreed upon in the spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, as adopted by the House, basically eliminates the package of austerity measures that the Fischer government pushed through in the fall, which it says is intended to stop the state from borrowing.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the law on the state budget, declared at today&#39;s discussion breakfast with businessmen that politicians have neglected a &quot;serious problem&quot; for a long time, which is the &quot;unsustainable deficit&quot; of public finances.
Today, according to him, he no longer has a good solution.
Improvement could only be brought about by a strong government, which could also rely on a broader consensus of political parties, the president believes.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is terrifying and the government should consider its continued existence.
The vice-chairman of the ODS, Petr Nečas, told ČTK that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer described similar words as &quot;strong statements&quot;.
Jiří Paroubek, head of the ČSSD, responded to Topolánek by saying that the budget deficit that Topolánek&#39;s former government prepared for this year, which will exceed 200 billion crowns, is terrifying.
Already on Wednesday, the ČSSD called the approval of the state budget for next year a success.
The people were also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman played Mandela in Clint Eastwood&#39;s new movie
South Africans say the new Hollywood film Invictus: The Undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, its struggles and victories despite some criticism that American actors are playing the lead roles.
The story tells about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the Republic of South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is represented in his life story by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said the 91-year-old Mandela asked him if he could play him in Eastwood&#39;s film.
Another important role in it is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, &#39;If I&#39;m going to play you, I&#39;m going to have to have access to you.
The 72-year-old actor, who won an award for his role in Eastwood&#39;s box-office drama Million Dollar Baby, has already played, for example, an abolitionist-turned-slave leader, a fictional US president and even a god in Evan the Divine, but rarely someone who is still alive and as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active work to end apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and then became the country&#39;s president for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is the Latin word for unconquered and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him
The film is the true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. President-elect Mandela knows that his nation remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders on a global scale.
The South African team would eventually advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela&#39;s story to the screen.
I had no other goal than to play this role as close to reality as possible, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be backstage before his speech.
Most importantly, he wanted to shake Mandela&#39;s hand.
I found that when I shake your hand, I take your energy, it transfers, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
In the film, Matt Damon portrays François Pienaar, the captain of the predominantly white national rugby team.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough world of rugby.
The big surprise for him in the end was when he met Pienaar for the first time at his house.
I remember ringing the doorbell, he opened the door, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: &#39;I look much bigger in the movie&#39;.
Despite the stark differences in the actors&#39; characters compared to their real-life counterparts, under director Eastwood&#39;s direction, Invictus: The Undefeated has received positive reviews and is rumored to be Oscar-winning.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment in the words: &quot;It was a very good story, a very well-made film.&quot;
In movie reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received a 76 percent positive rating.
The mystery of the glow over Norway solved: the Russians tested a missile
A strange light effect of unknown origin could be observed over Norway.
Only yesterday, the Russian Ministry of Defense admitted that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
But the launch was unsuccessful again, and the missile known as the &quot;Bulava&quot; type, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming a nightmare for Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence during rocket tests had no effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, Bulava didn&#39;t take off at all or was damaged in the air.
In Russian newspapers, &quot;Bulava&quot; is already being described as a &quot;rocket that doesn&#39;t fly&quot;.
A rocket that doesn&#39;t fly but lights up
This was already the 13th attempt in a row and initially proceeded normally.
Only at the end of the flight did technical damage to the apparatus occur again.
Apparently the engine in the third stage of the rocket exploded.
This time, &quot;Bulava&quot; was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows firing from a vessel that is in motion and submerged at the same time.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unspecified flying object, was indeed a malfunctioning &quot;Bulava&quot;.
After all, the Norwegians had no doubt from the first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generals are defending themselves this time and claim that it is impossible to speak clearly about failure.
The first two stages of the rocket survived and the accident only affected the third.
In previous cases, the engines broke down in the first stage.
Even though not a single test launch took place completely without error, only six out of thirteen are considered unsuccessful by the leadership of the Ministry of Defense.
The almost fifty percent success rate therefore fills the generals with optimism, and they still claim that the &quot;Bulava&quot; will one day fly without problems and that it can even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed a one-year contract at CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defenseman Vjačeslav Fetisov will appear again in a professional hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will help his team CSKA Moscow in need and will probably start already in Friday&#39;s KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov, who retired at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljaš got injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov trains regularly and agreed to help the team.
We just need to complete some formal requirements, the AP agency quoted the coach of the Moscow club Sergey Nemchynov.
It is not yet clear whether the famous hockey player&#39;s comeback will only cover one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of other players, said Nemčinov.
According to AP, if Fetisov returns to the ice, he will become the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, at the age of fifty-one, the legendary forward Gordie Howe played the entire season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the jersey of the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic golds, seven world championship titles, triumphed at the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he was also successful in the NHL, where he lifted the Stanley Cup twice in Detroit.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai complied with the union. Will cancel all overtime
The management of the Hyundai automobile company in Nošovice has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was precisely because of the frequently ordered overtime that the unions declared a strike alert on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesperson of the Hyundai car company, Petr Vaněk.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on one more Saturday shift this year.
We cannot give up on our production plan, it is essential, that is why voluntary overtime on Saturday, December 19, with two shifts, was proposed, said Vaněk.
The server Sedmička.cz wrote that the company of employees who work the Saturday shift offered a bonus of CZK 400.
People will receive it retroactively for working Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňek, the company has decided to change the method of motivating employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they will be reimbursed for overtime pay or they can choose an alternative day off on December 28 and thus extend their Christmas holidays by a day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees will receive paid fare and lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and burning point in terms of comments and complaints from trade unionists and protesting employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon to cancel all overtime for the month of December with immediate effect, Vaněk said.
Until last week, the car company&#39;s employees were forced to work two hours of overtime almost every day after an eight-hour shift.
After signing the agreement, the unions will call off the strike alert
The next meeting between the management of the car company and the trade unions is to take place on Friday morning.
Union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike alert.
The situation at the car company escalated last week on Wednesday, when around 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to constant overtime.
They also protested poor pay conditions and alleged bullying.
Management countered that overtime workers had to work to meet car delivery requirements.
In their announcement of a strike alert on Monday, the trade unions also demanded that no sanctions be imposed on the workers who stopped production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, the unions demand that the company reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay a reward of 5,000 crowns for her this year.
The Nošovice Hyundai car company now employs 2,000 people.
The company started serial production last November.
By September of this year, it produced approximately 80,000 cars, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also affects &#39;hardened&#39; HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow down the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that have already acquired immunity against drugs.
In some cases, this fact outweighs the fact that the compound does not act as strongly on the common variant of the virus as some already available drugs.
AIDS cannot be cured yet.
However, a combination of drugs that prevent the HIV virus from multiplying in the body can significantly prolong the lives of patients.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus multiplication also results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from VŠCHT Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with virus resistance.
They showed that substances called metallocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metallocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all drugs used today, and therefore may overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come up with new &#39;improved&#39; compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
Metallocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages made of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are linked by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease-induced cleavage of the HIV virus, mature infectious virus particles would not be produced.
When we stop the HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient&#39;s body, the scientists explain in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In the work published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is further systematically modified.
Slightly weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in a test tube and also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from patients infected with the HIV virus.
The effect of metallocarboranes on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as with clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and also their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical modifications make metallocarboranes interesting compounds for further research aimed at the design of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the Structural Biology Laboratory at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Argument over the budget. The ODS started attacking Fischer, he is defending himself
The head of the ODS, Mirek Topolánek, described the approved budget for next year as &quot;scary&quot; and, according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider its continued existence.
The Prime Minister called the ODS statement strong statements.
He says he takes time for analysis.
The vice-chairman of the ODS, Petr Nečas, said that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, the ODS and the Green Party is clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in the lower house, which is about fighting the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, Nečas pointed out.
On Wednesday, the Chamber of Deputies adopted the budget for 2010, but with left-wing amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House of Representatives increased money for the salaries of civil servants, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government&#39;s criticism of the Social Democratic proposals was that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, thereby complying with the government&#39;s wish that even the amended budget is a less bad option than the provisional budget.
Disappointment and vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will evaluate the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janot had seriously threatened to leave his post if the amendments were accepted, the situation could have looked different.
According to Czech TV, Janota made an appointment with the prime minister on Monday after the government.
At the same time, he indicated that he is considering remaining in office.
The reason is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
According to Nečas, if Fischer speaks out in favor of a further fight against the budget deficit, the ČSSD nominees, who pushed through the budget changes, have no business in the government.
The Prime Minister should also clearly state that he will resign if the Chamber of Deputies approves other deficit-increasing laws, such as those related to sick leave, pensions, or the amendment to the Service Act.
Topolánek: The ministers nominated by the ODS did not commit a crime
It is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did nothing wrong, Topolánek emphasized in a text message from the US.
He reminded that in several ministries there are people in deputy positions who belong to TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas emphasized that if Fischer decides to resign from the principle of fighting the public finance deficit, &quot;it is completely logical and correct that he leans on the left-wing majority that is currently in the Chamber&quot;.
Then, he said, he cannot count on the support and tolerance of the civil democrats.
I didn&#39;t think about it, and when it becomes relevant, I will focus on it, Minister of Defense Martin Barták, who was nominated to the government by the Citizen Democrats, told journalists in the Chamber of Deputies.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels for the meeting of the European Council.
At the Prime Minister&#39;s request, ODS backed down
At the same time, Nečas emphasized that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in the lower house on Wednesday, if the Prime Minister had not explicitly asked the members of the Citizen Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We don&#39;t feel like orphans, we&#39;re not little children, he then responded to the question whether the ODS was hampered by the absence of the party leader in the parliament and the Czech Republic during the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn&#39;t notice that my voice was missing.
Even when I was giving up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would mainly be about the Bolshevization of the Chamber and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself responded.
According to the new ČD rules, fewer trains will run for almost the same fare
From December 13, České dráhy will cancel or limit some less busy express trains and local trains, while strengthening other connections.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most tariffs, including basic and customer fares, will not change.
For example, residents of Ostrava will get more connection options to the capital, the railways will add one pendolino set to this line.
The high-speed train, on the other hand, will stop going to Bratislava.
Fewer express trains will also run on the route Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, direct connections between Prague and Letohrad will be fundamentally reduced.
Of the regions, the railways plan the biggest reduction in traffic in the Hradec Králové Region, a total of eight percent, while Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the route Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled, and the operation of several express trains on the route Prague - Písek - České Budějovice is limited to only certain days of the week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today Milovičtí have to transfer in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at the destination station Prague Hlavní nádraží.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava, and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run at two-hour intervals.
From December 13, passengers will no longer take the Pendolin to Bratislava.
This year&#39;s regional rail bill: 200 million more
Express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, a total of four billion kroner will be given to railways next year, the same as this year, to cover so-called demonstrable losses. Local companies are ordered by the regions, for which they will pay a total of eight billion crowns next year, while the state will contribute less than three billion crowns to the regions.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways have a newly concluded ten-year contract for both local and express trains, until now the contract was always for one year.
The railways praise the system, which is probably why they did not increase the prices of the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will only apply to one-day ČD Net network tickets and cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will now depend on the distance traveled, until now it was uniform for a trip between any regional cities and amounted to 160 crowns.
Filipino gunmen are still detaining over 50 people, the children have been released
Gunmen kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
This was reported by the AFP agency, which initially reported only 65 abductees.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Around 19 gunmen are said to be using the hostages as human shields while fleeing from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to negotiate the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the gunmen belong to the New People&#39;s Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, police initially pursued the kidnappers because of the violence, which was prompted by a settling of scores between two local family clans.
Martial law has been declared in the southern Philippines province of Maguindanao following a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
30 journalists were among the victims of the November 23 gubernatorial election massacre.
The governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family, were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
However, they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of JAR concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
In the next few days, Clint Eastwood&#39;s new Hollywood film Invictus (official title in Czech is Invictus: Undefeated) is coming to American cinemas, which depicts part of the life story of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter was played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose for his portrayal years ago.
Matt Damon played the supporting male role of the legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar.
With the release of the film in cinemas, they arise from the reviews of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name was Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988, he received the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought, and in 1993, together with de Klerk, he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was the President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
great expectations, as it comes to the public at a time when preparations for the World Cup in football are at their peak in South Africa, but at the same time the media is being shaken by disturbing reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination against the population by the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, responses to the new film in South Africa are generally positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the casting of the leading roles by &quot;sloppy&quot; Hollywood stars.
However, according to Morgan Freeman, he is proud of the new film.
I have dreamed about this role for many years and prepared well for it.
I also personally met Nelson Mandela many times to - as they say - draw on his energy, he said in an interview after the film&#39;s premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it&#39;s good if we can remember Mandela&#39;s personality and message with a movie.
It is a South African story, but it affects every person, he added.
In the jersey of the national rugby team
Based on the book by British writer John Carlin, loosely translated as In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made a Nation, it portrays the South African human rights advocate during his first term as president.
During the course of the film, Morgan Freeman tries to bond two racial groups of the population that have been separated from each other for many years, and just like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also enters the acting role in the South African national rugby jersey on the field of the World Cup, which South Africa won at that time.
Fourteen years ago, Mandela received a standing ovation from a predominantly white audience and won the recognition of the white population for entering the field in a jersey that is considered almost sacred in South Africa.
The football championship can perhaps bring people back together as one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only &quot;black&quot; in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve remains to be seen.
However, white South Africans are skeptical, as, for example, rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain, revealed in a recent interview with LN.
The championship will start on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns is on fire in Lounsk
In the morning, a fire engulfed the transformer of the Čeps company in the substation near the village of Výškov in Lounsko.
According to the spokesperson of the Ústí regional fire department, Lukáš Marvan, six units are responding to the fire.
Initially, the firemen wanted to let the transformer burn, but later they reconsidered their opinion and put out the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing agent.
The cause was a technical fault, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured, according to company spokesperson Pavla Mandátová, the accident does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, it will only be possible to accurately calculate it after the fire is over.
According to Mandátová, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced with a new one.
In the ten years of Čeps&#39; existence, nothing similar has happened, defects of this type are rare, she added.
According to Sonia Holingerová Hendrychová, spokeswoman for ČEZ for Northern Bohemia, electricity supplies were not interrupted, the substation fire did not affect the functioning of households, offices or companies.
As Čeps operates in the Czech Republic as the exclusive operator of the transmission system, 400 kV and 220 kV power lines.
It maintains, rehabilitates and develops 39 substations with 67 transformers converting electricity from the transmission to the distribution system and a line route of 4,339 kilometers.
Jančura will file a criminal complaint for defamation against three governors from the ČSSD
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jančura, will file a criminal complaint for defamation against three social-democratic governors today.
And that to Michal Hašek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínek from the Pardubice Region and the Governor of the Olomouc Region, Martin Tesařík.
Jančura stated this in Radiožurnál&#39;s Twenty Minutes.
The lawsuit is related to the company&#39;s efforts to operate regional train services in some regions.
All regions eventually signed long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three governors attack us and talk about us picking raisins when we only offered what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the prices of Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It is for slandering the Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
At the same time, he stated that he has evidence from all regions that they did not take their steps in accordance with European law.
He is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Hašek considers the filing of a criminal complaint to be another continuation of Mr. Jančura&#39;s media show, which serves him as free advertising for his companies and his own person.
I am understandably ready to defend my good name and that of my region, and I will challenge other governors to do the same.
I assume that even on this occasion it will become clear that it is Mr. Jančura who is manipulating the public and using lying and untrue arguments in the matter of regional rail transport, said Hašek.
Jančura already announced last week that he will invest several million crowns in advertising, which will draw attention to the disadvantageous step of the regions.
He told Radiožurnal that he will stop the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He specified that the campaign will be conducted against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jančura after the regions agreed to operate regional railway connections with the Czech Railways and did not issue tenders for a contract worth around 150 billion crowns.
According to Jančura, similar behavior is illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, a member of the ČSSD has already threatened Jančura due to his criticism of train transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we didn&#39;t let it go, we might lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a ČSSD deputy, I know who he is, I won&#39;t say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Vaccination against pneumococci will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococci from January will break old habits.
It should be the first for families to be free and at the same time optional.
But voices are already being heard that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococci are at their peak.
The Institute of Medicine already sets the maximum prices for vaccines that health insurance companies will pay.
Experts are also already clear about the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Free vaccines for August children
From January, children born on or after August 2 last year can be vaccinated against pneumococci free of charge.
The condition is that they have not yet received a single dose of vaccination.
Those who started vaccinating last year or earlier must pay for the next revaccination themselves.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child&#39;s age.
Already last year, a quarter of families voluntarily had their children vaccinated against pneumococci.
At the same time, parents paid 1,600 crowns for one dose or more.
When vaccinating the youngest children, four doses are needed.
In total, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns per year on vaccinations.
But it will save on the treatment that children without vaccination would need.
Up until now, the state has paid roughly 500,000 per year for all general vaccinations of children.
Paid vaccination was introduced by the so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcus causes otitis media, but also serious infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, up to 28 children under 10 years of age will die from pneumococcal infections in our country.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they have introduced paid universal vaccination of children against pneumococci in approximately 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, there are opinions that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January, it should be covered by insurance companies and optional.
For example, the head of the civic association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovský, indicated that compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association has been promoting pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at the international conference that our association participated in were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
It&#39;s not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that at least this was achieved.
I think this is the path we have to take now, said Kalovský.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
At the moment we are not thinking about it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Professional Society of Pediatric Practitioners, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, it could be considered to reduce the number of revaccinations.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of new parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococci starting next year.
Vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in that, as the first general vaccination of children, it is covered by health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, thereby saving on further treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy the drugs themselves
But related to this are the worries of practicing pediatricians, which are related to purchasing vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines were to be purchased by insurance companies and doctors would receive them in the same way as the state supplies them with substances for other vaccinations.
However, some MPs feared that insurance companies could &quot;take money out of health insurance&quot; in this way.
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the substances and wait for the insurance companies to reimburse them.
According to estimates, individual pediatricians will invest 40 thousand per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It won&#39;t be easy at all, says Cabrnochová.
American artist&#39;s son &#39;stealed from museum&#39;
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of attempting to heist $20 million (£12 million) worth of paintings from his father&#39;s museum.
Police in Pennsylvania say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
The named Mr. Frazetta and a second man used a backhoe to break into a museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Sr., aged 81, is best known for creating the characters of Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time it happened, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press reported.
The AP cited an unnamed police official as saying Mr. Frazetta Jr. may have been motivated by long-standing family disputes.
Mr. Frazetta Jr., 52, gave a sworn statement to police that he did so on his father&#39;s instructions &quot;to get into the museum by any means possible and move the paintings to the malting areas,&quot; the agency said.
Mr. Frazetta Sr. denied granting any such permission, the agency said.
Labor is resisting planned tax increases
Ministers defended the tax hike and spending cuts announced in the preliminary budget report against criticism from the opposition, business and unions.
As Alistair Darling put it, the Tories &quot;missed&quot; an opportunity to show they were serious about postponing a decision on deficit reduction until after the election.
Even the chancellor has come under fire for the disability of low and middle income workers.
According to his proposal, it is mainly a 0.5% increase in social insurance and a 1% adjustment of public payments from 2011.
Anger over Social Security
Unions protested that low-income workers were being punished for a recession they didn&#39;t blame and warned ahead of &quot;trouble&quot;.
Social Security is being increased - an increase of around £3 trillion a year - which has angered the business community, who say it is a tax on employment while the focus should be on recovering the economy.
This increase, limited to those earning more than £20,000 a year, will affect around 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF PBR
Social Security will increase by a further 0.5% from April 2011
The economic situation will worsen more than expected by 4.75% this year
New taxation of 50% of bankers&#39; bonuses
A 1% increase in company tax for depreciation for small businesses
Tax reduction for electric cars and wind farms
Increase in pension assessment by 2.5%
According to the Inland Revenue estimate, some incomes of £30,000 will fall by £90 a year and some incomes of £40,000 will fall by £190, while some incomes of £10,000 will increase by £110.
Ministers announced that their target to halve the deficit by 2013 meant &quot;difficult decisions&quot;, but insisted that 60% of special taxes should go to the top 5% of earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied the proposed tax hike and spending cuts were a &quot;drop in the ocean&quot; compared to what would need to be done.
&quot;These are big numbers. They will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is an absolutely basic requirement for the next four years,&quot; he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he believed the economy should pick up around the turn of the year.
But forecasting future economic growth - which will affect the amount of borrowing needed and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the chancellor was forced to revise earlier figures.
In his opinion, he said the economy contracted by 4.75% this year - far worse than the 3.5% decline forecast in April - as borrowing was £3tn higher than previously estimated.
A missed opportunity&#39;
The Conservatives, who launched a new campaign warning on Thursday of Labour&#39;s &quot;debt crisis&quot;, described the planned £789tn of borrowing over the next six years as unsustainable.
Ministers have failed to put forward a credible plan for how it could be repaid, they added, &quot;cynically&quot; delaying the decision until after the election - which must be held by June 2010.
&quot;They have not added anything significant that is actionable,&quot; said shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond. “They had an opportunity to do it, but they blew it.
&quot;Any important announcements will be made after the election if we win it&quot;
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labor insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, contrary to Tory proposals to reduce the deficit faster and more widely.
But the Lib Dems say the money raised by raising taxes and cutting spending should be used to support spending next year and not to reduce the deficit, arguing the plans are &quot;built on sand&quot;.
The BBC&#39;s political commentator Nick Robinson said of the timing of the announcement - for example, the aforementioned inflation will rise and there will be an inability to pay benefits next April - that it could lead to accusations against the chancellor in the election campaign if the money was difficult to recover a year later.
But Labor insists special help will be provided if people need it badly and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
Suspicious Budget&#39;
While ministers did not release details of spending beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that the reduction in public spending would only be the start of medium-term austerity.
The respected Institute for Budgetary Studies said the chancellor&#39;s figures indicated substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education and defense in the future.
&quot;It&#39;s really very painful so far,&quot; said its director Robert Chote.
&quot;Any major announcements will come after the election, if we win it,&quot; added Roger Bootle, an economic adviser to accountants Deloitte.
&quot;That was the suspect preliminary budget report. Markets are realizing it.&quot;
FBI Investigates &#39;American Prisons in Pakistan&#39;
The FBI is investigating five Americans suspected of links to extremists in a prison in Pakistan.
The men were jailed for the attack on a house in Sargodha, in the eastern Punjab province, the US Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it is investigating whether they are the same men who were reported missing last month from their residence in the US state of Virginia.
The US State Department said it was also about obtaining information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani origin, one of them has Egyptian ancestry and the others are from Yemen.
&quot;If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and under what circumstances they were there,&quot; spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency had been notified of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
&quot;We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are indeed the missing students,&quot; she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested at a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
It said the house had always been the focus of local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the men arrested.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters reported, but said the United States must &quot;work much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train individuals.&quot;
The five students were reported missing from their home in Northern Virginia by their families in late November.
Denial of amnesty for Iranian abusers.
The situation in respect of human rights in Iran is as bad as it has been in the last 20 years, according to the report of the group Amnesty International.
The report details the regime&#39;s &quot;torture methods&quot; before and after the disputed presidential election in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied the above criticism of this report on human rights compliance.
Officials described the criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people have been jailed and dozens killed following the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the biggest street demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of them were remanded in custody, and prosecutors sentenced the last five to death.
The BBC&#39;s Tehran correspondent, John Leyne, who is now in London, said that earlier in the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khomeini had declared some forms of torture illegal and banned them from being carried out at Karizak Correctional Facility.
But since then, almost no criticism of the legal authority has been tolerated, as our correspondent reported.
false confession&#39;
Amnesty International cited a report by 26-year-old IT student Ibrahim Methari, who said he was charged for &quot;working with Facebook&quot; and protesting the election results.
&quot;They often hit me in the face,&quot; he said in his testimony.
&quot;They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened me with execution and humiliated me.&quot;
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was detained after the election after protests and was tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
Senior Iranian government officials denied allegations of rape, but admitted that torture had taken place.
Amnesty also reported the case of a former prisoner who said he was held in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in Kahrizak prison.
Amnesty acknowledged that Iran&#39;s parliament and judiciary had set up committees to investigate the post-election unrest and the government&#39;s response, but said the bodies&#39; mandate and powers were unclear and the findings of parliamentary committees were rarely published.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to transform a landmark in Bristol into a downhill track for the race.
The park&#39;s race track attracted 16 semi-pro skiers and snowboarders to compete for cash prizes.
At the top of the ski run at Brandon Hill Park, there was a short ski jump before the 100m ski run.
Fourth-year medical student John Hickman said it was a wonderful view from the top of the ski slope, but that it was truly daunting.
It was a beautiful view of the twinkling lights of the city below.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from around the country - some of them real talent,&quot; he added.
Prizes were awarded for the best stunts - or maneuvers on the piste.
After Thursday night&#39;s race, the snow was left to melt.
Still them and us
Can a Muslim be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters are calling for a ban on minarets and general alarmist reports are spreading about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic has written and reported on whether Muslims can integrate - and do integrate - into one of of the continent&#39;s most open secular societies.
After reading this book, some readers became admirers of the author&#39;s latest work, Why the French Don&#39;t Like Headscarves (2006), an elegant and debated study of contentious issues that have divided and occupied the country for 15 years and whose effects are being felt still today.
Mr. Bowen&#39;s latest book is broader and more ambitious in scope.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened at the base.
He spent months in the mosques, schools and institutes that now cater to France&#39;s 5-6 million Muslims, what Mr Bowen calls &quot;Islamic spaces&quot;.
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students about the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about gay development and rights?
can a muslim woman marry a non muslim man?
Does a Muslima have the right to use the interest-oriented banking system if she wants to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane contentious issues that are debated and are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas that preoccupy the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other well-known figures, not least Tariq Ramadan, an Arab, Muslim scholar and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a discussion about how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society at the same time.
They have no arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are distrustful of the real idea of French or European Islam.
Philosophers and activists interviewed by Mr. Bowen are inclined to believe that it is the opposite of the Salafis—followers of purist Sunni Islam, united in Saudi Arabia—a small but influential group among European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
He wonders how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite who so staunchly defend the lay public) are really committed to the idea of pluralism.
He is of the opinion that Muslims probably have less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than the development of pragmatism, he found a &quot;tightening of the screws of values&quot;.
Can a Muslim be French? After reading this book one may be inclined to say &quot;Yes, but not now.&quot;
The most bleak prospects in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than the rest of the planet&#39;s environment.
The bounding ice is melting at an alarming rate, affecting animals and their survival like nowhere else.
The interests of the oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on the new natural sources of water, along with diplomats, lawyers and writers in awakening them.
In On Thin Ice, author and illustrator Richard Ellis describes the natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Well versed in the complicated history and practices of whaling, he describes the long tradition of polar explorers attempting to capture the polar bear.
Admiral Nelson&#39;s encounter with a brave fourteen-year-old lifeguard who fought with only a musket butt is indeed a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears swimming behind the bodies of their just-killed mothers were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears performed in one circus tent at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures typically have an area a million times smaller than the area available to adults in the wild. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Drawing on the work of other writers and historians, Mr. Ellis often returns to the threat of hunters endangering the survival of species.
Although hunting is banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where they hunt from helicopters and Indians on skis, all armed with powerful assault rifles with which to blast their prey.
The irony is that this takes place in the water to the north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will end up being the largest.
In his new book &quot;After the Ice&quot;, Alun Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and dismal account of science&#39;s responsibility for the Arctic and an engaging glimpse of how the future may change it.
Scientists do not have answers to everything.
Not even meteorologists and oceanographers have an adequate answer to the speed of change.
That&#39;s for lack of exams.
The research trips of Fridtjof Nansen in the late 19th and early 20th centuries first indicated how floating ice moves.
Cold War submarines then charted the shifting divides as they sailed under them.
Satellite surveying and large arrays of probes in floating glaciers are useful additions, but much is still done by intrepid individuals camping out in the winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinarily fragile world of a percolation system¨within Arctic ice, created by the flow of saltwater that contracts as it freezes.
But from the aforementioned bear to the microscopic wonders within, all are doomed once the summer ice moves, which will happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months...that could be us&#39;
6,000 Marines laid wreaths at Arlington graves
Petty Officer De&#39;Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, it was a day to pay tribute to the men and women who once wore the same shoes.
In a few months when we embark, it could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would want someone to do the same for me, to show me the respect that I am trying to show.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered that Saturday morning to lay wreaths at the Veterans Cemetery in several departments in a memorial service in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Funeral Home in Harrington, Maine, started this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves at an Arlington memorial service.
Now an 18-year-old tradition, Mr nMorill and his wife Karen make the journey every year, stopping at various towns along the way to honor the memory of members of the military and victims of terrorism.
Worcestersters are not looking for profit in this, wreaths across America that they lay in other states as well.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths at Arlington Cemetery, the Pentagon grounds, Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation is donating more than $150,000 to purchase and ship wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, who was a member of the armed forces.
Because her husband is not buried at Arlington, Ms. Hunt said it was her way of giving back to what makes a sacrifice.
It&#39;s a small way citizens can support our troops, she said.
It&#39;s like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in cloaks made of warm fabric, the volunteers walked through the cemetery on the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed to older graves from World War I, II and the Vietnam War, as these are not visited as often as newer graves
The mood was positive as the children played and held hands together as they carried the young pine tree to the gray headstones.
Each circular wreath was dark green with a small red bow around the top.
Nearby § in Ward 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, it was really quiet.
The Associated Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate the ward, but the somber mood of the ongoing wars filled the area.
Some wept sincerely, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names carved into the stones, while others bent down to examine small black-and-white name tags pushed into the wet mud where headstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who wiped tears from her eyes at her son&#39;s grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the final resting place of Marine Artillery Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who was killed in action in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . .my son paid for it, she said.
&quot;Even though I&#39;ve been gone for a long time, I want to be the one to remember him.&quot;
US government contractor imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has jailed a U.S. government contractor who was importing cellphones and laptops into the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the US Interest Section in Havana, sought access to the detainee, who was jailed on December 5.
Specific charges have not been made public, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreign national can be jailed for almost anything deemed &quot;dangerous.&quot;
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical states, carry the risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious offences.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being followed and harassed by government agents.
Ms. Sánchez repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to accept the awards, but was denied permission.
The detention of the US supplier may be a result of growing tensions between the communist Castro brother, who rules Cuba, and the Obama administration, which has been seen as a &quot;delaying tactic&quot; in improving relations with the island.
The New York Times first reported the incarceration Friday night.
The new US policy emphasized that if the Cuban government took concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, the United States would take reciprocal steps.
Cell phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average salary of a civil servant is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy cell phones just this year; these are mostly used for texting, as a 15-minute phone call would cost more than a day&#39;s wages.
Internet usage on the island is extremely limited.
It is available at expensive hotels and their foreign visitors and at some government connections such as universities.
Cubans who often want to apply must report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the handful of US citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for felonies such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berben, press officer for the US Interests Section in Havana.
Ms. Berben said she could not provide more information about the jail.
Imprisonment and detention were clearly immoral.
Activities that would be legal in any other open society -- say free cell phones -- are criminal in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. Human Rights Watch&#39;s program, which recently released a scathing report on freedoms in Cuba called &quot; New Castro, same Cuba,&quot; in reference to the installation of Raul Castro as the country&#39;s leader and replacement for ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said defendants are often arrested, tried and jailed in one day.
He said that any solutions would be more political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States just as the two countries are moving toward greater dialogue.
Pakistani civil servants uncover a plot to send men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday unveiled the alleged ringleader of a plot to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops there, saying they hoped the case could help unravel a vast network of terrorist recruiters that prowl the Internet and seeks radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for a gray insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one of the men posted a comment endorsing terror attacks on YouTube.
Saifillah took charge of these men once they came to Pakistan, tried to help them reach a remote area of Pakistan in the tribal belt of Pakistan that is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who reported on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had been unsuccessful in convicting al-Qaida commanders and that the men were not part of a CIA attempt to infiltrate the terror network.
As a result, they were dropped for several days in the eastern district of Sarghoda, far away from the menacing mountains in the northwest, which have become a haven for terrorists.
They were considered a strike force.
The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case, said why they were dropped.
The official said the men had not been intimidated and were still trying to get approval to gain access to al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of the five - who remained in Pakistan and were questioned by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determining who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, US intelligence has assigned the highest priority to attempts to place human assets in al-Qaeda.
The organization&#39;s recruiters act as sentinels, weeding out those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the holy war and those who might be spies.
American fake recruits were subjected to special scrutiny at al-Qaida, analysts said.
But they were also considered particularly interesting in the group because of their potential access to American targets and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become considerably more cautious in recent years about allowing the koh to approach them as US intelligence agencies have gained expertise in their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to penetrate these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has been watched so much? stated Mr. Kohlmann.
This model is one that is far more web-based.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate &#39;action&#39;
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets this Saturday demanding stronger climate action from negotiators at the city&#39;s Bella Convention Centre.
Protesters put the number in the hundreds of thousands at the event, but police believe the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, with a handful of masked activists placing several small bombs near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day of the minor incident at the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city carrying placards reading &quot;This is not Planet B&quot; in English and one in Spanish that read &quot;Earth Says &#39;Enough&#39; .&quot;
Several celebrities took part in the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said she had traveled to her mother&#39;s birthplace in Peru and told me about the bleak state of the country due to the ongoing effects of climate change.
That is part of the reason why we decided to join this great march -- to go around the world and appeal to world leaders to put forward a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it cannot be avoided all the time.
Police prevented protesters from approaching the Bell Center and said they detained 19 people, primarily because they were either wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one bystander, who did not want to be identified because he is involved in the climate talks, activists disguised as athletes and wearing black suits planted several bombs near Copenhagen&#39;s main canal, which is near several ministries.
They agitated the buildings, he said, starting with flares, but then there were &quot;several big explosions.&quot;
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest is unlikely to have penetrated the consciousness of key officials such as Su Wei, China&#39;s chief climate negotiator.
When he was asked whether the demonstration nevertheless had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he answered in English &quot;Actually, that is something that I was not aware of&quot;.
Then he continued in Chinese and said &quot;Because the venue is so big, I can&#39;t hear what&#39;s going on outside&quot;.
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful depending on everyone&#39;s outlook.
You can see the focus of the general public and different sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: &quot;It can also be said that it is a violation of the conduct or freedom of other persons.
The test data revealed persistent, persistent racial disparities
Last week&#39;s federal math certificate of achievement was a welcome bit of good news for District of Columbia public education.
Although the district lags far behind the nation&#39;s high-performing systems, the report showed more progress among fourth- and eighth-graders over the past two years than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers from the National Certification Center for the Advancement of Teaching are persistent gaps in achievement between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score for white fourth-graders in the District of Columbia rose from 267 to 270 points (out of a possible 500) over the past two years, but their African-American peers only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in knowledge achievement actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
Eighth-grade African-American progress remains broadly flat, with a statistically insignificant one-point shift from 245 to 245.
The mean score for white students was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture in six years is not exactly encouraging.
The gap between white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the district&#39;s first NAEP was administered, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
Although the achievement of children in both groups improved during this period, the difference hardly approached 58.
Some education advocates in the district have said in the past week that the results, celebrated by Secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D), were a bigger boost to white students where achievement was already high.
That would suggest that we have increased the aggregate support of those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and troubling, said Jeff Smith, executive director of DC Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for educational equity in the district.
I&#39;m not jumping up and down because of a two or three point variance, said D.C. Committeewoman Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a fourth-grade daughter at Eaton Elementary.
A frequent critic of Ms Rhee&#39;s management style, Ms Brown said the report on the test results meant the city&#39;s secondary education system was in dire straits and needed attention.
Obviously you always want to see the positives and I respect that.
But what is appalling is that we have devoted almost none of the time and energy that should be devoted to our secondary education.
Ms. Rhee said the district&#39;s goal is to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-achieving students.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at upper elementary and middle school students who have failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their school careers and are significantly behind their peers.
Everyday math and a sixth-grade math curriculum emphasizing games and real-life experiences that came to the district under former principal Clifford Janeyi can be credited to NAEP&#39;s progress reported last week.
And I just think we should continue to work and make the best possible interventions for those students who remain below grade level, Ms. Rhee said.
Others said the NAEP results shed light on whether Ms. Rhee can continue to raise the system&#39;s overall performance and still provide the additional money and resources to low-performing schools needed to close the gap.
It&#39;s a particular dilemma for Ms. Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies test scores in urban areas.
The conventional remedy is to focus resources and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia.
Thus, the focus can have political reverberations that go against an important agenda.
But the blame also belongs to the other city managers who try to maintain the average between whites and blacks.
We must focus on building a system of great schools.
We must strengthen the kinship of our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can count on an excellent public education for their children.
Mr. Janey, now Newark&#39;s superintendent of schools, said in an interview this week that a key element in reducing the achievement gap is extending the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, to make the schools eligible.
You have to get up to 200 days to push through the changes, said Mr. Janey, who signed a contract with his teachers union last year for a 185-day school year, which he sees as a &quot;sign&quot; to seek a bigger raise next year.
Making higher education part of a better future
The tour bus pulled into Gettysburg College with a loud gasp.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stepped out and rested for a moment on the white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Graciel&#39;s parents barely graduated from college in El Salvador.
Until now, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, had never set foot on the dormitory grounds.
Now she and the other eighth-graders in the group were exploring Gettysburg, where tuition was $38,690 a year, their status as enthusiastic prospective students rather than apprehensive visitors.
Yes! This is it! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, as the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? she said thoughtfully as they were told the low ratio of professors to students.
Pennsylvania College was one of seven they had visited on their three-day tour, and now they were completely engrossed in the news to come: The question is not whether you enter the college.
The question is from where.
But that&#39;s a major problem with the high number of US-born children of Spanish immigrants who get kicked out of college or get pregnant as underage, but there are hundreds of thousands who get a college education and thus enter the middle class.
Virtually one-fifth of this &quot;long generation&quot; of Spanish college students — a remarkable achievement — indicates that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexican and Central American, made it to the United States without finishing college.
Their success story is important, the researchers say, because it underscores their point of a way forward for a generation that played a marginal role in the country&#39;s workforce.
Those who have achieved higher education say they had a natural affinity for school and an innate drive and drive to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and sought ways to compensate for the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciela and the millions of kids who would like to graduate from college — especially if these efforts are sustained over time.
Given that children come from low-income backgrounds whose parents don&#39;t have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any simple intervention at every single point won&#39;t fix it, says Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American region.
We need to think about giving these kids a safety net in preschool in every way they can to make it through college.
The federal program that funded Graciela&#39;s tour of the dorms is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million annually to local school systems to launch college preparation programs that begin for low-income students in high school and continue until those students graduate from college.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, more than 10% of whom have entered college, according to the US Department of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum Industry has reached an agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite fears of violence and political instability, Iraq&#39;s government managed to get major oil companies to rebuild its ailing infrastructure in two auctions on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been signed by Iraq&#39;s Ministry of Petroleum Industry with foreign oil companies, indicating that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are poised to play a major role in reviving Iraq&#39;s oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies left with capital participation in just two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven US companies paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one submitted a losing bid.
Two US companies reached agreements for the fields, which were auctioned in June.
The scant participation of American oil giants in Iraq&#39;s open oil industry has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, you have Asians and Europeans in the first row here, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news outlet.
It will be long before anything else is for sale in Iraq.
Security concerns, highlighted by the massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the US military, are likely to deter American companies from doing much more intensive business in Iraq, which is proven to have the third-largest raw material reserves, analysts say.
American firms have been at a disadvantage in some cases, especially since Chinese and other government-controlled energy firms have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to enter into agreements with the Department.
Leading US firms such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which had maintained close ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum and offered technical assistance in previous years, left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts that were awarded at the end of this week.
State-owned China National Petroleum Corp. it bid for more contracts than any other company and walked away with large stakes in two major field contracts.
We all know that China is striving to become a major economic as well as technological power, said Assam Petroleum Ministry spokesman Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be comparable to the competition and live up to its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that were pre-selected to submit bids were then compared by the ministry on price per barrel and what the ministry is willing to pay to boost output above current levels at each field.
Top al Qaeda planner apparently killed in Pakistan.
A top al Qaeda operative was apparently killed in a US missile strike near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border this week, US counterterrorism officials said Friday.
As confirmed, this could be the second fatal attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs killed when multiple rockets hit their car near the town of Miran Şah in North Waziristan province on Thursday, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities said the rockets were fired from an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA in the lawless tribal belt.
These were pointed to a white car that was heading towards the Afghan border when it was hit, said an official with Pakistan&#39;s civilian intelligence agency, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The official said local gunmen rushed to the spot and quickly confiscated what was left of the &quot;totally mutilated bodies&quot;.
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two US counterterrorism officials cited an unspecified witness who said Somali was near death.
Somali was reported to be a high-ranking al-Qaeda military operations planner who directed the terrorist group&#39;s operations outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in plotting around the world, said a senior official who did not want to be named, citing the sensitive nature of US airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
If he held such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from the top leadership of Al-Qaeda and planned possible terrorist attacks based on them.
Another US official said Somali had risen quickly through al-Qaida&#39;s hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not have been a household name to some Americans, but that he was in no way condescending to pose in front of us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second high-ranking al-Qaida or Taliban leader to be killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmudin Jalolov, the leader of the militant faction in the tribal belt, and three other top post-operational leaders.
The pace of CIA-launched drone strikes has dropped since the summer from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to the Long War Journal, a website maintained by the nonprofit group.
The reduction may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also mercilessly killing those they suspect of being informers, the site said.
The top delegate of the United Nations in Kabul resigned.
The top United Nations envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would like to step down from his post in March, ending a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan&#39;s UN-backed presidential election.
Eide&#39;s departure comes as the Obama administration decided to send an additional 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN delegate said he supported the increase but expressed concern that the US drawdown timetable, which starts in 18 months, should prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the building of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans that they should have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The accepted commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian staff helping Afghanistan&#39;s political transformation.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be replicated on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has now said he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it is high time to look for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor&#39;s departure and my arrival.
Ban has launched a search for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials said they were deciding between Staffan di Mistura, who is of Swedish-Italian descent and previously headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide&#39;s position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was accused in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the country&#39;s presidential election, of concealing the presence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the claims, but said the allegations against Galgraith -- who was released -- &quot;definitely hurt the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism about international interference&quot; in the election.
Eide said he was proposing a meeting with the top civilian representative to coordinate relief efforts with the leadership of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He has also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries to lend to the Afghan mission, as he says he wants to boost their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the curtailment of its efforts in Afghanistan, saying that cumbersome UN hiring regulations undermined its ability to use capabilities.
The UN rules are such that I have been able to get only one person since May, he said.
This is a disaster and I can&#39;t go on.
Gates: Iran faces more sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose &quot;additional significant sanctions&quot; on Iran over its lack of engagement in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a group of about 300 US troops in northern Iraq during a weeklong tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, played down the prospect of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good option for Iran, he said in response to a soldier&#39;s question about likely developments. ¨
One of the things that depends on me is if I&#39;ve learned anything from Iraq over the last six years, [it] is the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could hit Iran&#39;s military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of those sanctions could also hit ordinary Iranians.
He said an &quot;incentives and deterrent package&quot; would be required &quot;to make the Iranian government really feel less safe with nuclear weapons&quot; because &quot;its people will suffer tremendously&quot; from sanctions.
According to a statement issued Friday by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration engaged European leaders in warning that Iran would face serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the United Nations Nuclear Security Committee and its watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it only wants to develop its expertise for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on October 1, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks on curbing his nuclear program and agreed to give up a substantial part of his stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed reactor fuel to carry out medical research.
The administration advocated for such a deal as a way to build trust between the two sides and buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to be backing away from the interim agreements -- in part, the expert says, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, when it comes to Iran&#39;s stubbornness with the international community on some of the proposals that he actually agreed to in early October, I think that has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together on a path that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians. Gates said.
President Obama set a Dec. 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals before returning to seeking other options, including monitoring what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called &quot;degrading sanctions.&quot;
In a statement issued in New York, Iran&#39;s mission to the United Nations on Thursday condemned what it called &quot;baseless and baseless allegations&quot; made by some members of the Security Council about Iran&#39;s nuclear activities and said it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers. &quot;in order to achieve a reasonable long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdistan region to meet with troops in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
High tensions remain between the Kurds and Iraq&#39;s Arab majority, particularly over borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to avoid delaying US plans to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to assuage Kurdish concern about the lingering depression. Official US outlets quoted Gates as telling Massoud Barzaani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: &quot;We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don&#39;t want to leave you.&quot;
In an aging China, changing course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that read &quot;Mother Earth is too exhausted to support more children&quot; and &quot;One more child means one more grave&quot;.
Then they learned the lesson that when official government posts in Shanghai, alarmed by their city&#39;s low birthrate and aging population, suddenly reversed course this summer and began encouraging young couples, their response was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all our time and energy to just one child.
We left nothing for others, says Wang, 31, a human resources manager who has an 8-month-old son.
China&#39;s more than 30-year-old one-child policy has been implemented, creating two generations of only notoriously chubby and spoiled children, affectionately nicknamed &quot;little emperors,&quot; and the country is threatened by a population crisis.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared with six before the policy took effect, according to UN data.
A breakdown of the population, where the number of people aged 60 and over is predicted to skyrocket from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. That&#39;s well above the overall average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater in wealthy coastal cities with university-educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over made up nearly 22 percent of Shanghai&#39;s registered population, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Commission for Population and Family Planning, said many couples must have children to &quot;help reduce the proportion of the aging population and the shrinking workforce in the future&quot;.
He says it&#39;s about &quot;being old doesn&#39;t mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden&quot;.
Gradual calming down
Enshrined in the country&#39;s constitution in 1978, China&#39;s one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced under Communist Party rule to this day.
Couples who violated the policy faced hefty fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and job discrimination.
Chinese officials have pushed for policies that have helped the country prevent critical depletion of natural resources, while human rights advocates have been condemned for pushing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to have second-child abortions.
Additionally, many couples had to undergo sexist selective abortions, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of males to females.
In past years, population officials have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they generally allowed a number of exceptions -- including urban dwellers, members of national minorities and cases where a man and a woman were only children -- and in 2007 they softened the diction of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Peking University&#39;s Institute of Population Research, said central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, posters urging parents to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing how it would be permissible to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at their homes and slip flyers under their doors.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial counseling for those who choose to have more than one child.
The response has been chilly, family planning officials said.
A sad response
Although officials in one rural town around Shanghai saw an increase in interest from couples wanting to have a second child after the campaign began, most urban precincts reported no changes.
Huinan Municipal District, with a population of 115,000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city is still expected to be only around 165,000 in 2010 - slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai&#39;s Caolu district, said financial considerations were probably the main reason why people did not want to have more children.
They want to provide the best for the first child, he stated.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and were legally allowed to.
But like many Chinese who only have inadequate health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social safety net, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge the one-child policy as a contentious legal issue, says Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with their first child.
Yes, we were deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just politics.
It&#39;s about money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, a human resources manager, says they only want one child because she, too, was an only child: &quot;We were the center of attention in our families and everyone took care of us.
We weren&#39;t used to providing care and didn&#39;t really want to care for others.
Chen Zijian, 42, who owns a translation company, put it more bluntly.
For middle-class, two-career parents who have reduced birth rates, he said, being successful means being selfish.
Today&#39;s 20- and 30-somethings see their parents as pushing through the early days of China&#39;s experiment with capitalism, and they don&#39;t want that livelihood for themselves, he says.
Just one child makes enormous demands on the parents&#39; time, he says.
The mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the questionable questions of the propstor -- &quot;You have to rebuild your apartment&quot; -- and the strategy -- &quot;You have to have a resume ready by the time the child is 9 months old for a good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, Che says, but not two.
We are the first generation with higher food standards, he says.
We don&#39;t want to make too many sacrifices.
UN group outlines plan to cut emissions.
The U.N.-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by largely unruly attitudes and finger-pointing -- focused again on Friday on releasing a document that proposes ambitious cuts in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations bearing most of the burden in the near future.
The text, which may provide a starting point for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, highlights remaining obstacles as well as illuminating a way forward.
But important progress was seen in the ill-timed talks with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Created by a UN ad hoc working group, the text subtly outlines how much money rich countries should give poor ones to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a range of choices on key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies to limit their carbon output and what should be the upper limit of global temperature increase that policymakers will still be able to tolerate.
That adds a lot of flexibility to the process, says John Coequyt, senior director of the Sierra Club of Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, condenses 180 pages of text from the talks to focus on what the UN&#39;s top climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as the &quot;big picture&quot;.
It outlines a possible deal in which industrialized nations could collectively cut their emissions to 25 to 45 percent below 1990 levels within a year, while major developing countries could cut their emissions to 15 to 30 percent over that period.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 percent.
The European Union negotiated a fast-track Friday pledge to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries embrace climate change adaptation -- from managing floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
But Friday still unleashed the same kind of verbal fireworks that dominated the talks last week.
US special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected the speech, calling for binding greenhouse gas emissions reductions for industrialized countries versus voluntary ones for major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The move signaled that the Obama administration has taken a tougher line toward China than Bush administration officials took just two years ago.
The United States will not accede to the treaty without the transfer of major developing countries and implementation of actions, said Stern, who also complained that the text was not sufficient to secure the restrictions and should be vetted by outside observers.
Stern made the comments an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei told the U.S. chief climate negotiator that either a lack of &quot;common sense&quot; or &quot;extraordinary irresponsibility&quot; led him to say earlier in the week that the United States would not financially help China to could deal with global warming.
With the future of the economic trajectory of the world&#39;s major powers at stake, tussles have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is mostly about preserving individual economies rather than preserving the planet, between China and the United States over meeting their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that two dozen of the world&#39;s most powerful countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take stronger action.
Ricardo Ulate, Costa Rica&#39;s delegate, said it&#39;s not surprising that major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of curbing greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in finding ways to hold big emitters accountable for their actions.
It&#39;s clearly a play that a new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also serves as a regional adviser on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change have indicated they would like to continue pushing for a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants said the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The 43-member alliance of small island states produced a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said the small island nation&#39;s push &quot;has put political pressure on the whole political process&quot; in part because they are now united in demanding action from growing economies such as China and India.
The talks took on new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the remaining contentious issues before the heads of government vie for a deal.
High-ranking officials, such as India&#39;s environment minister Jairam Ramesh and China&#39;s deputy minister, stepped off planes and walked through the halls of the Bella Center to closed-door meetings and new conferences so they could lay out the claims to be considered next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering - with 13,000 people moving daily behind the convention center, guitar-playing activists staging ironic spectacles at night about the countries they believed had sent them, and proposals being passed from hand to hand on paper rather than electronically by mail -- controlled by challenge.
The intensity is only a superstructure: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen, and earlier on Wednesday 60 heads of state.
We got into the high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said Assistant Secretary for Global Policy at International Conservation.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain&#39;s first 140mph train redefined sensation this Monday
at 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle cut through the darkness to signal the departure of a train that revolutionized transport in Britain.
The country&#39;s first high-speed passenger train will reach speeds of 140mph and fly from Ashford, Kent, to London&#39;s St Pancras, covering a distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Secretary, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and boarded the first high-speed passenger train outside London.
He hopes the new service will eventually link Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland with London.
Neglected backwaters should reduce transit times on passenger and commercial routes, and a shift from airplanes and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road congestion.
In theory, the three main political parties have been won over to this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle for projects and concerns about environmental damage have now slowed the building of Britain&#39;s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company formed in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, delivered its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times reported.
She provided him with a detailed map of the routes of the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
The new route linking London to the West Midlands has been proposed to within five meters in urban areas and neighborhoods where environmental impact could be problematic.
In the open countryside, up to 25 m of the final route was planned.
HS2 also envisages identifying three options for an extensive high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped configuration where one high-speed line would run into the West Midlands.
The line should split near Birmingham with one branch running from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other heading north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
&quot;It looks like the most efficient choice has been made,&quot; said a railroad expert.
Once completed, journey times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not open until 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to more than an hour at present.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at speeds of 2,250 miles per hour, making Britain&#39;s network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line is already being designed to carry 400 m long trains, which would be able to carry 1,100 people.
Up to 18 trains could operate every hour on the London - Birmingham route.
It means that the London terminal would be able to handle up to 20,000 passengers per hour if needed.
Due to capital constraints, it is envisaged that the existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement the scheme, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be made before the general election.
Even if it sets the wheels in motion, the network should be built piecemeal.
Trains should initially operate not on high-speed lines but on existing lines north of Birmingham, keeping journey times between London and Scotland above three hours.
It is considered a crucial juncture to ensure the transition from planes to trains, a landmark for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers paid £75,000 mortgage on Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, the Tory backbencher in the House of Commons, was paid thousands of pounds by the taxpayer last year for an orangery he built at his home in the constituency.
The party&#39;s prisons spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living &quot;on rations&quot;, has increased his mortgage to £75,000 to build an oak-paneled extension to his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge special interest, totaling hundreds of pounds a month to taxpayers.
The municipal authorities approved the claims in time and so he was not questioned by Sir Thomasen Legge, who was carrying out a review of members&#39; expenses. Last night Mr Duncan made his demands &quot;it couldn&#39;t be cleaner or simpler&quot;.
Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns two two-storey country houses in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The houses are worth around a million pounds.
There is a kitchen, living room and dining room on the ground floor, but the tax office agreed that Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a conservatory to the house, which is marked as an &quot;orangery&quot; in the plans.
Neighbors describe it as a &quot;greenhouse for fun and entertainment&quot;.
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last review by the Municipal Standards and Privileges Committee in the last mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month that he had broken the rules, following a review of his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan swapped the pupil security for a £271,406 mortgage on his London property for a home in his constituency, which he bought in 1991, a year before he became an MP.
Documents released this week showed Mr Duncan was claiming around £1,400 a month in interest on the mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims rose to more than £1,800 a month.
The interest on Mr Duncan&#39;s RBS mortgage repayments could not have changed at this time, suggesting it was all intended to fund the £75,000 loan.
RBS standard variable mortgage repayments fell from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, where it has remained.
The latest council document shows Mr Duncan continued to claim £1,250 a month in May this year.
Mr Duncan left his job as shadow leader of the House in September after an undercover whistleblower filmed him saying MPs were living &quot;on rations&quot; following the expenses scandal.
&quot;It&#39;s basically nationalized, you have to live on rations and you&#39;re treated like s**t.&quot;
He said: “I spent money on my garden and claim and a small fraction on what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won&#39;t.&quot;
The MP, a millionaire from a former career as an oil trader, was first called on to explain his expenses in May when it emerged he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, before the tax office approved it &quot;may be considered excessive&quot;.
One campaigner dug a pit in the shape of a pound sign in Mr Duncan&#39;s lawn in protest after it was revealed he had claimed £4,000 over three years.
Asked about the mortgage increase last night, Mr Duncan said: &quot;It was for a capital increase, which was approved by both the Inland Revenue and subsequently by Legg.&quot;
He added: &quot;It&#39;s not a contentious issue of hiding and looping or breaking the rules or anything.
It&#39;s absolutely a straight line down, according to the rules, justified and that&#39;s it.
It couldn&#39;t be cleaner or simpler in many other ways&quot;.
Come and take a close look at the cottage on the Brighton coast with the advent calendar.
Brighton&#39;s seaside cottages have found new meaning in the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages creative living, invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages for each day in December, using the Christmas wreath as a theme.
The event began on December 1, allowing visitors to view the last hut from 5.30pm to 6.30pm each day, and with free bishop&#39;s sandwiches and mulled wine.
Selected carols included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, with the cottage featuring the work of Janetta Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a non-stipendiary priest in the Diocese of Chichester and head of Beyond.
He said: &quot;We want to make religion much more important to people in a post-Christian society.
&quot;Why should we as a church expect people to come to someone else&#39;s old building? I feel that the church should come to the people and serve in a revival way.
&quot;The idea of an advent calendar in cottages came about as a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we&#39;ve tried to try and present that in a spiritual way.&quot;
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday to demand a strong and binding agreement to fight global warming to be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrating around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources, and 100,000 according to organizers, demonstrated in the cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aims to adopt an agreement by Friday, which could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, said that the growing global mobilization, of which the current demonstrations are clear evidence, contributed to the fact that the &quot;political toll&quot; of a possible failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
According to an AFP journalist, the incidents occurred in the Danish capital shortly after the start of the parade, when a group of about 300 protesters, dressed in black, began smashing shop windows with paving stones and hammers.
The riot police immediately intervened forcefully.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and specified that they were mainly members of the &quot;Blacks Blocks&quot;, ultra-radical independent groups that already manifested themselves in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested &quot;indiscriminately&quot; and emphasized that about a hundred of them were handcuffed and seated &quot;held in the streets as late as Saturday night&quot; and that despite the extreme winter.
After leaving the Parliament, the procession calmly made its way to the Bella Center, where the proceedings were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get inside.
A podium was built for the speakers, in front of which a spiritual meeting by candlelight took place with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to Africans, there were also a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Almost 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue raincoats, formed the first assembly in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create &quot;blue waves&quot; for a &quot;just climate&quot;.
Today we are taking to the streets to demand settlement of the environmental debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpilová, a Filipina campaigner from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer say to ourselves: it&#39;s time for that, declared the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
Rivers and waterways are drying up in Africa, today we can walk in them and that was never possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN convention, the movement of the fight for another world approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, one of the figures of the struggle for a different world, said that he came to Copenhagen with the aim of &quot;connecting climate and social justice&quot;. &quot;Currently there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world&quot;.
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, in which there are many islands particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
Several hundred people, mostly students, marched in Manila wearing red clothes and scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred protesters took to the streets demanding strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in protests organized by the &quot;350&quot; movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Several dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia elects its own president, Georgia condemns it as a &quot;farce&quot;
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist territory as independent from Georgia, a move Tbilisi has called a &quot;farce&quot;.
About 131,000 people were invited to take part in these first elections since the August 2008 Russo-Georgian war for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
Polling stations closed at 5pm GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission, the turnout was 58% a few hours before the polls closed.
The first preliminary results should be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including incumbent President Sergej Bagapsh, categorically reject the idea of merging with Georgia, which condemned the election.
This election is a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili &quot;regrets that Abkhazia has completely fallen under Russian rule,&quot; said his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
Besides Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After secession from Georgia, following the 1992-1993 conflict in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia is trying to show through elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, Kvarčija Svetlanová, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted that she voted for President Bagapš, told AFP.
She was one of those who came to vote at a polling station at a school in the capital Sukhumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees at the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the main topic of the presidential election in this region on the shores of the Black Sea, which boasts beautiful nature.
All over this small country of 216,000 people, there are huge billboards of Bagapsh alongside Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to oversee the successful conduct of the elections were warmly welcomed by the district mayor, Beslan Aršba.
&quot;We, the Abkhazians, are grateful,&quot; he said at a small ceremony, referring to Moscow&#39;s support and especially its decision to recognize Abkhazia&#39;s independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, toasting a glass of vodka.
The opposition, which was represented in the election by former vice-president Raul Khadzhimba and two businessmen, Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized agreements signed last year with Moscow, such as one that gives Russia control over Abkhazia&#39;s rail network for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current government or the opposition.
A supermajority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive fight must take place within two weeks.
Climate: manifestations in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday to demand a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrating around the world and in Copenhagen, where the police arrested around 700 people on that occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources, and 100,000 according to organizers, demonstrated in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which is hosting until December 18 delegates from 193 countries negotiating the agreement, which could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
After leaving the Parliament, the procession calmly made its way to the Bella Center, where the proceedings were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get inside.
A podium was built for the speakers, in front of which a spiritual meeting by candlelight took place with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
According to an AFP journalist, the incidents took place shortly after the parade left, when a group of several hundred protesters, dressed all in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began smashing shop windows.
The riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened without waiting, knocking several demonstrators to the ground.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and specified that they were mainly members of the &quot;Blacks Blocks&quot;, ultra-radical independent groups that had already manifested themselves in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
Late in the afternoon, a policeman was injured in the jaw by a paving stone and four cars were set on fire near a squat located nearby in incidents that resulted in about 20 people being detained, according to police sources.
We are focusing on extremist groups, warned police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, as police helicopters took to the air again.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus or train from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But there were also a lot of Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans and/or Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue raincoats, formed the first rally in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create &quot;blue waves&quot; for a &quot;fair climate&quot;.
Today we are taking to the streets to demand settlement of the environmental debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpilová, a Filipina campaigner from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

Oxfam has invited several well-known personalities, such as Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN High Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, to address the crowd.
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, in which there are many islands particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students in red clothes and scarves evoking the importance of solar energy, demonstrated in front of the city hall of the capital of the Philippines.
Several hundred protesters also met in Hong Kong and Jakarta demanding strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in protests organized by the &quot;350&quot; movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Several dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The subjects of geography and history will be strengthened as part of the general gymnasium reform, Chatel said.
The Minister of Education, Luc Chatel, said on Sunday during an interview with the magazine JDD that the subjects of history and geography will be &quot;strengthened&quot; as part of the general grammar school reform, even though their teaching will no longer be compulsory in the last year of grammar school with a focus on exact sciences.
Now all second-year students will have four hours a week, and there will be the same general culture program for all, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, &quot;hypocrisy must be stopped&quot; because, according to him, specialization S is no longer focused on exact sciences&quot; but &quot;in essence, it has the best students&quot;.
ES and L specializations cannot be some kind of sub-specializations for S, he continues and emphasizes: &quot;I haven&#39;t heard many historians and intellectuals complaining that they don&#39;t learn geography and history in the last year of vocational high schools&quot;.
A survey by the Ifop agency, published by the daily Humanité on Saturday, showed that seven out of ten French people (69%) do not agree with the government&#39;s project to abolish the compulsory teaching of history and geography in the high school graduation year with the specialization S, which is also why many intellectuals and teachers criticized this abolition, as the left, as well as some members of the right.
On the other hand, the Minister added that it is &quot;out of the question&quot; to cancel philosophy in the specialization program S of the matriculation year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended the reform in the education of teachers, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called to participate in Tuesday&#39;s mobilization against this project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical education of future grammar school professors.
As part of the master&#39;s degree 2 (M2), they will undergo an entrance exam focused on their field at the beginning of the year and another exam at the end of the year verifying their ability to teach, explained the minister.
They will participate in professional internships during the second year of their master&#39;s studies, and in the first year they will appear in front of the students as a professor-intern.
If you add up all the internships you will be offered before admission, you will get more experience with pupils, almost 300 hours, he continued.
The minister also announced that he would propose a &quot;personal right to education&quot;, which does not yet exist in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to abolish the school map by 2012.
At the elite École normale supérieure university, experts have 15 minutes to convince them about the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the objectives of the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge announced in the council in the morning by Jean Jouzel, co-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (GIEC) at the initiative of the Ecole normale supérieure university on Ulm street.
As an AFP journalist reported, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the &quot;Ernest&quot; conferences, which is a kind of one-day seminar consisting of fifteen-minute contributions by experts, which will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and make them want to learn more, explained 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo on the occasion of the conference, one of the organizers of this seminar, which was named after a fish from a local lake, which the students named .
About twenty contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines will be selected, and he specified that the selection is based on their charisma.
On climate warming, &quot;we can talk for hours, but we can also summarize the basic objectives in a few minutes,&quot; Jean Jouzel told AFP, speaking to an audience of 50 without pre-prepared notes, using only graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he emphasized with the hope that the listeners will recognize that &quot;the Copenhagen conference is based on very seriously prepared scientific foundations&quot;.
The videos recorded at these lectures will be posted on the school&#39;s website from December 15.
The next &quot;Ernest&quot; seminar is planned for February and others will follow with regularity every two months.
Payment delays: Angry prison guards, action planned
The unions of prison guards announced a &quot;general mobilization&quot; on Friday, as they demand that they be paid bonuses and overtime by the Christmas holidays, the payment of which was postponed until January for financial reasons.
Prison FOs (2nd Wardens Union) have asked off-duty staff to attend a demonstration outside the prison facilities on Tuesday morning to &quot;lock them out&quot; and call attention to the &quot;stealing of their wages&quot;.
The CGT for Prison Wardens (the 3rd union of this sector) called on them to &quot;call meetings in individual prisons and start a major mobilization&quot;, saying it was &quot;shameful and unacceptable&quot; that &quot;overtime and extra pay for working at night, on Sundays and holidays&quot; worked in October, were not paid in December.
The first supervisors&#39; union, the Federal Union of Prison Supervisors (Ufap/Unsa), &quot;calls for total mobilization (...) to show dissatisfaction and indignation&quot;.
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtimes increased a lot in 2009 and were not all included in the financial budget, but they assure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari had sent a message to the prison guards&#39; union assuring them that the payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts that prison staff are making to ensure the functioning and modernization of our prison system, the minister writes in her message.
I ordered the administrative directorate of prisons to take immediate measures so that the situation, which arose from the wrong evaluation of the number of overtimes, never happens again in the future, added Minister Alliot-Mariová.
The December salary will therefore be low, with the exception of managers, who receive the famous bonuses for performing the function and meeting the goals, according to Ufap/Unsa, and for them &quot;there is always a place in the budget&quot;.
It&#39;s simply a scandal, the interregional union FO in Marseille was outraged and announced its decision to boycott &quot;all meetings and summonses&quot; until further notice.
The workers will not come to work on Sundays or on holidays, if the bonuses for these days from the month of October are not reimbursed in December, as well as for overtime, the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne is also threatened.
At a time when they are giving us more and more work and more tasks without providing us with additional staff, it is sad to let the lowest-ranking staff pay for it, says the CGT-prison guards in Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better off than others.
However, in any case, the funds are not enough, stated the general secretary of Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
Obama says he gives &quot;better gifts&quot; at Christmas than the ones he gets
US President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, confided to the &quot;goddess&quot; of the screen, Oprah Winfrey, that when it comes to gifts, he has a simple rule: &quot;I give better gifts than the ones I get.&quot;
The president and his wife, Michelle, spoke on a special edition of the program, which will be broadcast on Sunday night on the ABC station, about how they are going to spend the Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, gets his share.
Santa also likes Bo, Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog will also &quot;of course&quot; get a present, according to excerpts from the show&#39;s pre-broadcast.
And Michelle Obama also objected to her husband&#39;s claim about the quality of the gifts he receives: &quot;Of course not, I gave you great gifts last year,&quot; she teased the president.
Well, that is of course true, the president was forced to agree, but immediately afterwards he humorously pointed his finger at the first lady&#39;s pearl necklace: &quot;And who gave you this?&quot;.
The Obamas also talked about their least favorite gifts they received as children in this one-hour, very relaxed show with the famous host who has been a staunch supporter of Barack Obama in his presidential campaign.
Barack Obama introduced a bicycle with a ten-speed gearbox, but also a basketball given to him for Christmas by his Kenyan father, whom he rarely met.
&quot;I remember seeing my father come to see us for Christmas and he gave me that basketball,&quot; the president said.
It wasn&#39;t until much later that I realized that he had actually given me the ball.
The first lady again remembered the dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize everything in the house, so I lined up all the furniture along the wall instead of placing it around the fireplace, but I loved the little dollhouse, Michelle Obama recalled.
Johnny Hallyday operated again, RTL reports that he is in artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was operated on again in Los Angeles due to &quot;injuries&quot; arising from a major operation he underwent in France, but the situation is &quot;under control&quot; according to those closest to him, while RTL said the singer is on artificial sleep to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker underwent another operation Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors diagnosed &quot;injury resulting from surgery&quot; on a herniated disc he suffered in Paris on Nov. 26, his press department said in Paris. stating that these lesions required &quot;corrective surgery&quot;.
However, the singer&#39;s press department tried to reassure the public and said that the situation was &quot;under control&quot; and at the same time announced that a new medical statement would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to the station RTL, which is the main partner of the singer&#39;s last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into artificial sleep to avoid &quot;pain and complications&quot;.
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we will have a little more certainty, adds RTL.
The press department did not confirm or comment on this information when asked by AFP.
RTL also reports that according to &quot;some sources&quot; no drain was placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker underwent surgery at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for a herniated disc.
The operation, which was planned several days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well known in artistic circles.
But the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on RTL&#39;s information.
Following this operation, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized on Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles due to an infection that occurred after the intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, told RTL radio on Thursday that his friend was going through a &quot;bad time&quot; but added that he was &quot;not worried&quot; about the rocker because he was a great &quot;fighter&quot;.
He called me right before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was being stupid because spending 12 hours on a plane after an operation like that is no fun, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer&#39;s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, calmed the situation, saying that Johnny Hallyday was &quot;responding well to antibiotics&quot; and that the infection had been &quot;stopped&quot;.
Mr Camus also said he had met Laeticia, the singer&#39;s wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concerns.
The singer&#39;s health problems have only multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone&#39;s surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday had been operated on for a &quot;small tumor of the small intestine&quot; and then a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long &quot;Tower 66&quot; tour, which is presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, his every health issue has been highly watched and commented upon. Fans and journalists noticed that the singer had difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team again had to deny the news of a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Bousquet&#39;s debut in his favorite discipline
France&#39;s Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Large Pool Championships, won the title at the 2009 European Small Pool Championships in Istanbul on Thursday in an event he is particularly fond of: the 50m freestyle.
Only three world records were broken on the first day of the championships, which is the last time overalls are allowed, although many more were expected.
One of them was overcome by the Hungarian competitor Evelyn Verrasztová in the 200 m medley race and the other two by the Russian men&#39;s relay team in the 4x50 m medley race.
Big upset for Bousquet, who was chasing the 50m freestyle world record he already holds in the big pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, in which ten swimmers started for the first time instead of the usual eight.
Bousquet beat Croatia&#39;s Duje Draganj (20.70) and Russia&#39;s Sergej Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30) as he had predicted.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try for it.
Like Bousquet, almost all the swimmers were wearing wetsuits made of polyurethane, which will be banned from January 1.
The kits have helped set 238 world records since February 2008, and their era ends in Istanbul, which first hosted them in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of a wetsuit this time did not help even Germany&#39;s Paul Biedermann, a two-time world champion in the large pool in the summer in Rome, who had a world record within reach.
The young swimmer failed to break the record he holds in the 400m freestyle (3:32.77) but still won with the second fastest time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russia&#39;s Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Denmark&#39;s Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn&#39;t give everything to that race.
I knew I wasn&#39;t going to break the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent going forward, Biedermann explained.
USA: a Romanesque sarcophagus slab belonging to Zolo was auctioned for US$1.5 million
A Romanesque sarcophagus slab that belonged to none other than French writer Emile Zola fetched US$1.5 million at auction on Thursday, well above its estimate, art dealer Sotheby&#39;s said.
The price of this two-meter-long and 63-cm-high faceplate, dating from the third century AD, was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble &quot;depicting four Dionysian scenes in elaborate architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and bacchantes is a rare piece, there are very few similar pieces in the world, perhaps four or five,&quot; Florent Heintz, Vice-President of the Ancient Roman and Egyptian Art auction at Sotheby&#39;s.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it is the item that was probably the most bid on, Sotheby&#39;s spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The fact that Emile Zola acquired this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The plate was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borgi family and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated the bathtub with it in her private hotel in Paris, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council before taking office to the power of Marshal Petain.
There she remained shadowed for about fifty years.
Florent Heintz discovered, searching the database of the Louvre museum, that this plate was part of the &quot;remains of Emile Zola&quot; opened from 1903, a year after the death of the author &quot;Therese Raquin&quot; and the fresco &quot;Rougon-Macquart&quot;.
Aborted attempt to have President Zelaya leave Honduras for Mexico.
Mexico on Thursday ruled that conditions were not met for the transfer of ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya, who the rebels refused to give a guarantee of safe departure.
After the phone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, everything for now indicates that there is no way to implement this transfer, said the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosová.
The Mexican government plane that flew to El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya flew back again, a source at the Directorate General for Migration said.
The coup government wanted to force President Zelaya to &quot;resign&quot; and to apply for political asylum abroad, only in this way would he be able to leave safely.
But the ousted president refused these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as head of state in exile.
The coup government &quot;experienced another setback when they wanted me to give up my post (...), they wanted me to resign,&quot; Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in which he often comments on the ongoing political crisis in the Central American country five months already.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, added the ousted president, hidden in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months, and played a few chords.
The Mexican embassy has asked us to provide a guarantee of safe passage, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not include an asylum request, the interior minister of the coup government, Oscar Raul Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not ask for asylum in any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Telesur station, which is based in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as the president of the Honduran people, he emphasized.
Rumors of Zelaya&#39;s departure mobilized supporters of the ousted president on Wednesday, who gathered around Brazil&#39;s embassy, where the military has beefed up security.
Brazil&#39;s foreign minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the coup government&#39;s stance.
They show their marginal attitude to international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who had grown close to socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, was ousted on June 28, the day he organized public consultations in preparation for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
He unexpectedly returned from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and found refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he gets out of there, he will be arrested and answer for the crime of &quot;high treason&quot; of which he is accused, according to the coup government.
Coup President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election to replace President Zelaya on November 29.
In the controversial election, recognized by the United States but condemned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against returning President Zelaya to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance prompts optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended Thursday with an increase, and the results of the American trade balance testify to the rise both in the United States and in its partners: Dow Jones gained 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to data from the final closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points and the Nasdaq, with technological dominance, from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard &amp; Poor 500 index improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial.
But we can&#39;t take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focused on the &quot;glass half full&quot;.
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly focused on the US trade balance numbers &quot;which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter&quot;.
The US trade deficit decreased by 7.6% in October compared to September, to 32.9 billion dollars.
Analysts, on the contrary, expected an increase in the deficit.
There was an increase in both imports and exports.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, particularly exports of goods, reflecting growth in the economies of the United States&#39; major trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week unemployment rose against all expectations and the number of jobseekers reached 474,000.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job applicants fell &quot;to the lowest this year,&quot; said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The stock market also fell.
The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday evening and the 30-year yield rose to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: hundreds of supporters of the regime booed &quot;Ladies in white&quot;
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime booed the wives of political prisoners who gathered in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day on Thursday, preventing another demonstration in which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About forty &quot;Ladies in white&quot;, wives or relatives of political prisoners, were booed directly in the street by supporters of Raul Castro&#39;s regime as they marched towards the center of the capital with a demand for the release of political prisoners, the journalist reported.
Down with the Yankees!, &quot;Mercenaries!&quot;, &quot;The streets belong to the revolutionaries!&quot;, &quot;Long live Fidel and Raul!&quot; supporters of the regime chanted at the dissidents with raised fists.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by plainclothes officers who came to &quot;ensure security&quot;.
A day before, there was a similar demonstration against the &quot;Ladies in White&quot; in Havana, but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in Havana&#39;s Vedado neighborhood, about ten dissidents were detained by plainclothes police who were also planning to demonstrate on Thursday to mark World Human Rights Day, an AFP journalist reported.
According to this journalist, the police forcibly loaded dissidents who were booed by supporters of the government regime into civilian vehicles.
Arresting dissidents in similar conditions usually takes only a few hours.
Winners of the European Parliament&#39;s 2005 Sakharov Prize, the Ladies in White organized an unauthorized march for &quot;the release of all, according to dissent, about 200 political prisoners,&quot; said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence .
Mr. Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be &quot;mercenaries&quot; or &quot;agents&quot; paid by their arch-enemy, the United States.
Miracle completed, Cuban television reported on Thursday&#39;s demonstration by supporters of the government regime against &quot;opponents of the revolution&quot;.
Cuba, with its Communist Party at the head and one-party government policy, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of not respecting human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A maniac killed an 80-year-old man and injured 5 people in Clichy-la-Garenne with a knife.
A madman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five others in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) during rush hour on Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary results of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker allegedly attacked with two knives and for unknown reasons an 80-year-old man in or in front of the pharmacy, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, this is the version of the police and witnesses.
The seriously injured old man, born in 1929, died in hospital from his injuries, according to the Alliance Police Syndicate.
The assailant then assaulted a pregnant woman and her partner in or in front of this pharmacy.
The husband, aged in his thirties, started to fight back and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where the 80-year-old man died.
The life of the second injured person is in danger, according to police sources, vital organs were apparently affected.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to hospital &quot;in shock,&quot; a police source said.
The armed man, who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled into the street, still on boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He injured two more people, apparently by accident: a man in his thirties and a man in his forties, the latter seriously.
How it all happened is not entirely clear, as it all took place in the evening hours.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he carried crosswise behind his back, the head of the Alliance syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé, said at the scene.
Several bystanders, including young people, tried to stop and disarm the madman, according to testimonies gathered by AFP.
I saw a guy in his thirties in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They couldn&#39;t do it because he was quite strong, Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar, commented on the situation.
The crowd rushed him, including one city policeman who broke his wrist in the process, he added.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the level of number 61, two city police officers, including their commander, tried to restrain the armed man and were wounded in the process, a police source said.
The incident took place on one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passers-by came to tell me that there was an injured person outside.
I went outside and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, I put him in a safe place and noticed a big wound on his stomach, Frederic Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person in his thirties arrived, who also had stab wounds.
The man, who did not have identification documents with him, was later arrested by the state police.
The public prosecutor in Nanterre referred the case to the investigation department of the regional police in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspected attacker was taken to hospital on Thursday night.
He is in custody and awaiting questioning.
A police source did not rule out his placement in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said six officers were needed to tackle him at Clichy police station, where he was taken.
He was &quot;quite beside himself&quot; like &quot;all lunatics of this type, whose power increases tenfold in action&quot;.
USA: Polanski&#39;s lawyer again requests the termination of the criminal prosecution
The lawyer of the Polish-French director Roman Polanski again requested on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States) to stop the criminal prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence due to a moral affair that happened thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, an attorney for the director of the movie &quot;The Pianist,&quot; criticized before three judges of the Second District Court of Appeal in California the serious errors that occurred in the retrial at the time of the events of 1977.
I demand that the prosecution be stopped now and now, said Hummel&#39;s lawyer, adding that the behavior of the judge who was ruling on the case at the time, Laurence Rittenbanda, &quot;had chills down his spine&quot;.
According to him, the judge (who has since died) was supposed to speak with the prosecutor before handing down the sentence, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison - a serious offense against the legal order.
Information about this conversation appeared in the documentary &quot;Roman Polanski: wanted and desired&quot; (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the mouth of the prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr Wells finally said in late September that he had &quot;lied&quot; to the document&#39;s author.
If the court refuses to stay the criminal proceedings, Hummel&#39;s attorney will request a trial where he can present evidence of his claims.
The prosecutor repeated what was already said at the first state, namely that there will be no serious study of the request to stop the prosecution until Roman Polanski appears in court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before a court handed down a verdict in the case of &quot;unlawful sexual intercourse&quot; with a 13-year-old underage girl.
Since then, he has never re-entered the United States.
Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayam said Roman Polanski &quot;should be there to attend the retrial.&quot;
Do we want to tell not only Roman Polaski, but also other defendants in this case that it is possible to escape? asks Mrs. Asayam.
He is of the opinion that the director &quot;asks the court for favors and at the same time despises its authority.&quot;
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to make a decision, also stressed &quot;that there are other alternatives to escape&quot;.
Lawyer Hummel was not alone in asking for the prosecution of Roman Polanski to be stopped.
The victim&#39;s attorney, Samantha Geimer, also again asked for the prosecution to be dropped.
She recalled that her client could no longer endure the perpetual harassment every time the Polanski case came up, adding: &quot;Nobody in this room can say the trial was fair.&quot;
Thirty-two years, that&#39;s enough&quot;.
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland at the behest of the US
After more than two months behind bars, he was released to house arrest at his cottage in Gstaad, where he awaits possible deportation.
Wall Street ends up without direction, held back by a rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, with the market torn between indicators that are better than expected in the US and the rising price of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to data from the final closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points and the Nasdaq, with technological dominance, left 0.55 points to end at 2,190.31 points.
The Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500 index increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Frankly, the market is very calm, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of trade has decreased a lot and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend was also confirmed by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which &quot;helped improve market sentiment regarding the stability of the economic recovery,&quot; analyst Charles Schwab summarized.
In the US, retail sales rose by 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and much more than expected.
US consumer confidence also rebounded, rising strongly to 73.4 in December from 67.4 in the previous month, according to a preliminary estimate of the index from the University of Michigan.
But the indexes were hampered by a fresh rise in the dollar against the euro, the highest in two months, which is &quot;pushing down sectors sensitive to the economic situation,&quot; said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Thus, technology stocks are losing ground.
The stock market fell.
The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday evening and the 30-year Treasury rose to 4.497% from 4.492% a day earlier.
Miss World election again in South Africa.
After traveling across South Africa for a month, 112 Miss World candidates are set to cross the finish line on Saturday to achieve their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
This big beauty pageant was held in the Johannesburg area for the second year and so far five candidates have made it to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were chosen as Miss Sport or Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real whirlwind of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I have seen a lot of things and have so many experiences!, Miss Sierra Leone confided.
The competition, now in its ninth year in South Africa, will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 5pm (3pm ET).
I could not have dreamed of a more beautiful country in which to wear the crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I am happy that I could experience it twice, Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova confided, in the hot southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in the Republic of South Africa was in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its &quot;breathtaking landscape&quot;.
After a month of performances, rehearsals, press meetings and safaris, Miss is now concentrating on the pageant itself.
India&#39;s Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who is also running, and Aishwarya Rai, the 1994 winner, who both went on to become Bollywood stars.
Being crowned the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman&#39;s dream, but it&#39;s not just about looks.
We are ambassadors for our countries and I want to go home with the crown, says Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th year will be in the spirit of music and dance.
The candidates will present themselves in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by Chinese TV presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World Committee Chairman Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with a warmth that is hard to match, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World pageant.
Just like last year, the candidates took part in a safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Unusual for a president, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Undoubtedly, the fondest memory will remain the draw in Cape Town (in the south-west of the country) for the World Cup in June 2010, which helped the country to promote the event a little more.
I could meet people I never dreamed of.
I will definitely come back to the World Cup 2010, says Miss Italy Alice Taticchi with enthusiasm.
According to son David, reports on Hallyday&#39;s condition are &quot;very positive&quot;.
The news about Johnny Hallyday&#39;s condition is &quot;very positive&quot;, as his son David assured us on his arrival at Los Angeles airport on Friday, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong and everything is going very well, declared David Hallyday as he got off the plane he arrived from Paris shortly after 1pm local time (9pm world time)
The singer&#39;s son, who seemed calm, said he would &quot;as soon as possible&quot; arrive at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johny Hallyday was admitted on Monday due to a post-operative infection arising from the operation of a herniated intervertebral disc, which he underwent on November 26 in Paris.
According to a press statement, the singer was &quot;put into artificial sleep&quot; in Los Angeles that night for comfort, to prevent pain and facilitate the administration of treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was already put into artificial sleep by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles. The hospitalization occurred due to an infection following an operation for a herniated intervertebral disc performed on November 26 in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this hit, the singer had to be operated again on the night from Wednesday to Thursday.
According to the AFP photographer, his wife Laeticia attended the school performance of the French Lyceum in Los Angeles on Friday morning, which their daughter Jade attends.
The head of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology at la Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would fly to Los Angeles on Monday to see the singer.
The producer strongly accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, M. Camus reported.
I have heard of the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday &quot;went too quickly to Los Angeles with the permission of his Parisian surgeon&quot;.
I personally spoke with the doctor on the phone and he assured me that this journey is not a problem, which surprised me greatly, as I myself have already suffered from a herniated disc twice, he added.
A while before, he said on the RTL radio station that the singer apparently flew away after the Paris operation without a drain, without anything&quot;.
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well known in art circles.
He operated on the actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic where he was working at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove a hematoma caused by bleeding in the brain.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, convicted several times in cases of medical negligence, tax evasion and fraud.
The lawyer of the medical chamber, Olivier Metzner, described him as &quot;a person without scruples&quot;, who is &quot;regularly&quot; summoned before the medical chamber, and who cannot even be &quot;recommended&quot;.
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux spoke on the matter through his lawyer David Koubbi on Friday.
He announced that the operation had &quot;completely gone well&quot; and the post-operative examinations were &quot;normal&quot;.
The operation was not of a hemorrhagic nature, therefore the insertion of a drain was not necessary&quot;, he added.
The singer&#39;s health problems have been increasing since this summer, and in any case, it seems that his next tour remains a question mark.
It is clear that the date for resuming the planned tour on January 8 (In Amiens, editor&#39;s note) seems too close, Camus said.
The UDF association is raising its voice and calling on the Nouveau Center party to stop using their acronym.
The UDF association, controlled by MoDem François Bayrou&#39;s party, responded on Friday to Nouveau Center president Hervé Morin&#39;s attempt to appropriate the acronym of Giscard&#39;s former party, saying it must not use the acronym in any media under threat of criminal prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to appropriate the UDF acronym, saying that François Bayrou does not deserve to carry its legacy after shaking hands with the left.
The Minister of Defense, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy before the National Council of the Nouveau Center (NC) movement on Saturday.
This move of his received the support of the deputy Hervé de Charette (former pro-UMP now pro-NC), who claims ownership of the UDF brand because he was the first to have it registered in 2004 with the National Institute of Industrial Property (l&#39;Institut national de la propriété industrielle ).
But on Friday night, a committee of the UDF Association run by friends of François Bayrou, who have no intention of being expropriated, broke their silence and made a formal request to both the minister and the MP to stop using the acronym and hand over ownership of the trademark, under threat of prosecution.
In recent days, you have raised alarming statements that you will propose to your political movement to +retake+ the acronym UDF, writes the Association in its letter signed by 19 of the 24 committee members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from the MoDem party and Senator Jean Arthuis from Alliance centriste.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement the name +Nouveau center+, with the slogan +UDF dneška+, the signatories of the letter also state.
As you know, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the UDF committee, which asks the NC movement to &quot;immediately remove all mentions of the UDF name from all promotional materials including (its) website&quot;.
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette &quot;to transfer the ownership of the trademark to the legitimate owners&quot;.
If you do not do so, we will approach the courts so that the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members are respected, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they state that the UDF &quot;has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978&quot; and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends &quot;chose to leave in 2007&quot; to create a rival movement, just as others did in 2002 to found the UMP.
According to them, the Nouveau center movement therefore has no right to use the abbreviation UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and to create a committee charged with defending the &quot;moral and material interests&quot; of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d&#39;Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues, &quot;when he registered the trademark&quot;, he was not &quot;a member of the UDF for three years&quot;, but of the UMP.
He scandalously and fraudulently used the non-existent registration of the acronym to do so on his own account.
This tactlessness is beginning to turn into a crime, they declare, before commenting with irony on NC&#39;s strategy: &quot;It seems to us that both in politics and in everyday life it is more valuable to make a name for oneself than to emerge from anonymity by fraudulent acceptance names to which we have no right&quot;.
The case of Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier will be tried for abusing a state of weakness.
The court in Nanterre decided on Friday to try the artist François-Marie Banier and give a verdict on whether he took advantage of the frailty of the 80-year-old billionaire to deprive her of part of her fortune, which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt accuses him of.
The photographer (age 62), known for his celebrity photos, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of a state of infirmity, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of 3 years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in what can be described as a family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which a mother and daughter are fighting each other and fighting for the management of the cosmetics empire L&#39;Oréal.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be carried out by a panel of three doctors.
The heiress and major shareholder of L&#39;Oréal has always refused to undergo such an examination, certainly not under the conditions offered by the prosecutor&#39;s office in Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors who will be elected on Friday should prepare a report by March 10, 2010 and at the same time give a statement on whether Liliana Bettencourt could have been in a state of weakness and for what period.
I think he will undergo it.
I will talk to her about the matter, Ms. Bettencourt&#39;s lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said after the hearing.
As for Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers&#39; lawyer, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the court&#39;s decision.
It is excellent news(...). Expertise will show that this old lady in need of protection was manipulated by (M. Banier), he confirmed.
It has been two years since Liliana Bettencourt&#39;s only daughter launched criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and jack-of-all-trades, whom she accuses of taking advantage of her mother&#39;s frailty for years to obtain a billion-euro gift in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or master paintings .
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-time friend.
While the court had to consider the validity of the lawsuit filed by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers&#39; court speech on Friday turned into a family truth hour at times.
Liliana Bettencourt&#39;s lawyer presented three letters that his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent to her notary, in which she expressed her distrust of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers&#39; husband.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the attorney, &quot;could you please explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
I have never been able to speak to Françoise since she got married&quot;.
The public prosecutor&#39;s office in Nanterre found again that the action of the complainant was not justified, all the more so because the guardianship judge recently rejected her request to start proceedings to issue legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt &quot;is fully capable of attending court, she is not under protection or guardianship.
No one else will act for her&quot;, confirmed the representative of the prosecutor&#39;s office, Marie-Christine Daubigneyová.
Ultimately, the court decided to rule on Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers&#39; eligibility at the time of the trial.
Managerial revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle to develop economic intelligence has been pointless…
For more than a decade, the behavior of management of large companies towards employees has resembled the approach of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about getting employees to identify with &quot;values&quot; determined from above, as it was before, when it was necessary to impose products that arose on the consumer from the ideas of the heads of factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of entrepreneurial companies, the marketing revolution has aligned market-conquering strategies in the right direction...although authoritarian efforts to impose products that differ from customer preferences regularly return!
A passive attitude of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon that mainly affects managerial staff.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and more importantly, economic intelligence.
And indeed, EI &quot;requires from all parties involved (...) an active approach and the ability to anticipate&quot; and demands from employees commitments that are completely at odds with the income of authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for a management revolution, which should aim to put workers at the center of interest of the company as well as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal polls.
Will internal opinion polls - such as a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees - contribute to a revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I&#39;m afraid not.
Mainly because I have already convinced myself that when faced with a new situation, the structure after various detours will preferably return to what it has always done!
Furthermore, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the severity of one&#39;s own failures.
And finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of engineering colleges, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
For the sake of intellectual convenience, they adopt the old behaviorist theory, currently revived by &quot;neuroscientists&quot; from the USA and widely disseminated without much knowledge by scientific institutes and the media.
With the fact that it is possible to move the &quot;levers&quot; (sic) of the involvement of managers, a recent survey by the Ipsos agency on the Figaro.fr website showed that it only confirms managers in their position of mechanical management, unsuitable for today&#39;s world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It consists in incorporating a basic insight into all management intentions and practices: For employees, commitments to the company will only be possible if they appear as a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of employee motivation is only dealt with by Motivational Functional Analysis studies.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of a predetermined doxa that allows them to evaluate, through the image that speaks of the business, what it offers them to realize their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, managers can control, predict and anticipate their &quot;social performance&quot; and put their human resource management &quot;on the right track&quot;.
This creates a fertile ground for the development of solid and effective economic intelligence.
The Oslo speech: &quot;just war&quot; earned Obama praise from the right.
The American right on Friday welcomed Barack Obama&#39;s speech in Oslo the day before, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner defended the concept of a &quot;just war&quot; against the United States&#39; enemies.
Conservatives who initially mocked Obama&#39;s Oct. 9 award this time applauded the president&#39;s speech, including Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin, the muse of the Republican right wing, told USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the &quot;sometimes necessary&quot; theme of war in her forthcoming memoir.
Of course, war is the last thing Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
All terrorists should be detained there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from his predecessor George W. Bush, justified the troop deployment in Oslo on Thursday, using a speech to explain his decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, assessed that the president did a &quot;very good job&quot; in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really very good, congratulated the former chairman of the House of Representatives, who especially appreciated the president&#39;s mention of &quot;the existence of evil in the world&quot;.
In a way, I considered this speech quite historic, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio show &quot;The Takeaway&quot;.
The former lawmaker, considered by some to be a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was excited to see a &quot;left-wing president&quot; remind members of the Nobel Prize committee &quot;that they themselves would not be free and could not present the peace prize if the use of force did not exist&quot;.
According to Michael Gerson, former George W. Bush speechwriter and now Washington Post editor, Obama gave &quot;a very American speech.&quot;
Not only did he present himself as a &quot;global citizen&quot; as always, but he &quot;spoke like an American president&quot; and reminded Europeans &quot;that they live in a safe bubble that they did not create and that they are not doing much to preserve it,&quot; Gerson assessed.
Among the few right-wing dissidents is Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, who called the speech &quot;monotonous, bloated and uninspired,&quot; according to the National Review Online website.
To the president&#39;s left, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich, for example, is horrified to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
&quot;When we wrap war in the mantle of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people,&quot; he warned.
However, the center-left press takes a favorable view of the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to consider the awarding of the Peace Prize to Obama premature, it assessed his performance as an &quot;overperformance&quot; even for a speaker known for his talent.
The speech from Oslo should serve as a guide to international decisions in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression&quot;, states the Californian newspaper enthusiastically.
Obama &quot;delivered a speech as needed&quot;, evaluated the New York Times, calling the speech &quot;simple and instructive&quot;.
Road hauliers: three marathons for deal to save Christmas supply.
After three marathon negotiations, road transport unions and the TLF, the only employers&#39; organization left to the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ended a call for strike action and the threat that hung over the delivery of Christmas supplies.
The Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, expressed his &quot;joy&quot; at the signing of the agreement on Friday, after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, negotiators broke up early Friday morning with the hope that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible by late morning.
And this despite the fact that three employers&#39; organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew from the negotiations.
But it took another more than six hours of the meeting, which started at 11 am, for everyone to agree and at 6 pm to sign the agreement.
The conflict &quot;would be very damaging to businesses&quot; and &quot;there would be a risk of disrupting the year-end holidays,&quot; Bussereau said.
The wording of the text includes a wage increase of 4% for the lowest salaries (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest salaries increases from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It&#39;s not much, but there&#39;s a lot of effort behind it, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight we will give orders to our members that there will be no blockades, no blockades of supply centers.
But there may still be a few naysayers who are not satisfied,&quot; he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed &quot;the right agreement&quot;, although it was difficult to admit the high salary increases given the international competition&quot;.
According to him, there will be an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement of common sense and respect for employees, declared CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the &quot;historic agreement&quot;.
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an &quot;acceptable compromise&quot;.
The agreement also envisages a 3% revaluation of travel expenses and a report on the state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow focusing on the issue of the 13th salary and the modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled the &quot;100 million euro reduction in corporate payroll taxes&quot; that was the subject of the government&#39;s amendment to the 2009 budget bill, which was voted on by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government will ask the Senate for a &quot;unanimous&quot; vote.
The signature allows that this agreement will apply first to companies that are members of this organization, and later to the entire field, in case of expansion by the Ministry of Labour.
It will take place &quot;as soon as possible&quot;, assured Bussereau.
Only the disapproval of employers&#39; organizations can slow down the whole process.
The FNTR organization talks about a &quot;bad deal&quot; because 100 million euros &quot;was already offered to the sector as part of the carbon tax compensation&quot;.
The Secretary of State for Transportation forced us into an emergency meeting not as a result of mutual analysis, but to avoid angering turkey eaters in the run-up to the Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
For the Otre organization, there is a risk that the agreement will &quot;bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises from the sector&quot; in the next 12 months.
RER A suburban trains: disruption of services at the weekend, unions unhappy with the proposals of the transport company RATP.
Service disruptions on the RER A commuter train line, France&#39;s largest urban public transport line, will continue into the weekend as talks between unions and RATP management on Friday failed to produce any concrete results on the bonus claim on the second day of the strike.
On Saturday and Sunday, the days of the important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will run only between 10am and 8pm, on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) every second train will run, outside this section only one train in four.
The connection with SNCF will be interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to transfer to another train.
The Galeries Lafayette department stores, which expect over 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that &quot;RATP tried to secure connections with large department stores&quot;.
The RER A line runs from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The RATP-managed section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one train out of two was running during peak hours, and virtually no trains ran during off-peak hours as planned.
As on Thursday, the residents of Ile de France arranged themselves differently and there was no confusion on the platforms.
So early in the morning there were far fewer people than usual at the Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station, partly because pupils and students were absent.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he got up &quot;an hour and a half early to make sure he would arrive on time&quot;.
The Saint-Lazare station was not overcrowded, state railway SNCF said, as a larger number of ushers and security guards had been expected.
RER A commuter trains operated by SNCF in the direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station with a metro connection.
Further general meetings of the strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday to assess the results of Friday afternoon&#39;s management meeting, which the union described as &quot;weak&quot;.
The RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER A suburban trains in all respects, adjustment of working hours, career progression, etc.
However, this is not the point for drivers who demand a well-deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon (Unions South).
The RATP has even shelved proposals on the bonus for the time being, angering the CGT, who said management &quot;was unable to resolve the issue while the tour operators and the SNCF were able to&quot;.
At the new meeting, which is scheduled for Monday, &quot;the conditions of the performance of the profession will be reviewed more closely&quot;, specified the transport companies RATP.
Which was the reason why the trade unionists think that the company is &quot;making fun of the weekend passengers&quot;.
In the morning, about 150 drivers occupied the works committee at its Paris headquarters.
The management, which until now had refused any discussion during the strike, therefore decided to hold a meeting in order to &quot;calm things down&quot;.
There is a danger that the conflict will spread to the RER B line on Tuesday, after Unsa and Nezavislí announce a strike alert.
The unions are asking for a bonus worth from 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants (Independent)) and complain about the deteriorating working conditions on this line, which daily transports a million passengers.
RER commuter train drivers earn between 2,200 and 2,700 euros in gross wages and 600 to 650 euros in bonuses for irregular working hours and for working on Sundays and holidays in the advanced stages of their careers.
The Turkish judiciary has disbanded for the Kurdish side, and this decision carries heavy consequences.
Turkey&#39;s Constitutional Court ruled on Friday to dissolve the country&#39;s main pro-Kurdish party. This decision immediately sparked protests and demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
The decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which is trying to extend a friendly hand to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become &quot;a nest of activities threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible unity,&quot; Supreme Court President Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority-seven vote needed to dissolve the party, Kiliç said, adding that 37 party cadres, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysela Tugluk, have been banned from political life for five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the cancellation of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluková and the confiscation of the party&#39;s assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP party has 21 seats (out of 500) in Parliament.
The party leadership warned even before the verdict that the MPs would rather leave the Parliament than work in it as MPs without a political affiliation.
The decision is a continuation of a trial started in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation, Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obeying the &quot;orders&quot; of the Kurdistan Workers&#39; Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is a legal political showcase for PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no &quot;core connection&quot; with the PKK, but refuses to label it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court&#39;s verdict comes as the government extends a friendly hand to the Kurdish community, offering a series of measures to strengthen their rights and attempt to curb Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
The DTP leadership confirmed that the party&#39;s dissolution could lead to renewed tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is being held have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the justice&#39;s decision was announced, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast that is populated mostly by Kurds.
Police used tear gas and water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or threw stones from slingshots.
About a hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said the justice&#39;s decision would only &quot;deepen the despair&quot;.
Turkey cannot solve this issue (of the Kurds, editor&#39;s note) by banning the party, he declared in the press.
The government, formed by a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We are against party interference as a matter of principle.
It doesn&#39;t solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
Political scientist Ahmet Insel commented that this decision is a complete blow to the democratic proposals launched by the government.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for one of the deadliest attacks in northern Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
Snow may come
Nicely crisp winter, that&#39;s what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the head of the FES winter technical services department.
But so that his employees could test and learn how to control all the vehicle technology.
According to meteorologists, this could happen for the first time this weekend.
Over 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of the snow and ice.
At the same time, FES is proceeding according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows all over Frankfurt and the temperatures drop below zero, they will go out on the 20 so-called A sections of the large spreader, explains Brauburger.
These sections include main and thoroughfares such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for the fire brigade, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and downhill sections such as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at three in the morning.
If necessary, something like 1,040 kilometers must be sprinkled with moist salt, which holds better, within a maximum of three hours.
That&#39;s why FES starts at three o&#39;clock in the morning &quot;so that the roads are clear when the traffic to work starts&quot;.
It&#39;s not easy when it only starts snowing at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter technical services department, &quot;because no one is willing to make room for the spreaders&quot;.
Only when it doesn&#39;t snow so much are the access roads and connecting roads, which also include the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Side and side roads have the last priority.
Brauburger knows there will be complaints.
At five o&#39;clock in the morning, FES infantrymen will set off, priority is being given to clearing dangerous places and crossings.
FES usually cannot take care of all cycle paths.
In Frankfurt, there is a special service that monitors especially bridges from 10 p.m. to 4:30 a.m., says Brauburger.
Since ice forms quickly on them, the spreader comes out immediately as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
The police will also call them if necessary.
Cradle of the Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The two-meter-long, 1.50-meter-tall animal ran on two powerful hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short forelimbs with sickle-shaped claws, and a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would not have been anything extraordinary.
But Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues write in Thursday&#39;s issue of the journal Science that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in present-day New Mexico, which was then located in the equatorial dry region of the supercontinent Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window on early dinosaur evolution, Nesbitt says.
It shows us a lot about the relationships, distribution and characteristics of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavations at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes we found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unheard of for Triassic deposits, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavations, they collected remains from a total of five individuals.
The discovery confirms theories about the early history of dinosaurs.
The name &quot;Tawa&quot; comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual find: &quot;Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are very rare, usually only single fragments are found.&quot;
Other dinosaur experts do not share this unqualified enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly sensational, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
According to current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared around 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are not complete, which is why the assignment of proto-dinosaurs is mostly questionable.
For example, experts debate when lizards split into three major evolutionary lineages: the carnivorous theropods, which later included Tyrannosaurus rex, Velociraptor, and birds, the &quot;long-necked&quot; four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the herbivorous Ornithischia (bird-eaters), which included for example the Triceratops and Stegosaurus species.
Tawa hallae is the original therapod, according to Nesbitt and colleagues&#39; analysis.
It exhibits an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air sacs, which are also found in birds, the descendants of theropods.
Thanks to air sacs, birds breathe more efficiently than mammals.
In Tawa hallae, even the bones of the spine were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air sacs, says Randall Irmis.
Since a related line of giant sauropods later also had air sacs and light bones, the common ancestor of both groups probably created this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Since the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, scientists deduced that lizards first appeared there.
According to this, the three lines of development split early and spread from South America to all the continents, which then formed a single land mass as the supercontinent Pangea.
The fact that the team found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods along with Tawa hallae would also speak for this.
The three cannot come from one common, immigrated ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
One even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to the group of the heaviest dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His assumption could paint a distorted picture, as South America has preserved very many primitive dinosaur fossils, while they are rarely found on other continents.
How the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile family to the ruling vertebrates on earth during the Earth&#39;s Middle Ages remains a mystery.
During the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today&#39;s crocodiles and flying lizards, and countless other lizards.
Around the end of the triassic, dinosaurs spread around the world and many new species evolved while relatives died out and the triassic-jurassic interface.
The success story didn&#39;t last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs happened to survive, but the reptiles didn&#39;t.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could push out the competition.
The success story didn&#39;t last forever anyway.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped another group of animals that also evolved in the Triassic and lived in the shadows ever since: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Docents from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen joined.
The police evacuation of the occupied casino of the Goethe University in Frankfurt caused a worldwide uproar.
278 professors and teachers of Goethe University, but also universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America stand in solidarity with the protesting students at the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they &quot;disapprove&quot; of the police intervention initiated by the Presidium.
Because the walls and artwork were scribbled, university president Werner Müller-Estler had the building, which had been occupied by striking students and lecturers for the past week, cleared.
In the process, five students were injured.
Damage to the cause, the signatories judge, does not justify &quot;the violent dissolution of the self-organized teaching of students and teachers by the police commando&quot;.
The clearance represents an &quot;unacceptable interference&quot; in the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to &quot;illegitimate and criminalize the protest&quot; and distract from the content.
The Presidium avoided the necessary discussion.
The lecturers call for a halt to criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most of the strikers did not support property damage.
Legitimate protest
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern about one&#39;s future, says the mysterious Earth Youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
The Hessian Science Minister Eva Kühne-Hörmannová (CDU) is currently defending the actions of the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said on Thursday in the Aktuellen Stunde (Current Hour) in the Wiesbaden State Assembly.
We understand the protest, but we have no understanding for the vandalism, said Peter Beuth, member of the regional assembly for the CDU.
The opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and the Link saw it differently.
The CDU is taking the painted walls as an excuse to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, there was an evacuation.
The line tabled a motion calling on the Home Secretary to report on the police deployment.
The new Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital city of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a heavily guarded location where secret weapons research was conducted.
Today, this district with 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the &quot;Russian Silicon Valley&quot;.
Important micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centers are located here.
Since September 2008, Zelenograd representatives have established contacts with the Riedberg Science Center in Frankfurt - with university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Zelenograd and Ridberg signed a &quot;Protocol on close cooperation&quot; in Frankfurt.
The Russian delegation was led by the multiple mayor of Moscow Yuriy Roslyak and Prefect of Zelenograd Anatoly Smirnov, and the senior planning officer Edwin Schwarz signed for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in natural science research will go to a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
It is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be enabled to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is home to important Russian research institutes and companies.
Among them are, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large Sitronics and Rossiiskaya Elektronika concerns.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called &quot;socialist planned city&quot; for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literally translated &quot;Green City&quot;) got its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research facilities are set.
Stuttgart brake
The Stuttgart 21 dimension cannot be adequately prepared at all.
For supporters of the project, it is quite simply the &quot;new heart of Europe&quot;.
Good. S21 is more than the launch of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction that will throw the capital of Baden-Württemberg into desperate construction chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 80s.
Head stations with tracks that ended in the city center were then considered to be transport-technical fossils of the 19th century, which act as brakes of modern rail traffic, because an enormous amount of time was needed to switch locomotives from back to front.
Drive, stop for a while, drive on - that&#39;s how it should work.
And that&#39;s why the main stations are disappearing: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station that lies roughly halfway along the route of the trans-European railway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan about &quot;the heart of Europe&quot;.
It really starts with S21, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious planners themselves recognized that the start of construction in the Hessian and Bavarian cities is almost unfinanceable.
Since there are modern shuttle trains with motor and control vehicles at both ends, main stations no longer have problems with entering and exiting.
Still: It starts with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE line to Ulm.
It was enforced by state and municipal politicians.
The railways work together, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the country are borne by the taxpayer and not by a state concern.
Urbanistically, the project can still be excused in some way.
A new urban space will be created, which - if we believe the computer images of the designers - will contain a lot of greenery.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the construction of the track are intended for passenger traffic, which - typically in the 1980s - was attributed to a tremendous increase.
Back then, there was no competition for cheap flights.
However, modern transport policy must first and foremost be about strengthening freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than truck transport on the road.
But the new line is not suitable for freight trains due to steep gradients.
More seriously, the S21 indirectly affects a lot of other railway projects.
A good six billion euros were to be buried in Swabia.
That&#39;s the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is clear that funding for additional nodes and bottlenecks in the network will be lacking in the next decade.
There are sixty larger projects on the Ministry of Transport&#39;s list.
One of the most important is the construction of a roughly 180 kilometer long route through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, construction has been slow on this route.
It would be necessary to push hard here.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The line through the Rhine valley will become the bottleneck of international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
The government is investigating the airport ruling
The state government left it open in the Wiesbaden state assembly whether it would go against the ruling of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) regarding the ban on night flights and have it revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition commissioned experts to legally assess the more than 400-page VGH judgment, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
The VGH in Kassel today justified in writing that the state would have to revise the night flight ban in the event of the construction of the planned northwest runway of Frankfurt Airport.
Permitting 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as assumed by the regional government, does not correspond to the legally mandated protection of the population from nighttime aircraft noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4 whether to request a review of the judgment.
The opposition criticized this delay and urged the government representative to waive the review by the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD faction leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to go back on the promises they made before the election to ban night flights. Otherwise, it can be evaluated as &quot;violation of the given word&quot;.
It&#39;s damn hard if you can keep your word, Greens chief Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the FDP&#39;s election slogan &quot;We keep our word&quot;.
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel&#39;s accusation that the state government is trying to get its night flights through &quot;distortion of the law and tricks&quot;.
Accurate legal review takes time.
The coalition does not want to work on the basis of a &quot;quick first impression&quot;.
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His faction&#39;s statements on the ban on night flights were never as presented by the opposition.
American banks repay the bailout
Big American banks, shaken by the crisis, are getting rid of state bonds.
Bank of America on Wednesday repaid aid from the bank rescue fund Tarp in a total amount of 45 billion dollars (around 30 billion euros).
According to a report from the American channel CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to repay state aid.
The institutes thus want to get rid of the restrictions that occurred by accepting money - the limitation of bonus payments to managers and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America has secured a good $19 billion in net cash from investors through convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the amount from her coffers, which was filled, among other things, thanks to union sales.
The head of the bank, Kenneth Lewis, gave an explicit thank you to the American taxpayer on Wednesday night: The cash injection helped us get through a difficult time.
The financial institution hurt itself at the height of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to free itself from its obligations to the state by raising money on the capital market.
CNBC, citing sources, reported that this American bank could already announce a capital increase of around $20 billion on Thursday.
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley already repaid the aid.
Quick choice
After all, it went faster than expected.
The station introduced a successor just two weeks after ZDF&#39;s board of directors pushed editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office.
Last night, the committee wanted to agree on that person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in the capital, Berlin, was identified as the favorite.
But the station did not confirm it - officially, so as not to preempt the process.
However, the fact that they did not want to harm ZDF director Markus Schächter if this proposal did not pass the board could also have played a role.
Frey, Schächter&#39;s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members.
The result of the vote was not known before the deadline of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the board of directors with his proposal to extend Nikolaus Brender&#39;s contract for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven were against him. Brender&#39;s loss of mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, although it was to be expected.
The Union majority in the administrative board already signaled a few weeks before the elections that it did not want to confirm Brender in the office.
Opposition to the editor-in-chief was organized by Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to continue in the office of the highly respected editor-in-chief, arguing that under Brender the viewing quotas for ZDF&#39;s newscasts had fallen.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which political influence on the ZDF was sharply criticized.
Last time, even 35 state law lawyers intervened in the debate, evaluating Koch&#39;s procedure as unconstitutional.
It was no use.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanistics.
He then worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, first to &quot;heute-journal&quot;.
Other positions: 1988 to 1990 personal assistant to the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 Correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of &quot;Morgenmagazins&quot;; until 2001, head of foreign policy at the ZDF; since then head of the ZDF main studio.
After Brender, who was voted Journalist of the Year by trade journal Medium Magazin on Wednesday, was ousted, the Greens announced they would file a constitutional lawsuit.
Koch&#39;s opponent in the board, Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the states should change the state contract with the ZDF so that the superintendent&#39;s personnel proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also rejected the exclusion of party politicians from ZDF supervisory boards.
Brender&#39;s supposed successor, Peter Frey, made a clever chess move to the board of directors - immediately after Brender&#39;s ouster, he strongly criticized the board for it.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter could nominate him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, and he could be elected by the board of directors without being suspected of being pushed into office by a partisan.
In party arithmetic, Frey is classified as a left-wing liberal anyway.
Studying gets rid of junk
Partial success for students: After a year of waiting, the ministers of culture finally went to the federal states on Thursday: At a conference of ministers of culture and university rectors, both sides agreed that there is a will to improve study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the burden of exams: In principle, each study module should end with a single exam.
In addition, the workload of students should be reviewed, and a &quot;realistic and defensible rate&quot; should be guaranteed.
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of exams between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Länder undertake to create a more flexible common structural assignment for bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s study fields.
Earth deviations should cease to exist.
Fewer exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in November, the ministers of culture and university rectors have had winged words in their mouths about better studies.
Now, for the first time, they are filled with concrete content.
The so-called accreditation council has decided that the number of exams will be drastically reduced: &quot;Each module will usually be completed with only one exam&quot;, it says in a 30-page report, which is partly intended to re-regulate the approval of study fields.
&quot;With a significantly lower exam load&quot;, said the chairman of the accreditation board, Reinhold Grimm, &quot;the erroneous development that significantly reduced the demands of the studies should be stopped.&quot;
In addition, the &quot;difficulty of study&quot; should be a &quot;decisive criterion&quot; in the implementation in the future.
Modules and contents &quot;must be carefully reviewed&quot; so that &quot;they do not unnecessarily limit students&#39; choice
seminars&quot;.
Students should be &quot;entitled to a space that enables and supports their own initiative&quot;.
The rules are to apply when approving new fields of study, but also for existing fields of study after review.
These need to be &quot;re-accredited&quot; every five years - which means, however, that it will take until 2015 before all fields of study are reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this throughout Germany, which are subject to the accreditation councils established by the federal states.
In October, the ministers of culture &quot;strongly&quot; urged the federal states to influence the agencies so that the content of the curriculum is not too large and the examination regime is not strict.
In the individual federal states, universities and colleges have already agreed with the state ministries on corresponding measures.
As the only country so far, Rhineland-Palatinate has pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna Process.
The money should primarily be used by universities to pay for consulting programs and study counseling, and to strengthen examination and immigration authorities.
The country and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to submit an amendment to the Higher Education Act to the parliament.
According to her, only one single exam should be needed to complete the study module.
The formation of the study should be even more flexible, for this the recognition of exams from other universities should be guaranteed and the access to the master&#39;s degree should be made easier.
By the end of next year, the demands of all fields of study in the country should be reviewed.
The government and the opposition argued again on Thursday about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the resolution.
The federal board of higher education groups Juso called for the creation of education policy not to take place &quot;behind closed doors&quot; of ministers and university rectors in the future.
At the latest after the strike, the students as affected persons should &quot;have at least a say in this&quot;.
Future academics also received support from the president of the Conference of University Rectors (HRK), Margreta Wintermantelová: &quot;We need the experience of students&quot;, she said on Thursday at a meeting with the ministers of culture, with whom the HRK consulted on a joint reform report.
According to the Education and Science Unions (GEW), the Bonn resolutions did not go far enough: They require a legal right that would allow any graduate with a bachelor&#39;s degree access to a postgraduate master&#39;s degree.
Second, the federal states must ensure that there are enough master&#39;s degree places with the best possible study conditions for today&#39;s generation of bachelor students tomorrow, said GEW board member Andreas Keller.
The Länder must employ far more lecturers.
However, the ministers of culture did not comment on free access to master&#39;s programs.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
To get to Germany and out is nice, almost no control...&quot; reads the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, who in this fragmented piece of language thematizes the arrival experience of a dissident who gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania. He first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer at a children&#39;s book publishing house. In 1982, he moved to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner has been honored with various literary prizes, in 1993 he lectured on poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He caused a considerable non-literary uproar last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, which was about &quot;German literature in Romania in the mirror and broken mirror of its security files&quot;.
An obviously flustered and stunned Söllner left a statement in which, in front of fellow Romanian-German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, he confessed to his cooperation as a secret informant for the Romanian Securitate.
Together with some of those present, Söllner won the German Language Prize in 1989.
Attempts to recruit are said to have begun inconspicuously, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner continued, &quot;that is, someone who did not sufficiently resist the Securitate&#39;s attempts at intimidation.&quot;
The poet Werner Söllner is the secret agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the awarding of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary confrontation with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors originating from Romania, is shaken by a case that indicates the depths and infamy of a political system based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner is not, at least according to the current state of knowledge, only a perpetrator, but also a victim.
In the Securitate files, secret agent Walter played some role, Michael Markel said after Söllner&#39;s confession, referring to secret agent Walter&#39;s positive influence on himself.
He &quot;cut me off&quot; at that time in all important points for him, says Markel.
He has a moral obligation to make this remark.
Söllner&#39;s statement was unexpected in this form and in front of this audience, but the confession of the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not completely surprising.
Herta Müller already wrote in July when she was reading her own files, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the spies of the Securitate.
Those affected, it can be assumed, will speculate and in some cases even probably know which name is hidden behind the code name Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Unlike the domestic, by now very certain inspection of the Stasi files, the manipulation of the remnants of Securitate control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic education has been thwarted and limited.
One of Birthler&#39;s offices, which corresponds to the National Council for the Processing of Securitate Files (CNSAS), was founded only in 1999, and the release of files has been rather lengthy since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law that governs the management of folders.
That the former members of the Securitate still have great influence in Romania was evidenced by an interview after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which one of the former heads of the Securitate from Timișoara made a dismissive statement about the winner of the award.
She is said to be psychotic, after all she was only interrogated once.
The denigration of power was expressed here quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, the Söllner case, as with concealed wrongdoing, has inevitable questions.
Why now? Who was harmed? The audience&#39;s peculiar reaction to Söllner&#39;s confession leads us to expect that the continuation of this chapter will be determined more by the desire for knowledge than by the admission of guilt and shame.
This is more than a footnote to the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who accepted the Nobel Prize yesterday.
Saturated Champions League deposit
It looked like a cleanly dressed sales representative had arrived from a cute Christmas party where the sporting goods manufacturer was handing out sweets when the new VfBr coach Christian Gross got into a summoned Mercedes C-Class at a quarter past midnight, accompanied by an orange-colored sponsor&#39;s bag. ¨
A man with a striking bald head let himself be driven around a still foreign city for him.
Otherwise, he could drive himself - alcohol was not involved, and the 55-year-old man was not drunk on happiness either.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work will continue.
Or it&#39;s just starting.
In the words of the Swiss, who has only been engaged for three days: &quot;Although we have reached the round of 16&quot;, namely in the Champions League thanks to a 3:1 win over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, &quot;but we must not be dazzled by success: It will be a brutally tough fight against relegation.&quot;
A &quot;far more important task&quot; lies ahead on Sunday.
It is important to repeat in Mainz the performance from the royal class even on an ordinary league day.
And to avoid obvious weaknesses again after three quick goals by Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Lottery
The Champions League Round of 16 (matches 16/17 + 23/24 February/ return matches 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of the explosive arrival of Babbel&#39;s successor will therefore remain.
Not only with the supposed healer, who in a short time gave uncertain Stuttgart professionals confidence, willingness to commit and joy of the game.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and encouraged them to be more courageous, soul healer Gross explained such a simple-sounding success recipe, but under the influence of therapist Babbel, it no longer showed any effectiveness.
He stirred up a certain magic, admitted Babbel follower Jens Lehmann, &quot;when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn&#39;t have thought possible.&quot;
And Sami Khedira, who after a many-week layoff caused by injury, thanks to his dynamism, immediately became the best player on the field, tried to describe the identified &quot;phenomenon&quot; with the proverbial &quot;fresh wind&quot; and the working procedures of the new superior: &quot;He is a man who is radical and demands discipline .
That&#39;s what we need in the current situation.&quot;
It was clearly missing under Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, sports chairman Horst Heldt warns
But VfB Stuttgart needs more consistency.
Like Gross, the players and managers do not want to overestimate the victory against the weakened substitute and completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would have won in Glasgow too, before the rude awakening came after the 0-4 defeat in Leverkusen, Khedira thinks.
And sports chairman Horst Heldt reminded that although one goal was achieved in the season, the second one is still far away.
We&#39;re not out of the water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first home win in three months was due to the weekend&#39;s events, brought to life fresh in the form of a televised interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before kick-off.
There are decisions made by others and not by Jens, Heldt responded to Lehmann&#39;s harsh criticism.
He presented the board with weak management and it was decided to change the coach after the pressure of adolescent fans.
Even the fact that his day off after the matches was canceled was described by Lehmann as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann&#39;s statements &quot;formulate pure egoism&quot;, replied Heldt and announced the consequences for the goalkeeper.
Both forty-year-olds will probably no longer have any joy in life.
In any case, they agree with the others that without the work of the deposed coaching team, such a strong and combative performance by the players would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had &quot;a big part in the success&quot;, Heldt and Lehmann say in unison - and the man with the plastic bag agrees.
World Heavyweight Championship Fight
Passionate duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
However, after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his WBC heavyweight title.
The verdict of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains the heavyweight boxing champion of the world.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated the American Kevin Johnson on unanimous points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) on Saturday night in Bern.
This is Klitschko&#39;s third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Before that, the Ukrainian was twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC organizations.
Unfortunately, it didn&#39;t turn out as everyone expected.
Klitschko improved his record to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice he was defeated due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson was defeated for the first time in the 24th fight.
In front of roughly 17,000 spectators in the Bern arena, the 2.02-meter-tall Klitschko controlled the fight mainly with his left hand.
The eleven-centimeter smaller Johnson, who announced the end of Klitschko&#39;s era before the duel, retreated from the world champion&#39;s blows, so Klitschko could not land a decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
All in all, the passive Johnson did very little on the challenger and just tried to get to the next rounds.
Although Klitschko provoked with words and gestures, his punches rarely hit the world champion.
But even so, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought with Klitschko for a full twelve rounds.
The challenger caused a stir in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko as a &quot;disgusting zombie&quot; who &quot;doesn&#39;t do anything properly&quot;.
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champion allowed himself to be provoked, pulling Johnson&#39;s sunglasses off his nose &quot;so he could see his eyes&quot;.
Fourth victory after Klitschko&#39;s return
Klitschko remained undefeated even after the fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008.
After an almost four-year break, he defeated the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back &quot;his&quot; WBC belt, which he had previously had to surrender without a fight.
He defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba in the title defenses this year and Chris Arreola of the USA in September.
In this fight, I received only one blow and I am physically in good shape, Klitschko justified his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to defend all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimír is the WBO and IBF world champion.
But the WBA belt is worn by the British David Haye, after he dethroned the 2.13-meter-tall Nikolai Vulaev in November.
In the summer, Haye canceled the fight against Klitschko, which was scheduled for September.
His promotion company is reportedly planning a fight against Klitschko at London&#39;s Wembley Stadium.
The case of Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: The head of the Green faction, Jürgen Trittin, called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar because of bad information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and Linke (Left) call on the chancellor to provide an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings regarding the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) committed deliberate deception.
The minister said a &quot;knowingly untruth&quot; about the deadly bombing of two tankers in September, Green faction leader Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday&#39;s ARD news program &quot;Tagesschau&quot;.
Let&#39;s call it the usual term: Lied.
The order to kill was issued in defiance of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That&#39;s the gist of the report that NATO had that Mr. Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it became clear that the attack was not just about destroying the hijacked trucks, but about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
According to a NATO investigation, up to 142 people were killed or injured in the American airstrike requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein.
The Greens, SPD and Linke called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Mrs Merkel must explain whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of the Bundestag&#39;s Afghanistan policy - and whether the Chancellor&#39;s Office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, urged Jürgen Trittin and Greens colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm flatly rejected the criticism.
The chancellor&#39;s office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
Doubts were also voiced on Saturday about the department&#39;s account of the background to the firing of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both informed Guttenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the tankers.
Officially, it was said that they should have denied the existence of the NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
However, it was heard from those around the two top officials that they had even alerted the Ministry of Defense to several reports, among them a two-page document by commanding Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung&quot; reports that Wichert had meanwhile asked in a letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that he has not yet received any response.
The ministry did not comment on the accusations on Saturday and pointed out that this will be addressed in the investigative committee of the Bundestag, which will be established next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images and hear voices while awake that others cannot see or hear.
The boundaries between imagination and reality merge not only with the mentally ill or those under the influence of drugs.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we may surround ourselves with the wildest imaginations and fanciful mirages.
However, anyone who experiences dream states while awake, sees and hears things that others cannot see or hear, is considered in today&#39;s Western world to be a fool or a drug addict, or at least a freak.
However, such images and voices do not only occur in the mentally ill or in drug addiction.
Our imaginations are to blame: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures, or write novels occasionally blur the lines between dream, imagination, and reality.
Dreams, an altered state of consciousness, can occur in various forms, at best we call them visions, at worst delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New-Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the shamanic states of delirium, psychosis, and hallucinations can all be traced to similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions occur when the balance of the brain&#39;s neuronal transmitters - primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - is disrupted and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusions occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him
The connection between delusion and dream has preoccupied philosophers and physicians since antiquity.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dreaming in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, noted in 1861 &quot;the great similarity of delirium to dream states&quot;, for Sigmund Freud the dream was even &quot;psychosis, with all the nonsense, illusions, deception of the senses&quot; .
It&#39;s autumn 2001, Henning T. turns into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and garishly colored.
Gravity has no power over him, he floats near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devilish figures with blood-red grimaces, baring teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, fiery boots, throw him against the wall, feel the pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices threaten from the walls and from the radio.
He can no longer bear the voices that curse and insult him.
Henning T. rips two cables from the stereo, knots them into a loop and fastens it to a hook on the ceiling.
He steps onto one speaker and puts the noose around his neck.
He jumps.
The loop allows.
Learn a lesson, shout the chorus of voices tearing his eardrums, &quot;go to the clinic and get treated!&quot;
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
They were started on LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, in addition he is manic-depressive, takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and the deepest doubts, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality
About one percent of people will fall ill with schizophrenia at least once in their lifetime, it is the second most frequently treated illness in psychiatric clinics after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, sufferers can no longer distinguish between the inner and outer world, they get into an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of size, relational illusions or the illusion of persecution.
Hearing voices is especially widespread - voices that give orders, comment or lead dialogues.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The disabled person is unable to distinguish important from unimportant, the brain cannot filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream, psychosis opens the floodgates to a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Department of General Psychiatry at the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the action, everything has meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he falls into a passive role, becoming, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and unable to actively shape them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is mostly not possible for them, ghosts are a terrible reality, awakening is impossible.
A once-in-a-lifetime hallucination
Unlike in a dream, says Fuchss, &quot;the sensory and spatial structure of reality that a person perceives in psychosis remains fundamentally preserved.&quot;
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, alienation of experience occurs within a real framework.
Scientists are still faced with the puzzle of why exactly our brain makes such projections.
Extraordinary states can cause anyone to lose touch with reality for a short period of time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone develops psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists assume that affected individuals have minimal brain damage.
We believe that there is damage to the brain&#39;s neuronal maturation early in development, for example by a viral illness in the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
However, it remains a mystery how the neuronal system malfunction occurs, which did not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis, if there is a disposition for it.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain boils
The crazy thing is that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them they swallow expensive medications, others give money for drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten from Lübeck.
Whether we perceive hallucinations as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and delusions for ten years, and last year he interpreted his results in the book &quot;Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf&quot; (The Unreal World in Our Head).
Hallucinations belong to the typical accompanying phenomena of psychoses, but also to surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to psychological disorders such as borderline personality or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer&#39;s or brain trauma are also often present.
Surprisingly, even the brain of a healthy person hallucinates under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of thought contents that are normally repressed.
They occur when the parts of the brain that process sensory perception are overactive or under-repressed; if our brain freezes or if there is a lack of stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as can brain damage or psychosis.
But also withdrawal of stimuli, stress, worries about love or other exceptional conditions.
In more recent studies, up to a third of those questioned stated that they had experienced a hallucination at least once in their life.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and goes to the local grammar school.
A completely normal girl actually.
If there weren&#39;t those pictures and voices.
During breaks, she might be approached by a tall man with long, dark hair.
When she answers him, her classmates look at her with surprise - no one but her can see or hear this boy.
This shy girl is considered a tight-lipped dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn&#39;t dream, she knows that.
He is awake, hearing and seeing the boy, just as he hears and sees the girl sitting next to him in the pew.
She can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It&#39;s a nice feeling, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, he sometimes asks.
But he knows that this boy and other illusions are not real and he disappears again.
At night, the apparitions are rather daunting
Delusions are often a burden.
As she sits in the classroom, she can&#39;t watch the lesson many times because the teacher in her eyes and ears is introducing a new classmate, while he is explaining mathematical equations to everyone else audibly and visibly on the blackboard.
At night, the apparitions are rather daunting.
As she waits in her dark room for sleep, which comes rarely and too late, she often can&#39;t tell if she&#39;s awake or asleep, if the images she sees, the grimaces, or the girl with bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, arise in front of her open eyes. or with closed eyes.
Leave me alone, he yells at the characters.
She doesn&#39;t tell her parents and friends about it, they would think she&#39;s crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she contacted psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows for sure that she is not crazy.
Illusions are also the art of desperation
If someone is socially isolated or deprived of stimuli, they are more likely to hallucinate, Kasten says.
I believe that the brain then does not have enough work and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she had been calling her dad since she could think on her own was not her own father.
Because the same brain regions that process real sensations and sounds are active in visual and acoustic hallucinations, it is difficult for sufferers like Sarah K. to distinguish between delusions and reality. &quot;Every experience&quot;, says Kasten, &quot;takes place in the brain, reality is also displayed there.
Hallucinations are also images created by the brain, which is why they seem so real.&quot;
Kasten also evaluates night dreams as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Compared to schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
A borderline state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our world focused too much on consciousness, the imaginary experience is mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Psychiatry and Psychotherapy Clinic of the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a difficult, painful disease, but it also brings positives, creativity - mirage is also art from despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard investigated the so-called oneiroid form of experiences, a special form of altered consciousness similar to a dream.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams that the sufferer believes to be real and cannot even retrospectively distinguish them from the waking state.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, for example patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience motor paralysis while fully conscious.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, for example by a permanent, complete inability to move, he replaces life-threatening real situations with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of borderline state between dream and hallucination.
Because in reality it is not possible to manage a situation, the worlds will change, but the real situation will be present in the imagination.
An intense form of sense support and sense transfer in some excruciating situation that allows us humans with our own shaping ability to go into unconsciousness in an instant.
Everything is real, even later in memories
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book &quot;Herzwechsel&quot; (Exchange of Heart) as a soul-saving action.
He was 49 years old when, following heart valve surgery followed by a heart transplant, his consciousness took a journey of several days, his body lying motionless in the intensive care unit.
Claussen immersed himself in the world he created, visited strange times and places: He becomes an old man confined to a bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobility who make intoxicants from blood.
He is kidnapped by a Greek on a motorbike to his homeland, while in a hospital bed he surfs a firn in the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
He immerses himself completely in the imaginary plot, everything is real, even later in his memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
A dream is another state, it describes one&#39;s experience.
In contrast to dreams, memories from those mental journeys are still distinctly clear years later and in unimportant details.
Even clearer and more intense than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience shatters the horizon of our other real experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, oneiroid states, psychoses, hallucinations and drug intoxication show how fragile our internal images of external reality are even in the waking state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten, &quot;can lead to a distortion of what we call reality.&quot;
A fact that can also be rewarding.
Snow may come
Burda
At 27, the children are to take over the publishing house
The new head of the Kallen publishing house is a temporary solution: In the long term, Hubert Burda wants to pass his business into the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding company will continue to belong 100 percent to the family in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and have a firm will to enter the business, the 69-year-old man tells SPIEGEL.
We worked out the details carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is only asked afterwards.
Even the question of whether they have the skills to do so.
It is not possible to put your children in charge of 7,500 employees if they are not capable enough.
That would kill both the kids and the business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he was stepping down as chairman of the board as of January and named Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the board of directors at Burda since 1999.
First he was in charge of technology.
Later, with the Treasury department, responsibility for the company&#39;s assets was added, and after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer, also Direct Marketing, Foreign Affairs, Printing and Finance.
For the first time, none of the family members is at the head of the publishing house.
Burd&#39;s children are 19 and 17, his son Felix, who would have been 42 today, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to &quot;bridge 10, 15 years&quot;, Burda said.
The holding company should also belong 100 percent to the family in the future, says Burda.
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda commented that even family businesses are not safe from extinction: &quot;It has always affected companies that were infected by the desire for capital, that speculated and thought they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had &quot;dreams of world power&quot;, claims Burda.
I don&#39;t see myself as the political preceptor of this country like Springer was, and I don&#39;t want to play world league with &quot;Time,&quot; these deals are too big.
Comprehensive beauty care
Everything you could wish for in terms of beauty and well-being is at your fingertips.
This is what El Corte Inglés has set out to do, which has just opened the Callao (Madrid) shopping center with an area of more than 1,000 m2, where various services in the field of body care are provided.
The wellness department is located on the eighth floor, where such prestigious companies as Hedonai dealing with laser hair removal are located; Spaxion, spaces for relaxation and aesthetic procedures; Luis &amp; Tachi hairdressers; Marina d&#39;Or with a gym or L&#39;Occitane offering natural cosmetics, and more.
There is also a department for nutrition and mainly a tea room offering more than 130 different types of tea.
You can also enjoy relaxing massages with your partner while enjoying the view of the capital, you can rent a relaxation zone for two hours and arrange your own &#39;beauty party&#39; in the company of up to eight friends, relax in the jacuzzi, have a massage and a glass of champagne, which are some of the variants of Spaxion.
It is a total of 250 m2 in the form of 12 salons, in which the above services are provided, as well as the most modern facial and body care procedures, as well as hydrotherapy.
As an example, we can mention cavitation, which is used in the fight against cellulite, or vibrating platforms.
The gym is also equipped with these machines, in addition to virtual trainers who monitor the individual actions of the clients and thus provide completely individual care.
It all starts by inserting the personal key into the contact display, which is located against the machine.
You can then watch video demonstrations that will demonstrate the correct execution of our exercise set.
Your instructor guarantees that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) is enough to work all the muscles.
And if after exercise we feel like going to the hairdresser, the Luis &amp; Tachi company has a space where individual procedures are carried out to heal the hair, improve its shine and nutrition.
Innovation and exceptionality are the motto of this urban wellness center, which is open every day from 10.00. until 10 p.m.
Escotes varios
Christmas is coming and that&#39;s the time to find out what celebrities are wearing and adapt your festive wardrobe accordingly.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the figure, which must be noted.
Here are some suggestions.

Endesa and Barcelona, with an electric car
Energy company Endesa together with Barcelona City Hall founded the &#39;Live Office&#39;.
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE&#39; office (Logistics for the introduction of electric cars) will establish and manage the travel plan for the introduction of electric cars in the city and secure mobility agreements, handle, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric cars, collect opinions and results of activities in the involved sectors.
All in all, the purpose is to support this means of transport of the future.
3 &#39;electric cities&#39;
However, Barcelona is not the only city to join the project of introducing electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will also join the project.
These are three cities chosen by the government as part of the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
Energy company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The purpose is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan Autonomous Region.
This also includes activities related to energy and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative with the participation of Endesa, as far as the promotion of electric cars is concerned.
The company is represented in European standardization teams and actively implements a number of additional projects, e.g. G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero foresees a &#39;quiet period&#39; for the car industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that Spain&#39;s automotive industry, the country&#39;s main export sector, is in for a &quot;quiet period&quot;.
In the economic report of the Prime Minister for 2009, Zapatero summarized the measures that were introduced during the year to support the automotive sector.
&quot;Without the Competitive Plan for the automotive industry, today we would be in a state of abandonment, the closure of some of our main production enterprises&quot;, stated the Prime Minister.
&quot;Thanks to this plan and the desire of the individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of calm is expected in the future for this industry, which is our main export sector&quot;, he added.
In this sense, he pointed out that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Integral Plan of the Automotive Industry (PIA), designated 800 million for the projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment exceeding 3 billion Euros.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernization of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also highlighted government measures to support the demand and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is implemented in cooperation with autonomous regions and car brands.
According to the president, this plan made it possible to reduce by 6% the average level of emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and ensured a &quot;significant increase&quot; in registrations, specifically by &quot;40 percent&quot; in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first International Salon of Classic Vehicles will open in Madrid, which is a meeting place for professionals and amateurs from the world of motors.
This initiative will take place on February 5-7, 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of Madrid&#39;s Casa de Campo.
It is an exhibition area with an area of 20,000 square meters, where more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will not only find classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid there will also be products of all kinds related to the world of motors.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real treats for collectors and the curious.
Among the participating companies will be the following: Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restoration; or Cochera Clásicos, a specialized Mercedes Benz company.
Outdoor aptitude tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: the holding of training sessions, sports performances, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
There will also be aptitude tests for classic cars and motorcycles in a customized circuit outside the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-Stop: maintaining a sporty style
Mazda intends to show that environmental friendliness has no negative effect on sporty style.
And that&#39;s why the Mazda3 has a built-in engine stop and start system - also christened jakoi-Stop-, a device that is currently only available with the 2.0 150 hp petrol engine.
This second generationMazda3 is characterized by good characteristics that it has achieved as a whole.
Finish, vehicle design, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent in the Mazda3.
Front seats incl. the driver&#39;s seats have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely soft.
Using the instrument cluster and console, we conclude that Mazda continues the Japanese trend of developing a futuristic design with many buttons and controls and bold red and blue colors.
This style partly reminds us of the style that also presents the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and specifically even more so with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product presents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, the large luggage compartment and regular shapes should be mentioned.
So far, the automatic engine stop and start system is available only with the two-liter gasoline engine and 150 horsepower six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real treat. It is very gentle, characterized by a reduced noise level, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most desirable Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not drive so many kilometers per year should not rule out this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, as it is characterized by greater driving comfort and reduced consumption.
In terms of equipment, the version chosen for testing is called Sportive and includes more standard features.
Among the standard equipment, it is necessary to mention in particular the lane monitoring system (RVM), which prevents the formation of a blind spot, traction and stability control, speed control, light-sensitive interior mirror, on-board computer with a large screen, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain sensor and lights, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
And if the equipment was not enough, this version was equipped with Pack Premium, for an additional 1,500 euros: adaptive bi-xenon lights and BOSE sound system with CD holder, among other components.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its category.
It is characterized above all by the quality of the materials used, its operation and high level of equipment.
And in addition, people who do not drive a large number of kilometers per year can choose this i-Stop version, which is only with a 2.0 gasoline engine and 150 hp.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which amounts to 21,770 euros for the Luxury version and 23,270 euros for the tested version -Sportive-.
For this high price, the Mazda3 offers us a lot of satisfaction for every day.

The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, only used to view mail, without the ability to view certain types of attachments or surf the web.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame in the US when Time magazine named it one of the products of the year.
It&#39;s harder to see it outside, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek features a very low price and monthly payments, less than half of what you pay for an iPhone data plan, for example.
After its success, the company started offering two new devices: one exclusively for Twitter, the other based on a free data service that is always provided, but for which you need to pay six times the amount of Peek.
FonPeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and at the same time its third transformation.
It is limited just like its American counterpart, but it brings surprises.
The monthly price for maintenance is about 12 euros per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People traveling with a smartphone already know what it means to lose data service after crossing borders, or impatiently look for a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection) so they can check their mail.
The fixed price rooming idea is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience you&#39;d need a PhD in physics to understand them, as well as very good glasses to read the fine print.
The European Commission is constantly demanding to reduce roaming tariffs so that they are accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is a reasonable concern about using data services outside the home state.
That a device like the FonPeek (interestingly it still has the name Fon when it doesn&#39;t have WiFi) achieves this type of tariff means that operators are starting to think differently and consider different offers to compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, it offers book downloads and other internet searches.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and you pay when you buy it, not by months.
And that&#39;s exactly what I expect to happen with FonPeek one day, it&#39;s a purchase option with permanent access like what Peek already has in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I&#39;m checking my mail on my phone, thank you.
I expect it because I think it is the best type from a consumer point of view.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on a computer.
A color that Michelle adores
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the US First Lady.
She chose a dress and coat in this color for Barack Obama&#39;s inauguration as President of the United States, the same color she also chose when she accompanied him to the second most important moment of his life: the presentation of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: apart from the fact that it is a similar color - yellow-green with glittering effects - in both cases it was a three-piece set - a dress, a bag and a coat in the same fabric - decorated with a large embroidery or a collar .
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the USA decided to follow in the footsteps of the Asturian princess and wear a similar outfit.
The fabric from which the clothes are made makes the two models quite different.
On the occasion of taking office, Michelle used a large lace, in Oslo velvet with a print.
They also change the accessories: green shoes with a medium high heel, a similar model now, but in gold color.
She also wears different hairstyles: this time in a bun, previously loose hair.
75% of working mothers have work-related problems related to motherhood.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who intend to have a child.
This is the result of the study &#39;Fertility and the working career of Spanish women&#39;, carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Women&#39;s Institute.
9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 took part in the study and the results are unequivocal: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities on the labor market due to motherhood.
The study emphasizes that at the beginning of cohabitation, there are many differences in opinions about the number of children, depending on whether they work or not, and also according to the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job start living with a partner earlier, give birth to their first child earlier and have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable jobs, especially in the public sector, delay cohabitation and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
&quot;Women aged 35 to 49 with a stable job have their first child on average 3.7 years after cohabitation with a partner. This figure is 4.1 in the case of women who devoted a larger part of their lives to achieving their stable job and therefore had to postpone cohabitation and the arrival of children.
The type of occupation also has a strong effect on motherhood, although it has a smaller effect on the start of cohabitation with a partner&quot;, explains Margarita Delgado, who is engaged in research at CSIC.
Another factor influencing the age of women at the time of marriage and the birth of a child is the level of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which women get married and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group of 35 to 49 years, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child at the age of 25.1 or 32.1.
&quot;There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with primary education get married and give birth to their first child even before finding a stable job, while women with secondary or higher education go the opposite way, preferring to get a stable job, before getting married and having their first child&quot;, says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L&#39;Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of models: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal slogan &#39;Because I&#39;m worth it&#39;.
The representative of &#39;Joyeux Noël&#39;, one of the most elegant actresses of the international level, thus joins other famous personalities of L&#39;Oréal Paris such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Even before her, actresses Evangeline Lilly (&#39;Lost&#39;) and Freida Pinto (&#39;Shack Millionaire&#39;) joined this select club.
The men&#39;s part of this cosmetics brand is also represented by important personalities: Patrick Dempsey (&#39;Grey&#39;s Anatomy&#39;) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline&#39;s partner in &#39;Lost&#39;).
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in matters of fashion.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, past and present - gathered at the annual awards ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one was absent from the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of the year.
Poker by Manuel Vicente
In &#39;Ace of Poker&#39; (Alfaguara, illustration by Fernando Vicente), Manuel Vicent presents thirty x-rays of writers he has met in his literary life (and in some cases in his everyday life).
He does not do so in the dreaded and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but rather seeks something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The journey brings excitement and Vicent does not spare scares or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reading pleasure, even on repeated readings.
Here are some observations.
About Albert Camus: &quot;In the pages of this book, I discovered that Middle-earth is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but cannot be named: the pleasure of counter-fate, a morality without guilt and an innocence without any god.&quot;
About Samuel Beckett: &quot;A nihilist, an allegorical Christian, he wrote according to his own nature and not intellect, something between helplessness and ignorance, with a blinding poetic humor, without meaning, as if it were the blade of the knife that almost killed him.&quot;
About Graham Greene: &quot;Our man has been wrapped up in passion for this woman for thirteen whole years, adultery, pleasure and remorse, which is a spiritual prerogative to reach heaven by way of damnation.&quot;
About James Joyce: &quot;This Odyssey was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand peaks in universal literature that must be climbed from the north side, from which the best climbers often fall.&quot;
On William Faulkner: &quot;He was a strange man.
On his own, he said of himself that he was the heir of a county landowner, at other times that he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, these were big dreams.&quot;
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: &quot;This writer captured the deranged cry of this man from Munich on the bridge, to carry its echo into the night of the 20th century in its literary form, running away from himself and calling to the future and speaking violently to the worms.&quot;
On Dorothy Parker: &quot;One day she knelt down and prayed, &#39;God my beloved, make me stop writing like a woman.&#39;
About Joseph Conrad: &quot;On his grave were engraved Spenser&#39;s lines: &#39;After toil comes a dream,/ After a storm a calm harbor,/ After war a rest,/ After a full life death.&#39;
On Virginia Wolf: &quot;He also carried his depression in his baggage.
Her husband fully agreed with her telling him that Edward VII had watched her among the azaleas, or that the birds sang in Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness.&quot;
On Pío Baroja: &quot;What else did Martín Santos want, other than targeting Joyce on Baroja?
What was Benet&#39;s business other than having Baroja executed with Faulkner&#39;s gun?
What else did Cel want to do but make himself famous at the expense of that man&#39;s fame?&quot;
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood, in the district of Fuenlabrada, and a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed by and our dog, a hybrid rescued from a shelter weighing no more than six kilograms, kicked him twice without saying a word, seriously injuring him.
Our indignation is all the greater because we see nothing amusing in such aggression towards a small and defenseless animal that was also on a leash.
And on top of that, the old lady&#39;s shock after this incident, when she encountered these individuals on a walk, she also began to fear for her own safety, because such a devil-possessed person who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same to a woman, a child, an old person or to anyone weaker than himself.
It happened at five o&#39;clock in the afternoon, on a Tuesday, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day.
Of course we filed a complaint with the nearest commissariat, but we doubt it was of any avail, and to avoid raising delicate questions, we state that these cowardly murderers were of Spanish nationality.
Outrage prompted us to announce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening to today&#39;s youth when they entertain themselves by tormenting a defenseless animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We don&#39;t understand where proper upbringing, respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helmets
Tire manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially among younger motorists, as both entities reported today.
The purpose of this initiative is to highlight the importance of wearing a helmet, as it is the only means of preventing head injury or death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin says the campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which &quot;means more than designing and manufacturing even safer products&quot;, and confirmed that it is also trying to fulfill this purpose in other ways, i.e. in the form of an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets when riding a motorcycle, under the slogan &#39;To be or not to be&#39;, is the first phase where notice boards will be placed in more than 500 motorcycle repair shops to reach the wider public.
Finally, the Michelin company pointed out that traffic safety &quot;is a constant problem&quot; for this company, which is a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles and whose main goal is to constantly improve the safety of its products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are increasing
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market is starting to recover.
The total of 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain was a 12.6% increase compared to 2008, and what&#39;s more, it was the first increase after 22 months of steady decline, according to figures from manufacturers&#39; and dealers&#39; trade union Anfac, Ganvam.
However, it is better to put the favorable figure in quarantine, because November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison and it meant a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
The consequence of this is that, despite the increase over the last month, the total number of registered vehicles for the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous accounting year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling into the category of light commercial vehicles: passenger car derivatives, pick-ups, vans, smaller trucks and light trucks/chassis.
And the gloom that most harms demand has not disappeared, even though they were bought by private individuals, most of the purchases were made by small and medium-sized companies, and in almost 100% of cases it is financing through third parties.
To the restrictions resulting from the closure of the source of bank loans, other factors such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of a bad economic situation must be added.
In the given situation, unlike passenger cars, the 2000E purchase support did not help much.
In addition to private individuals, it is necessary to mention persons doing business under the trade license of small and medium-sized companies who intend to purchase a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, Ganvam reminded again that special attention needs to be paid to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers&#39; association assumes that the development in 2010 will be similar to last year and, according to calculations, sales of passenger cars and 4x4s will drop by 19%.
An auxiliary system for the handbrake is already mandatory equipment.
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock system, it will also include ESP stability control, auxiliary handbrake systems, all of which will become mandatory equipment for European cars.
In fact, it already forms part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for others the deadline for eliminating the deficiency is set, which is February 2011.
The measure introduced in the EU aims to increase the protection of pedestrians, while it works in such a way that it can help prevent many collisions.
The handbrake assist system increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency, which the system detects after the driver depresses the pedal.
But he can&#39;t always sustain this pressure until the end.
According to a study by auto parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of drivers involved in an accident did not hit their brakes before a crash, and half of them did not use their full brake force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires the maximum from the braking system, it shortens the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of device, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
The reduction of this number will be even more striking - according to calculations, one out of four accidents with an impact on persons would be prevented - after the introduction of so-called intelligent handbrake systems.
In this case, the vehicle will be equipped with a system that (using radar or a camera) detects obstacles and reports them to the driver, in addition to light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help him increase the pressure on the pedal if needed.
If the driver does not react, even if the collision cannot be avoided, the device applies the brake as intensively as possible and reduces the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, told Opel employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April -probably on April 8- as reported by Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer points out that on fulfilling the recovery plan for Opel will need more time.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to ensure that each point of the plan is first agreed with the party concerned.
And as a result, the final document, which will be presented first to the employees and then to the governments of the individual countries where the production plants are located, may be issued with a delay in early 2010.
GM, on the other hand, assures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken these days.
Not surprisingly, the Swedish government increased the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM is making contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also wants to acquire Volvo, but is considering the possibility of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which operates under the auspices of the Russian group Converg.
In the event that no agreement can be reached with either, GM could sell some of Saab&#39;s assets to China&#39;s Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year is still valid if it fails to sell.
Driving the Porsche Boxster Spyder
When developing this magnificent model, Porsche engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, so the weight shows only 1,275 kg.
The basis was, in the first place, the automatic retractable roof is in canvas design with manual control, which reduced the weight by 21 kg; aluminum doors were also used, such as GT3, which means another 15 kg less; removal of air conditioning, 13; the reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters also contributed to a weight reduction of another 7 kg; after mounting the sports seats, an additional 12 kg, thanks to the lightweight 19-inch wheels, an additional five kilos.
And finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less, and replacing the door handles with textile ones means another kilogram.
Also offered with a dual-clutch PDK transmission, one vehicle was tested with the manual six-speed gearbox, mainly on second-class roads in California, on mountain sections with many twisty turns.
His behavior can only be qualified as untouchable.
Weight reduction does not mean that the vehicle does not press against the asphalt.
Quite the opposite: we haven&#39;t tested such a small and light model for a long time, which at the same time conveys such safety when moving around a corner, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete able to warm up his muscles during a short ride for the necessary time, until we order him to sprint, brake, and resume the use of the engine...
Whatever we want. With steering that is as communicative as it is precise, whatever we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And he does it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of the V6 boxer, with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be amplified with the &#39;sport&#39; option and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine, which was previously used in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether during suction or recuperation.
The hinges are firm but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we drive the Boxster Spyder on was quite damaged, but the car handled the potholes well.
Electronic assistance was almost unnecessary during driving; and at the same time, in some corners we encountered frost and gravel at dawn even in the late morning.
Definitely, this ultralight car is one of the funniest on the market, as it is more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 at a price of 70,831 euros.
&#39;Bag Girl&#39;
Friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet at the company&#39;s shows, the singer flaunts her bad-girl face as vehemently as her Chanel handbags.

Baskonia awarded victory in Israel
The working cash register won brilliantly in 82-91 on their visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra pitch, despite the numerous absences in Duska Ivanovic&#39;s team, and thus got to the top of their group after a great performance by Mirza Teletovica, who with eight triple points was declared the best in the team ( 29 ratings).
The Vitoria team was able to compensate for the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Mico with a great amount of commitment and collective work, although they had to suffer until the end to get the victory.
In addition, great accuracy from the circuit with 16 triple points contributed a lot to the final triumph.
The match started head on for the Blues who were on the mark from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets for Vitoria were from distance already indicated that they attacked the Israeli team very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main scorers 18-20 at the end of the first period.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alava team opted for the inside play of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, who was received with whistles and applause when returning to his original place of work, to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to show himself as the best in his team with 13 points, although &#39;without six&#39; in Splitter&#39;s evaluation already indicated that it would not be the best night for the Brazilian.
But although the match was tight until the break, it was not decided in the least and the Maccabi wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone wins on their pitch, and with the &#39;hand of Elías&#39; they managed to win.
Eidson and Pnini certainly contributed to the &#39;yellow&#39; returning to prominence (50-49).
More inappropriate
The members of Ivanovic, wounded but not dead, needed a few precise games to catch their breath, and then appeared the machine gun Mirza Teletovic, who with three triples almost in a row and with the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring number (54-67), which the locals reached at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Alaves scraped their skin in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow anyone to deprive them of the well-deserved results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter sent off for a foul, Ivanovic did not rush and defended well, and although the Israelis came close to the final minute (80-85), the game already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in the season.
Injuries make it impossible for Unicaja to fight
Unicaja lost heavily in Greece to Olympiacos, leaving them in charge of Group B in the Euroleague in a match that was marked by three attacks from Unicaja, but mainly the inside play (Freeland, Lima and Archibald) that facilitated the Greek victory.
The Málaga team was not intimidated by the environment of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship or the opponent, perhaps one of the sickest in Europe, and with a big budget.
The play in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. Aggressive defense and three straight 3-pointers, two by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, lit up the field with 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the inside game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis turned the score 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when a battle between the props of the USABeverley and Williams meant that both players were sent off.
The Greek team started to work and showed their superiority in both zones, where the absence of the English pivot due to injury Joel Freeland and three personal errors by Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja team
Between the interior players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas with three points, they increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible revenge
The third part was very attacking from the side of Olympiacos, who, despite losing by 19, showed superiority and even managed to equalize the difference from the match in Málaga Málaga 66-48, minute 27, which shook the lead in the group.
Unicaja were trying to overcome absences and the recent absence of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last game.
Despite all the disadvantages, Unicaja, thanks to the leadership and triple points of Cook and the contribution of Lewis, left some hope for a win 66-57, minute 31.
But it was virtually impossible as Olympiacos proved unstoppable thanks to reinforcements and dominance in centimeters in their zone.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic managed to equalize the basket average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja withered and handed over the lead to Olympiacos.

During the week that the application has been running, the search engine has found that the Spanish worker in general &quot;feels poorly paid&quot;, Albert Rivera, responsible for Trovit&#39;s product, explained in his report.
According to data available to Trovit from its UK and French search engines, the Spanish are the lowest paid.
The British programmer takes 45,226 euros gross per year and the French 31,059, while the Spaniard receives 24,000.
Similarly, a driver has a salary of 34,247 euros net per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.

Brazil set a date for Zelay&#39;s departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic mission no later than January 27, 2010, when his mandate officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d&#39;affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that &quot;Mel&quot; knows he has to leave the embassy, where he has been hiding since September 21, by this date.
&quot;He is aware that on January 27, after the end of his mandate, he must leave and seek another refuge&quot;.
The station also quoted a former statesman as confirming his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: &quot;I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government,&quot; Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 election (where Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, that same week he tried to gain asylum in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed because Zelaya refused the condition of political asylum that the &quot;de facto&quot; government, headed by Roberto Micheletti, tried to impose on him.
Thank you
After the days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation represented the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has resurfaced in the markets, which should not be surprising as it is already a natural state in an environment where executives are making decisions about the future, which itself is unsure of herself.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize the market was to monetize debt through direct asset purchases and indirectly to release liquidity at a near-zero exchange rate so that financial institutions could purchase assets for deduction.
Central banks have already confirmed that outright asset purchases are virtually over and, without questioning their disjointed liquidity policies, are starting to throw some sand into the wheels, as the Bank of Spain did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain an economic recovery without such unorthodox measures, and we are participating in a return to risk-adverse returns.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads have regained points, although they are still a long way from the abnormal levels they reached at the start of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected public indebtedness.
There is a renewed push for quality and the US, Japan and Germany have become the haven of choice for investors, widening the differentiation of eurozone countries against Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this instability, but at that time Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s came and threatened a new downgrade review of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not unhelpful in silencing the advocates of moral hazard, who have again sought to burden the consciences of those responsible for world economic policy to curb the devastating effects of credit-to-employment restrictions, when in fact a new Thanksgiving should be declared.
However, the situation in Dubai represents tribal struggles between emirs to restore power in the emirates, and as for Greece, we have seen this before.
A government that covers the deficit, an election and a new government takes office.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to bail out Hungary from defaulting on foreign payments at the start of the year and to allow a euro member country to default on its obligations.
But what makes sense is for Ecofin to force the Greek government to be transparent and to commit its own citizens to joint responsibility when extraordinary measures are needed to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are ahead of a period of normalization of transitory risk premiums, they would be within expectations after some excesses in supported positions.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt differentials will increase just like European corporate bonds, we need not worry.
If European differences narrow and ours continue to widen, it would be a typically Spanish risk.
The Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s thing is just an anecdote. With our leading indicators forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their growth scenario for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not bode well for the Spanish economy to live up to this warning.
Again, it looks like this will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now, &quot;be careful, fellow driver&quot;.

Iberdrola President Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene yesterday before a subcommittee of the Chamber of Deputies, where Spain&#39;s energy strategy for the next two decades is currently being discussed.
After his intervention, which was followed by a speech by the president of Gas Natural-Fenos, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some comments about the proposal he presented to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the president of Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of 50,000 million euros by 2020 and another 60,000 million from that date until 2030, if the nuclear power plants that are currently in operation are kept.
If this does not happen, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 million but up to 95,000 million.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade, investments must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international connections
From 2020, the question is changing and performance will need to be increased.
Its offer is focused on gas plants and coal-fired power plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this case, he believes that a new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other &quot;supporting energies&quot;.
Galán, who believes that the draft law on sustainable economy, which has just been approved by the government, corresponds to the line that the business demanded, did not want to let the vein appear as a royal decree to support the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policy of combating climate change.
In his opinion, it is a &quot;clear long-term bet&quot; in this sense, despite the &quot;precise&quot; measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
Be that as it may, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must be made now, because they take time to mature and a stable tax framework is necessary for their initiation.
Ferrovial won the &#39;handling&#39; of Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial&#39;s subsidiary for airport ground services, the Swiss company Swissport, will play the role of the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at the ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, from which economic terms have not yet emerged, is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a cooperation protocol yesterday to create a Center for the Innovation of Smart Infrastructures
The association anticipates an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% belongs to Ferrovial.
One of the center&#39;s tasks will be research into energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona is aiming for its first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is vying for its first motorway concession in Australia, a market where it already operates as an energy and water utility.
The construction in question is a tunnel estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
Its rivals are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
A 5-kilometer long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast has become the closest option for Acciona to establish itself in this country as a highway construction and concession company.
City Hall wishes to have the tunnel completed by the end of 2014
After selecting a public-private partnership (PPP according to the initials in English) for the further development of the project in a business plan sponsored by Erns &amp; Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the implementation of the construction and operation of the toll.
The bids are expected to be submitted in the month of May, and the estimated investment will reach 1,700 million Australian dollars (1,047 million euros) and in the last phase three concerns with a significant presence in European constructions are competing.
The group, called Transcity, is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The former is one of Australia&#39;s largest construction companies and the latter, based in Italy, is one of Europe&#39;s largest underground construction specialists.
The Northern Direct concern with the presence of the British Laing O&#39;Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues is in the game against the Acciona group.
The third and last concern that passed through the sieve is called LBRJV and it involves the Australian capital Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, represented here by ACS), as well as the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and a major company specializing in civil construction He punched.
Australia&#39;s infrastructure market holds the promise of large-scale construction and privatisation, but carries with it the clear difficulty of entry other than through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
The strategy followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger is still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector, in addition to the Asian references.
ACS gained a market position through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Million assets
Acciona is betting on the geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm at Waubra (192MW) in Victoria and leads a group of businesses that is building and managing a desalination plant in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use the joint energy to enter the areas of construction and operation of infrastructures.
Promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Authority, the Northern Link toll roadway is to connect the Western Freeway from Toowong with the Kelvin Grove Ring Road (see map) in a 5km tunnel. This is Brisbane&#39;s largest traffic reduction event.
The calendar set by the local administration plans to award the contract in the summer of 2010 and start work in December next year.
Although this toll would open in the last months of 2014, full completion of the work is not planned until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will feature two streams in each direction, an electronic toll system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to finance it.
Brisbane has already offered Hochtief this contract
Australia is still making a significant profit for Hochtief as it yesterday announced a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
Joint venture ACS will operate the national fiber optic cable broadband network infrastructure through its local Leighton subsidiary.
This situation will allow fast access to the Internet for 400,000 people and will provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company abandoned the project to build the 27-storey King George tower in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work was yet to begin and Hochtief closed the sale for 129 million.
In Great Britain, specifically in Manchester, he will participate with Laing O&#39;Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centers for a period of 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC was awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded a 64.5 million euro construction contract for a 2.1-kilometer highway tunnel in Slovenia.
The company won the contract a few days after carrying out work on the expansion of the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore got advertising in Renfe
Renfe has assigned advertising and marketing services for the past two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore for an approximate amount of three million euros per year, the company operating the railway informed.
The contract includes an option to extend it by 12 months every year. Ms. Rushmore was chosen among 16 agencies that presented themselves in a competition called by Renfe, of which four advanced to the finals, among them TBWA, which was responsible for creating the ad for the last three years.
From this moment on, Sra will be Rushmore take care of designing and producing campaigns.
63 million fine for France Télécom for inhibiting competition
France&#39;s competition regulator has fined lFrance Télécom 63 million euros for anti-competitive behavior in the country&#39;s Caribbean territories.
According to this institution, the operator limited the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programs with consumers on the fringes of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has bought more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the competition watchdog believes that France Télécom has committed a similar offense as in the past and that there has therefore been a recurrence.
App store
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened an application store on the Internet with the aim of increasing revenues that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the start, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries such as Spain.
Playing in the Champions League brought 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça from the beginning
The Champions League has been a source of income for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth highest earning clubs in the competition.
The list is led by Manchester United.
The list is led by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League doesn&#39;t just bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
So much so that the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros among the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish ones) that have participated in the event since the tournament&#39;s inception in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA figures.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The white club was third on the continent with the most money won for participation and the only one along with AC Milan to win the top prize three times.
The Catalan current champion and the last winner of the defunct European Cup in 1992 is fifth in the classification.
The list is headed by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also charged the most money to participate in the last Champions League.
And that despite the fact that they both lost to Barça.
Spain, on the other hand, is only the third country to receive the most money through the Champions, despite having won the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure used by UEFA to distribute the money.
For this financial year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to earn 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA allocates 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary classification round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
in addition, those who achieved participation received 3.8 million just for their presence, in addition to an additional 550,000 euros for each match in which they participate.
There is also a bonus for a win (€800,000) and a draw (€400,000 for each team). Eight finalists will receive three million each; eight quarter-finalists3.3 million.
Each of the last four will receive 4 million.
The champion earns 9 million, while the runner-up earns 5.2 million.
In this way, the club will earn a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça received 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are variable payments for which 337.8 million is intended.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
The Spanish one is one of the main ones and has four allocated seats.
Last year&#39;s champion will receive 40% of the allocated money, second 30%, third 20% and fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will be played that year.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday published the details of the share purchase offer, with the help of which it wants to acquire the top position between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
This percentage does not oblige to make a public offer for the acquisition (option) of all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share, which it would repay in ten years and for which it would pay interest for this deferral of 1% per year.
Yesterday Sos shares ended trading at 1.85 euros; therefore, Nueva Rumasa&#39;s offer values the company at 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the €1.50 price reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 board members.
The Jerez Group provides a period of 15 days for shareholders to announce their interest in selling their shares.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the bid, although Ruiz Mateos&#39; company confirmed it had contacted the regulator.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to change its management structure.
In an attempt to stay on the sidelines of possible takeover bids and offset the judicial swings of its former leaders, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, the election of María Luisa Jordá as head of internal audit was announced.
This decision makes her the first woman to occupy a high position in a food company.
This is a newly created position that will report directly to the Group President.
And it is not exempt from controversy, as the company remains mired in a legal battle over the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from Sos to the Salazar brothers&#39; companies.
De facto, the possibility that Sos will reveal new transfers of funds in the coming months cannot be ruled out
Regarding the credit of the Salazars, former councilors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) testified yesterday at the National Court and confirmed that they approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
The CNMV allows the option to exclude Paternina, which participated in Inversora Mer
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorized the exclusion involving Inversora Mer against Federico Paternino9. October.
The regulator explained that it authorizes this operation as it understands that its conditions correspond to the applicable standards and considers the content of the explanatory brochure submitted after the adjustments introduced on 2 December to be &quot;sufficient&quot;.
The CNMV specified that the offer is aimed at acquiring 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of the company&#39;s capital, which is made up of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which will not be able to be transferred in any way until the closing of the offer, which specified that the price was set by Federico Paternina according to the provisions of the applicable norms.
New tools for car valuation
In these days of storms and accidents, not only car repair shops make money.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance event are towed to a service center where an expert must estimate the damage and repair costs.
No two claims are the same, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complicated job.
It can take two or three hours to manually calculate the cost of a repair from 20,000 to 30,000 euros, including parts and labor.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of experts use this kind of system.
Claims and maintenance estimating services and solutions providers are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers in order to develop and offer a useful tool to their customers.
In Spain, Audatex, from the American Solera group, is the leading company; 80% of the reviews are done with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of valuation and sector intelligence tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, they work with 63 manufacturers and importers in Spain, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to process continues to grow, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been introduced in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new vehicle enters the market, these businesses go to work.
It is a very hectic job as each of the thousands of vehicle parts must be cataloged and priced.
In addition, &quot;intelligent&quot; graphic processing&quot; is carried out for each model, where it is possible to &quot;punch out&quot; individual parts of touring cars.
For a model with massive sales, the job can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
For a minor car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
The most exclusive models they have information on include Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghinis, for example.
Regarding the rolling stock, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the work of documenting and developing databases, Audatex has eight centers distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros per year in developing these databases.
2.5 million entries are entered each month and customers receive updates every two days.
Processing this immense stream of information enables businesses to make different uses and deliver different products.
The most common uses are focused on repairs and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing spare parts or calculating the sale or residual value of the car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer them in our country, but they do in the United States.
With the products that Audatex offers, it is easy to get support that can be used by professionals in the sector.
The business offers ten different tools, with the star product being AudaPlus, a standard claims valuation solution for connoisseurs.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or paint shop.
This tool is pay-as-you-go for each assessment.
The highest price is 5.75 euros for customers who use it little, no more than ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which carries out thousands of estimates, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN enable complete identification of the vehicle and the equipment it came with off the assembly line based on just the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass, and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to scrap vehicles with a total insurance claim.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geodemographic analysis or finding variations by brand or model.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of a certain brand have been serviced due to an accident or how many have suffered serious insurance events during a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also intended for connoisseurs and likewise provides digital images, access to parts or prices, and official manufacturer times.
Gt Motive is an Einsa Group company founded in 1971 as a supplier of automotive damage, accident or maintenance assessment services and solutions
Gt Guía Valuation is its benchmark historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 service users, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Turnover has grown by 20% annually over the past three years and in 2008 they billed 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization began with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established itself in Spain in 1979.
According to company sources, 62% of its brother is produced in Europe and 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach 557 million dollars, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company earns 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth 1,000 million dollars on the stock exchange, and now its shares are estimated at a total value of 2,400 million dollars.
It has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 2007 and is included in the Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s benchmark index.
Online auction of crashed vehicles
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an internet base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The operation assumed the subscription of 59.5 million euros from 85% of the company&#39;s capital, which could be expanded next year by the remaining 15%.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more value-added services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This service of valuation and purchase and sale is guaranteed exclusively to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, repair shops, sales of spare parts and professional sellers, who must register before starting operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey stand out among the main markets.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and about 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been retired cannot return to service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Cars with historical value may be allowed to operate, although they have been scrapped, after preliminary control.
Service budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user gets a budget in just four steps: vehicle identification, spare part search, budget creation and budget generation.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially for the conviction of older professionals who tend to be more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, of which 666 are tourist, 109 off-road, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, you need a computer with an Internet connection to use it.
After identifying the model to be repaired using the chassis number, a real graphical representation of the model will appear and then the necessary spare part will be selected.
The user can include variables such as labor cost, surcharges or discounts, then print and give to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service oriented and does not involve manpower estimation.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which can be financed by the customer.
Audatex is currently working on making these displays three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome, as it will allow, for example, a door to be selected and rotated to reveal the inside.
