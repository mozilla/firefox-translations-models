Novák helped Trabzonspor to second place, Skoda also hit
Defender Filip Novák helped the Turkish football league Trabzonspor to the title of vice-champion with a goal in the last round of the Turkish football league.
His team won 2–1 at Kayserispor to keep third Besiktas behind.
Striker Milan Škoda scored his tenth goal for Rizespor after the January transfer from Slavia, which was saved even though he succumbed 1: 3 at Fenerbahce.
Novak confirmed the defenseman's excellent productivity with his seventh goal of this league season.
In the 63rd minute, goalkeeper Kayserispor just knocked out a fierce shot and the Czech footballer fired the ball into the net from an angle.
The home side managed to equalise five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor pulled the victory to their side in the sixth minute of added time, successfully finishing the four-on-one goal.
Škoda at the beginning of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce equalized after a solo at 1: 1.
Rizespor did not hold the tie for long, but he did not have to regret it, because thanks to the results of the opponents behind him remained three points above the relegation zone.
The competition will end on Sunday with the duel of the championship Basaksehir on the Kasimpasa course.
The well-hidden Cave at the Hermit in the woods near Nový Bor was not actually habitable
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, near Nový Bor in the Českolipsko region, in the forests through which the Count's Road led, there are several sandstone rock formations.
Both natural and man-made.
And we will go after the man-made hand.
The place is called the Cave at the Hermit.
In fact, no hermit ever lived here and the cave served as a shelter, more precisely a shelter chamber, probably for grain.
The cave is carved from the side into a rocky promontory and accessible by stairs from above.
At the same time, however, it is practically invisible until the last moment.
It is revealed only by the narrow stairs leading to a kind of rock gallery, from where you enter the rock.
Although it seems that the chamber is quite far from human habitation, at the time of its creation there may have been a field on the plateau where there is a forest today.
"The fact that the building does not have a window and no firebox located in the traditional place clearly proves that no hermit could ever survive the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podroužek from the Faculty of Arts of Jan Evangelista Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
The single-room building has only a stone bench at the back, apparently used for storing containers.
"I see it as a chamber for storing some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podroužek.
On the walls of the cave there are traces of tools.
Breaking off the sandstone with a canine was quite simple and fast for those in the know.
It was enough to use the joints appropriately and gradually break off the sandstone.
According to the length of the canine track and the method of mowing in general, it is possible to determine the period of origin of the cave.
According to the historian, it is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and, according to the mess that appears in it, someone sometimes sleeps there these days.
If you approach the cave from above from one of the forest paths and you will be attracted by the flowing stream and the nearby count's path under the cave, you will certainly find the trail down as well.
And on the way out of the forest, you may be captivated by the nearby Raven Rocks.
Jockey Minarik is in artificial sleep after a heavy fall in Germany
"Filip is in the best hands now.
The institute is equipped for such cases, and fortunately we have part of our family in Hanover.
This makes my situation much easier and also takes care of my daughter Finja," the server quoted Minařík's wife Katja as saying Jezdci.cz.
"Everyone is doing their best, Filip now needs time to recover.
There is no point in giving any forecasts.
Anyone who has ever encountered the issue of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great fighter.
We all have to be patient now and give him time," said the wife of the forty-five-year-old jockey.
Star Frankie Dettori, who won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes for the seventh time at Ascot on Saturday, equalled legend Lester Piggott, also called for financial support for the injured Minarik on Twitter.
Almost €70,000 has been raised on Gofundme to date.
The target is EUR 100,000 (CZK 2.6 million).
Video referee takes four goals from Sassuolo, they lost 2-0
Sassuolo's players got the ball into the opponent's goal four times in Saturday's match in Napoli, but in the end they had to accept a 0: 2 defeat.
None of their goals were conceded by the referee after consulting the video due to offside.
According to the Italian media, this is a record adversity of technology, so many hits have never been thwarted by VAR for one team.
"VAR was stricter than the road radar on Sassuolo and punished him like no other team before.
New technology is breaking records," Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a commentary.
"Sassuolo Festival of Unconceded Goals.
Never before has VAR been so strict on one team," added Corriere dello Sport.
Napoli took the lead in the 8th minute on Saturday, but after half an hour of play Sassuolo seemed to equalise.
Filip Djuričić's goal was disallowed after the video referee intervened for offside.
For the same reason, Djuričić's next intervention and the hits of Francesco Caputo and Domenico Berardi were also not valid.
The home team, on the other hand, added one more goal.
Electric cars report a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they were recharged the most in history
"The growth was driven by a 30 percent increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as by the accelerated development of registrations of new e-cars," said Tomáš Chmelík, head of ČEZ's clean technologies department.
Other large players such as PRE and E.ON, the manufacturer of electric cars Tesla, but also supermarkets Billa and Lidl are also reporting their share of the market.
Operators of conventional filling stations are represented by MOL.
But it doesn't have the numbers yet.
"We started building our electromobility network only last year," company spokeswoman Jana Jusková explained.
However, the editors of Deník exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by ČEZ.
They show that drivers took an average of 13.5 kWh from the stations.
This corresponds to the range of about a hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
Leaving aside minor pumping up to 1 kWh, the average charging takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refueling took place at a free tariff.
If motorists were already paying for the collection, their typical spending was around 330 crowns.
Electromobility is mainly driven in the capital.
All five of ČEZ's busiest chargers are located in Prague, and their popularity overshadows entire regional capitals.
Olomouc leads among the regions.
On the other hand, the least interest is in remote stations in the border area, such as in Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1274 new e-cars were added.
In an extensive poll conducted by the daily "Czechs on the Move", eight percent of readers said they were considering buying an electric car for their family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Not just for better water retention.
Environmental activists protest in Prague
According to the organizers, the government's steps taken so far in the issues of protection and recovery of the Czech landscape and addressing the climate crisis are insufficient, and the speakers called on the state to take a more aggressive approach.
The event called The Last Drop was attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"For example, we have people who have been speaking out against the Turów mine expansion for a long time, there are people who oppose gravel mining near Uherský Ostroh, there are people who oppose the construction of senseless dams," said Marika Volfová on behalf of the organizers.
She said the protesters' main demands are the creation of a plan for water retention in the landscape, a drastic change in agricultural policy and subsidy system to promote sustainable agriculture, and a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources as soon as possible.
"The government is supposed to defend the interests of the people, not ruthless and devastating business," she said.
A stand with a petition calling on representatives of the Czech state to work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and restore Czech soil and landscape was placed on the Lesser Town Square.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as "End of rapeseed depot" or "Less coal, more newts".
Jan Škoda from the association Za voda pro lidi (For Water for People) came to Prague from South Moravia to protest against the plan to mine gravel in the Hodonín region.
"It threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that boreholes represent the fifth most abundant source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned gravel extraction is located only about 500 meters from the boreholes and according to the assessments it is certain that the water quality will be endangered.
Vojtěch Veselý came from the village of Valeč in the Karlovy Vary region to represent the so-called agro-ecological farmers.
He pointed out the virtues of small farms that do not chase after yields and profits and supply residents directly on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the whole population in a completely normal way, but on top of that they don't wreak such havoc on the countryside and the environment," he said.
Three people died when a plane crashed on a house in Germany
An ultralight plane crashed on an apartment building in western Germany today killed three people and injured two others.
Local emergency services said two crew members and one resident of the house were likely among the dead.
The plane crashed onto the roof of a building in the town of Wesel in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of five housing units in the house, was subsequently engulfed in fire.
Firefighters have already managed to bring the flames under control.
Deputy Fire Chief Robert Meyboom said both crew members were believed to have died.
The third victim, according to police, is a woman who lived in the house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ), citing the mayor of Wesel, wrote that she was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute was found near the accident, which apparently served as a brake during landing.
Police believe it comes from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people in the plane.
The machine took off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post, citing eyewitnesses, reported that the plane collided with a hot air balloon before crashing.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, citing other witnesses, wrote that the plane broke up in mid-air before hitting the ground.
Česká spořitelna incorrectly charged some card payments twice on Saturday.
The error has already been fixed
Česká spořitelna mistakenly charged its clients twice for some card payments on Saturday afternoon.
According to the bank's spokesman Lukáš Kropík, the problem could have affected thousands of transactions.
The savings bank has already eliminated the error and returned the money to clients.
Problems with double billing of card payments were noted by the savings bank on Saturday afternoon.
"Yesterday night (Saturday) night we updated the system and immediately returned all these double payments to clients.
At the moment, everything works without problems," Kropík said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank deducted money from card payments twice, the bank spokesman does not know, according to his estimate, it was lower thousands of transactions.
The causes of the problems are investigated by the savings bank.
"It could have been a combination of several factors," Kropík said.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by the number of clients.
At the end of March, it had 4.6 million.
The savings bank is owned by the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market of Central and Eastern Europe.
Vojtěch will present a system of three emergency levels against coronavirus on Monday
"The grades will be based on the strength of community spread at the regional level.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtěch told Czech Television.
It will be a so-called traffic light, individual regions will be marked in green, orange or red according to the risk of coronavirus occurrence.
The minister added that he will discuss the inclusion of individual regions with epidemiologists.
He admitted that only the Moravian-Silesian Region would currently have orange and Prague would be approaching it.
The map will also include individual measures for regional hygiene stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to solve it at the regional level, because the situation in them is not uniform," Vojtěch said.
Water sprite and Karolínka
When the water sprite Jonáš and the miller's daughter Karolínka look into each other, they do not have it easy at all.
Jonáš's love is prevented by his father, the grumpy water sprite Hastrbuch, while Karolínka has no idea that her dear Jonah is not human.
Luckily there is a young man Libor who will do everything to protect the whole village, and especially Karolínka, from the water sprite villain.
What does it matter that he will plot and lie?
Especially when she manages to make Karolínka reject Jonas and prefer him, the brave Libor.
Soon it becomes clear to everyone in the village who is to blame for the drowning of the night Teapot, spoiled flour, mill fire and other rogues.
The angry villagers arrange a hunt for the water sprite, and on top of that, an implacable water sprite curse falls on Jonah's head.
And now advise Konvička's little soul to Karolína!
How to soften old Hastrbuch, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and free him from the spell?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in the Czech Television studios and in the exteriors at the Brzina pond, in Obděnice in the Sedlčany region and in the beautiful surroundings of the historic mill in Hoslovice.

The course of the disease of most is mild, only three percent of infected people have to go to the hospital
Either a milder form of coronavirus is spreading through the Czech Republic, or the summer dose of sunshine has significantly improved our immunity.
Infectious disease wards of hospitals are half empty, even as infection numbers rise.
"The situation today and in April is completely different and it is mainly due to the number of hospitalized," confirms Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth remembering that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic culminated in our country, everyone wore masks, the army took samples, the republic was closed and the Czechs consumed disinfection for a year in advance.
Yet ten people were dying every day.
Now the daily increases in the number of infections are higher, but a maximum of two people die with covid-19 every day.
The highest number of infections per capita still has Karviná, similar numbers already have Jihlava due to the outbreak in the local Alzheimer Center, where there are already 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the elderly was closed by hygienists in Černožice in the Hradec Králové region.
The disease was confirmed by tests in one of the nurses.
"We are tracing, we have restricted movement, we have all the hygiene measures," says the director of the retirement home Martin Schanal.
According to him, none of the clients of the home have symptoms of the disease yet.
Hygienists will start carrying out blanket testing tomorrow and then decide on further measures.
Hospitals are also responding to the increased number of infections.
The Oncological Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which detects whether people are wearing a mask when entering.
The record is reported by South Bohemian hygienists, who recorded twenty-five cases of coronavirus - most of them are foreign employees of the Prachatice company.
Overall, there were 131 new infections on Saturday — half of Friday's total — but fewer tests are being done over the weekend.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh finished writing a fairy tale, swept away Anderson
The big surprise of the tournament, Dimitri van den Bergh, also showed an excellent performance against the player who won the second most prestigious event in the PDC in 2018.
The beginning of the match was balanced on both sides, the turning point came at 8: 7 for the Belgian darts player.
Van den Bergh took the shot with a 13-dart leg and has had the upper hand ever since.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game and the significantly more experienced "Flying Scotsman" had a hard time getting to the doubles.
The way the "Dream Maker" had it in his hands is also evidenced by the fact that the tossed Anderson played his first maximum in the 24th leg.
In addition, the young Belgian managed great high checkouts.
The last time he lost was in the eleventh leg, but in an unfavorable state he "caught a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the match, Anderson was very frustrated.
Rather, he just threw away darts and his rival walking behind the triumph behaved absolutely masterfully.
Van den Bergh transformed the first of three match darts and lived up to his name - he wrote his big dream.
Winning the trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable for the Belgian darts player because it is his first major win.
It remains true that the last player who managed to beat van den Bergh is Karel Sedláček.
In Nantes, charges were made over cathedral fire, man confessed
The Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes caught fire last Saturday and the fire severely damaged the original 16th-century stained-glass windows and destroyed the organ.
Investigators investigated the suspected arson because the fire was advancing through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, police found no signs at the entrances that anyone had forced their way into the cathedral.
The accused is a volunteer at the local diocese, a thirty-nine-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without prosecuting.
Now, prosecutors have announced that based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faces arson charges.
If found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a heavy fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the action and has decided to cooperate fully with investigators, Le Monde reports.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will introduce a "traffic light" for epidemiological measures
The new system is intended to fulfill the role of a pandemic plan, the absence of which has faced criticism from the government and the Ministry of Health.
"The grades will be according to the strength of community spread," the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach the medium, orange level.
The system is designed to be regional because the situation in individual regions differs significantly, he added.
The Ministry cooperated on the system with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IHIS).
According to the minister, specific measures will be linked to the individual levels, whether it is the obligation to wear masks or the organization of special departments in hospitals.
Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for an epidemiological plan to be created on the Prima Partie TV show, according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has been growing in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojtěch commented that nothing fundamental is happening, it is not appropriate to talk about declaring a state of emergency or reconvening the crisis staff.
With regard to the growing number of infections throughout the Czech Republic from Saturday, the government has again introduced the obligation to wear masks at indoor events of more than 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, currently 1,000 people.
The government's approach, which until the last moment was not clear what measures would come into effect, when they would come into effect or when they would be announced, has been criticized.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main actors should create a sense of security and, on the contrary, straighten out the confusion," Senator Marek Hilšer said in Questions.
Measures may already vary by region, for example, in Prague, from Sunday, the obligation to wear veils also applies in non-residential medical facilities, such as pharmacies or waiting rooms at the doctor.
The obligation to wear veils when visiting health and social facilities or pharmacies has also been introduced since Friday in the Liberec and Ústí regions.
In the Vysočina region of Jihlava, it is necessary to wear veils in indoor public spaces, in public transport and in medical facilities from 14 July.
On the contrary, anti-epidemic measures have been relaxed in the Moravian-Silesian Region, as well as in the Central Bohemian Region in the Kutná Hora Region.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved the so-called traffic light for Europe, which distinguishes the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and accordingly adjusts the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
For low- and medium-risk countries, since 15 June, the authorities have not required Czech citizens to test negative for coronavirus or order quarantine instead.
These are mandatory when returning Czechs from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU Member States are now in the low-risk category.
The technoparty in the Benešov region continues.
It plays at a third capacity, it was supposed to finish at noon
Hlavackova Lhota (Benesovsko) Technoparty at Hlavackova Lhota in Benesovsko continues on Sunday evening.
A third of the original 12 music systems are still playing.
According to evening police estimates, about 500 people remain there after 20:00, the original rough estimates spoke of three hundred, in the morning there were 900, police spokeswoman Lucie Novakova said.
Originally, the techno party was supposed to end on Sunday at noon, at which time some of the music systems actually went silent.
"Some have already left and others are preparing to leave.
The music production is still partially ongoing.
We expect that music systems will be gradually disconnected and dismantled," Novakova said.
"Police officers are still consistently checking departing visitors in order to prevent drivers under the influence of alcohol or drugs from driving.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breath test before leaving," she added.
The event is supervised by dozens of riot police officers, the Alien Police, traffic and riot police, and dog handlers with service dogs are also on standby.
"During today, police officers checked 470 people moving around the venue and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, of which six got behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Novakova said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested for narcotics and psychotropic substances, of which one was positive.
Police officers also dealt with 14 traffic offences.
At the request of the technoparty participants, police officers conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.
About 2,000 people were at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants did not decrease, the police would intervene.
This was said by Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) on the Prima Partie TV show.
However, the number of participants was reduced below 1,000, so the police assessed that the intervention was not needed, nor did the public health station or the Ministry of Health ask for it.
Czech Television (CT) reported on Sunday that the techno party had spread to surrounding land whose owners did not agree with the use for techno parties.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will claim damages.
Techno fans arrived at the meadow near Hlavackova Lhota on Friday evening.
Police originally patrolled a meadow in Blažim in the Benešov region on Friday, where the techno party took place last year.
Blažim is located about 30 kilometers from Hlavackova Lhota, where the technicians actually came together.
According to Nováková, no one came to Blažim.
Viper bite: The little girl ended up in the hospital!
"This year's first case was recorded in the Železná Ruda region.
A viper bit a girl in the leg, born in 2010, who was brought by her parents to the local ambulance base," Mária Svobodová, a regional spokeswoman for the emergency medical service, told Deník, adding that the child was then transported to the hospital in Klatovy.
The viper is the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic and it is in Šumava that these animals occur in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful during walks.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance that you will be bitten by a viper is not very high, during normal contact it is afraid of itself.
And if she has the space to do so, she likes to crawl away with a loud hiss.
It will only attack if it feels threatened a lot - for example, if you accidentally step on it.
Even her bite is not a tragedy, its venom is very effective against small mammals, but it does not kill humans.
This can happen only if a person has a particularly weakened organism, or suffers from an allergy.
The risk of danger is therefore mainly in children, the elderly and allergy sufferers.
"A person often feels nauseous, sweats, has an elevated temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, and anaphylactic shock can occur in weakened individuals and especially allergy sufferers," Miriam Gredová from the Klatovy hospital told Deník.
The man threatened to throw the infant out of the window.
He poured wine and threw dishes at the policewoman
After 11 p.m., a riot squad entered the apartment and detained the man.
The infants were immediately taken into the care of paramedics, regional police spokeswoman Markéta Janovská said in a press release.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police, threw dishes, knives or poured wine on her from the window.
He amplified his threats several times during the negotiations by leaning out of the window with the baby in his arms.
Once he even climbed on the sill of a window himself, where he staggered.
Police continue to investigate the man.
He does not want to release further information yet.
Stosur will prefer her daughter to the tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not be involved in the coronavirus-affected season this year.
The thirty-six-year-old 2011 US Open champion, who became a mother in June, does not want to end her career just yet.
He plans to return to the courts next year and believes that thanks to his family and daughter, he will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Two weeks ago, Stosur announced on social media that her partner, Liz Astling, gave birth to daughter Genevieve in mid-June.
"I'm going to stay home, spend time with my family, be part of all the little milestones our Evie will experience in the next six months and just enjoy it," the former world number one doubles player told the Australian federation's website.
The WTA Tour will resume the interrupted season from March on August 3 with a clay tournament in Palermo.
Sapa Market: Raid reveals meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the premises was transporting 1320 quail eggs of unknown origin, moreover in inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in a disposal plant," the State Veterinary Administration said.
When inspecting the stall with live fish, it was found that the seller did not have documents of origin of the goods and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market has been considered a problem from a veterinary point of view for a long time.
For example, last autumn veterinarians discovered an illegal grocery store containing almost half a ton of unmarked food without documents of origin.
For most of them, it was not possible to determine the expiry date, some of the products had expired and were spoiled.
For five kilograms of cuttlefish, the expiry date was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police officers seized 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, squid and frozen ducks, some of which were moldy.
Putin spoke by phone with Zelensky before start of ceasefire in Donbass, Kremlin criticizes planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in Donbass, where a new ceasefire is due to take effect from midnight.
According to the Kremlin statement, Putin criticized, among other things, the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelenskiy had called for the release of the detained Ukrainians.
A new ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by negotiators from Ukraine and Russia, with the support of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The ceasefire is to begin after midnight on Monday, be "full and comprehensive" and pave the way for other provisions of the peace agreements to be fulfilled.
Putin told Zelensky in the interview that the Ukrainian parliament's decision to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects for settling the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Ukraine's parliament ruled last week that the upcoming local elections will not take place in territory controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement envisages that Kiev will regain control of Ukraine's separatist-occupied border with Russia after granting these regions broad autonomy and holding local elections.
According to the Unian news agency, Zelenskiy's office said that the two leaders agreed on the benefits of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbass and on the need to implement other measures to promote peace in the region, such as demining combat zones and withdrawing part of the troops from the front.
Zelenskiy also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, the occupied Crimean peninsula and Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement has helped stop the fighting, but intermittent firefights and artillery attacks continue to kill people on both sides of the front.
The conflict in Donbass has left more than 14,000 people dead since the spring of 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of supporting the separatists militarily, which Moscow denies.
Zelenskiy has made ending the war in Donbass his priority, but there has been no major breakthrough in the negotiations.
Rykl is an unexpected champion in the decathlon, Novotná dominated the heptathlon
The defender of the last two titles, Doležal, did not finish the four-hundredth at the end of Saturday's program, Kopecký did not jump the pole vault on Sunday.
The decathlon was long dominated by Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing in the group of coach Josef Karas, but after the discus withdrew.
Rykl has won two bronze medals from the outdoor Czech Championship so far, this time he was the only decathlete to get over the seven-thousander mark.
Other medals were won by Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbánek.
After the competition, Rykl recalled the absence of Adam, Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora.
"It's a pity that the boys weren't here and Kope didn't start because the results would have looked completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I put a personal 30 centimeters in the distance.
Then I was still pleased with the pole and the most disappointed was probably the discus, where I was below average, "he acknowledged on the union's Facebook.
Kateřina Cachová won the first day of the heptathlon with more than a hundred points, despite suffering from an injured ankle on her rebound leg.
In the long-distance sector, however, she registered only 570 cm, did not throw the javelin 40 meters and did not enter the final eight-hundred.
Novotná collected 5878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Kateřina Dvořáková.
She was especially successful in the distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wanted it to be around the 630.
Yesterday my calf started to pull, but I'm very glad that I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't limit me at all," Novotná said on the union's Facebook page.
Bio LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, promising ecological operation
Liquefied petroleum gas, abbreviated LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is especially popular for its fundamentally lower price compared to petrol or diesel, given by a significantly lower excise tax, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometer.
Like petrol and diesel, it also has its environmentally friendly variant - "bio LPG".
But it is quite a novelty - it first appeared on the European market two years ago and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association.
"These days, we have received the first fifteen tons of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our filling stations in a mixture with classic fossil LPG," the association quotes Jiří Karlík from Primagas.
However, bio LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to conventional petroleum LPG, which many motorists now refuel their cars.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions as desired.
"The only difference compared to conventional LPG is the method of production," says Ivan Indráček, chairman of the association, about bio LPG.
This is also one of the great advantages of bio LPG over other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and the distribution infrastructure is also quite good, for example compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product of the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted manner, e.g. from cellulosic biomass, i.e. wood waste.
On the other hand, conventional petroleum LPG is produced partly as a by-product of oil refining, partly by separation in natural gas extraction.
As a result, depending on the production technology and source, operating a bio LPG car is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than running on petroleum LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
However, it is not about CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, but about the ecology of fuel production, the so-called "well-to-tank" part.
Among the largest producers of bio LPG are currently petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility (NAP ČM), Unipetrol is also exploring the possibility of production in its Litvínov refinery.
According to the association's estimates, about 170,000 LPG vehicles run on LPG in the Czech Republic; The Ministry of the Environment states a slightly higher number in the NAP ČM, about 200 thousand.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 conversions of LPG cars were carried out last year alone.
It is possible to refuel with LPG in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of various operators.
Vojtěch revised the number of infected, the number decreased by 1775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) ordered the ministry to revise the number of people infected with the coronavirus virus.
The new statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
The number dropped from 5254 on Saturday afternoon to 3479 cases on Sunday afternoon, down 1775 cases.
Currently, there are 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"The jump in the number of cured patients is due to a revision of the data, which hygienists have not managed to update recently," said Jaroslav Dušek, head of health statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people had been infected with coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11,419 had recovered and 371 had unfortunately succumbed to Covid-19.
Mobile voting units or postal voting.
Political scientist and sociologist looked for options for the pandemic
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), a change in the law is needed in order for people in quarantine due to the coronavirus to be able to vote in the October regional and Senate elections.
Parliament could debate it in August or September under an accelerated regime.
He stated this on Sunday in Partia TV Prima.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of parliamentary parties at the ministry.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law," Hamacek said.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution within the framework of the existing legal rules.
However, the minister said that it would be necessary to amend the provision of the law under which people in quarantine cannot vote due to a health condition.
The ban on voting should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop said in the OVM programme that the possibility of postal voting has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the Chamber of Deputies, envisages its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the fears of ANO or ČSSD (because, according to experience abroad, it would rather play into the hands of other types of parties) about postal voting to be overestimated.
Personally, he is against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a considerable possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that it is now necessary to invent ad hoc mechanisms (elections) that could be carried out this year and with the least possible health risk.
He considers it essential to be ready for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to take place in the Czech Republic.
He considers postal voting (whether only abroad or in the Czech Republic) to be one of the functional methods.
Others are the aforementioned voting units or the possibility of proxy voting within the family.
He added that there is an opportunity to learn how similar situations - elections in the time of coronavirus - were dealt with in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of the coronavirus infection, various types of elections in 67 countries have already been postponed this year.
Protests in Buhari: Pig's ears thrown at government building by demonstrators
Participants in a demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
It was the latest in a series of protests against "mafia-style governance" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for nearly three weeks.
Organizers are planning a nationwide blockade on Wednesday, DPA reported.
Today's protest, which took place for the 18th day in a row, had a weaker turnout than the previous one, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
By 8 p.m., about 300 people had gathered, and some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Demonstrators staged a theatrical skit in front of the government building, symbolically locking Prime Minister Borisov and Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev in prison in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the prime minister.
The resignation of both is one of the protesters' basic demands.
They also demanded the cancellation of the announced health care reform and an end to corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
Protest organizer Nikolai Hajigenov said on public radio today that a "peak of escalation" was planned for Wednesday in the form of a "nationwide demonstration in Sofia and blockades throughout the country."
He reiterated the demand for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as the calling of early elections.
The regular ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has previously said he does not intend to resign.
He justified this, among other things, by the need to guide Bulgaria through the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he replaced five members of his government team, though the concession did not calm the protesters.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government withstood a confidence vote in parliament.
Coach Bologna Mihajlovic no longer wants matches without spectators
Bologna football coach Siniša Mihajlovič has had enough of Italian league matches without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that from the new season fans will return to the stadiums.
"What we're doing here at the moment is not football.
I'm fed up with matches without spectators.
It's sexless football, it doesn't bring me any emotion, no joy.
Those matches are worse than training.
To play like this is terrible and I think I'm not the only one who thinks so," Mihajlovic said ahead of today's match against Lecce.
The coronavirus pause is followed by Serie A matches in quick succession, and although they are played only in the evening, their players are exposed to the heat.
"We play every three days in terrible heat.
In such conditions, you can't even tell how the teams are.
To end this season.
Those measures had to be taken to finish the competition, but I hope that from September the fans will be back, "said the coach, who in the past also led Fiorentina and AC Milan.
For Mihajlovic, this season is also extraordinary because he missed four months on the bench due to leukemia treatment.
"Despite my illness, the suspension of the league and everything else, we managed to take our team to the next level.
We want to keep growing and for that we need the players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We have been the target of a cyber attack by foreign states, Iran says
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and enterprises.
Some Iranian officials have said a fire that broke out this month at the Natanz underground nuclear facility may have been caused by cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told reporters, according to Iranian media, that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure faces "thousands of cyberattacks" every day.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them will be repelled.
In recent months, Mousavi said, there have been several broader cyberattacks, which were carried out by "certain governments and groups," according to Mousavi.
He did not provide further details about the possible perpetrators, according to Reuters.
Mousavi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are frequent in the summer.
An article by Iran's state-run IRNA news agency this month suggested that Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the US, may have been behind recent incidents.
Neither country has been directly blamed for the specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States broke off diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution when Iranian militant students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-strained relations between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have hit its economy hard.
Another major escalation came this year after the U.S. military killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi Muhandis on Jan. 3.
On January 8, Iran fired a number of missiles at bases in Iraq where the Americans operate.
The U.S. only admitted with hindsight that dozens of U.S. soldiers had been wounded.
Israel considers Iran its archenemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA has extended the production shutdown, now until May 25
Cologne-based Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has once again extended its production shutdown due to the coronavirus.
Production lines are expected to resume on the morning of Monday, May 25.
The ramp-up will be accompanied by dozens of hygiene measures, said Tomáš Paroubek, a spokesman for the carmaker.
Production has been stalled since the evening of March 18 due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The company originally intended to renew it on Monday, May 18.
According to Paroubek, the reason for the extension of the shutdown is closed borders and closed dealerships, so there is no one to sell cars.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100 percent from the beginning, i.e. in two shifts.
The company's key markets, such as Italy, the UK and Spain, have been hit by the coronavirus.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Kolín) said that the production shutdown at TPCA does not affect life in the city.
"At the beginning it was obvious, the city was empty.
But gradually the streets are filling up, especially now since Monday, when it has loosened up a lot.
So the city is full," Kaspar said.
According to him, there are no complications with foreign workers who remained in the dormitories.
"In those two months, we had to solve almost no problem," Kaspar said.
For example, Škoda Auto in Mladá Boleslav, which also interrupted production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed production on Monday, April 27, at all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
Neither plant is operating at 100 percent capacity.
The resumption of production in Škoda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night from Monday to Tuesday, the third shift, i.e. the night shift, took place in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after production resumed.
TPCA currently employs about 2500 people and the company is one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and also an employer in the Kolín region.
Cancer Killed Bride Shortly After Wedding: She Left a Message to Family
Gemma Sisson battled cancer for more than two years, and just when she seemed to have beaten the cancer, the disease came back again.
A thirty-nine-year-old woman who loved bodybuilding eventually ended up in a bed in a hospice, where she still managed to marry the love of her life.
Unfortunately, she succumbed to the disease.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message for those closest to her appeared on her Facebook account.
Gemma Sisson, originally from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
She and her boyfriend Ricky Moore, with whom she lived for more than 16 years, traveled to competitions around the world.
The thirty-nine-year-old played sports and lived a healthy life, yet she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma began a grueling treatment, radiotherapy, in the hope that she would recover.
After months of treatment, it really seemed that Gemma had managed to defeat the cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned, this time attacking the spine.
The bodybuilder and personal trainer underwent a ten-hour spinal surgery and then resumed drastic treatment, according to the British newspaper Daily Mirror.
But all was in vain.
Earlier this year, on her thirty-ninth birthday, doctors told her she had a few months to live.
In April, the pretty blonde finally decided to join a hospice in Leeds, where she was visited every now and then by her family, who even arranged a wedding for her with her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to a restaurant one last time for their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, a post Gema had written for her family appeared on her social media account.
"If this has been made public, it means that I have finally died after weeks of fighting too long.
Although I will be heartbroken for leaving my loved ones here, I will be so glad to get rid of what this terrible disease has done to me.
I can't thank Ricky enough who was by my side the whole time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time," she wrote on social media, adding that the pain and suffering finally stopped and she found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my followers on the social network," she wrote, adding that everyone should value their life and live it to the fullest.
Art vending machines sell sweat dating, mushroom amulet and memory game
For a hundred crowns, passers-by will get a pocket work of mostly beginning Czech artists.
They create pictures and other creations directly for artmat, so they know in advance that they have to fit into the size of 8.5 by 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"In the package there is always a curatorial text about the artist and then the work itself," said Petra Widžová, the curator of the project.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
The buyer can be surprised by what work of art he gets.
Currently, he can become the new owner of fanciful illustrations by Alexandra Štoplová or mini-postcards by Tereza Bonaventura, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23 in cooperation with Dora Dutková prepared a memory game associated with a walk through Prague.
The cards must be paired with house signs.
Ilona Polanski created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliána Chomová sell pocket packs of spirituality: the former offers a protective amulet made of tinder and divination cards, the latter a series of illustrations based on her comic book Spiritualists.
Salaries in health care will increase by a maximum of five percent next year.
According to Vojtěch, a larger increase is unrealistic
Salaries in health care could increase by no more than five percent next year, Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) said in the Václav Moravec Questions on Czech Television.
He considers the trade unionists' demand for an increase of up to 15 percent to be unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective equipment.
Hospitals now have their supplies, he said.
"I think the increase (in salaries) can be somewhere within five percent," the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation, when the coronavirus pandemic and government regulations against its spread have intervened in the collection of premiums since March.
Insurance company revenues fell at that time.
"A 15 percent increase seems unrealistic to me at the moment," Vojtěch said.
According to data from the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IHIS), the average monthly earnings of a doctor in acute inpatient care will probably reach CZK 88,312 this year, while nurses will reach CZK 47,498.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
IHIS data also show that the loss of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic in 2019 was CZK 34,125, according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
Trade union representatives said in June that they would demand a minimum increase of ten percent for 2021, ideally 15 percent.
They criticize the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must follow salary scales, and contractual wages in hospitals of cities, regions or private ones.
They are also calling for uniform pay scales for health workers.
For nurses this year, the difference will reach up to seven thousand crowns per month.
For doctors, for example, wages grew faster than salaries last year.
According to the president of the Czech Dental Chamber, Roman Šmuckler, trade unionists should perceive how the state is currently doing.
Due to the effects of the covid epidemic, the Chamber of Deputies recently approved an increase in this year's state budget deficit to a record CZK 500 billion, of which CZK 1.75 billion is to go to the remuneration of health workers in hospitals and social services.
According to Smucler, the board of health care providers does not agree with across-the-board salary increases next year.
According to him, hospitals and health care facilities should decide on remuneration, and the extra money should go to them through a reimbursement decree.
Vojtech also said that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
Chairman of the Administration of State Material Reserves (SSHR) Pavel Švagr said this week that the administration does not currently own any protective medical equipment.
It is awaiting the completion of the selection procedures.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March, when they were purchased.
According to him, the state should also try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies.
The scrubbing smart quarantine could be taken over by soldiers.
We are ready, they say
"Smart quarantine works, there is room for improvement, of course.
We will discuss this with the army tonight.
The army works perfectly and the question is whether they should not manage the whole thing again," the prime minister said on Sunday on his Facebook show "Chau lidi".
According to him, it is not possible to sufficiently interconnect IT systems and hygiene stations, which must gradually switch to more modern methods of operation.
According to the Prime Minister, the problems were in the Moravian-Silesian Region, where one of the current outbreaks of the epidemic are.
Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek told the Czech News Agency that he had no information about Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
According to him, the army is ready for this step.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on May 25.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by a ninety-member central management team established under the army as an advisory body to the government, led by former deputy minister Roman Prymula.
Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) criticized the scrubbing project on Sunday.
He, too, suggested that the army might take him back in.
Shortcomings in the project were previously admitted by the government commissioner for IT and digitization, Vladimir Dzurilla, who is in charge of it.
"The system works, but it's still being worked on.
For twenty years it was created independently and unsystematically, now we are trying to unify it in a few months.
It doesn't gallop.
People on the go, poor sanitation people on the go are adapting these new systems and actually catching the mistakes," he said.
Mayor of Ostrava Macura will not run again, because he does not want to "fool around in politics"
The current mayor of Ostrava, Tomáš Macura (ANO), will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is to try not to "fool around in politics," he told Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the presidium of the ANO movement, has been the mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, the candidate of the ANO movement in Ostrava won almost a third of the votes.
Macura originally wanted to serve only four years.
"I told myself that I would endure one term of office and with the experience in business I would be able to turn everything around and put it on its feet," he told Respekt.
He added that he had been persuaded to a certain extent for a second term.
"But for me, that's the maximum.
I don't want to fool around in politics," added Macura, who described himself in an interview as a heavy introvert who does not like frequent contact with people.
According to Respekt, there has long been speculation about Macura's possible end in the ANO movement.
Macura has criticized the ANO movement several times, for example for its alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Miloš Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few ANO personalities, he supported Zeman's opponent Jiří Drahoš in the elections.
Macura has no plans to leave the ANO movement, which he joined in 2017.
"As long as I feel that I can change something in the movement, that it is not a completely futile fight and that no one is going to interfere with me, I have no immediate motive to quit," he told Respekt.
Fifty-six-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura served, among other things, as the director of the manufacturer of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also sat on the boards of other companies.
Uber offering transportation services will return to Brno
Uber, which offers transport services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
This is a consequence of a change in the law, Brno City Councilor for Transport Petr Kratochvíl (ODS) said in a press statement on Thursday.
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet the conditions such as a taxi or a taximeter.
However, the change in the law has changed the conditions for operating regular taxis and alternative ones since July.
Kratochvíl has held several meetings with Uber representatives in recent weeks.
"Based on them, this company decided to return its services to Brno at the end of July this year.
This step is a consequence of a change in the law that allows this company to legally operate its activities.
The city has been acquainted with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," Kratochvíl said.
Uber has operated in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against it because the vehicles were not marked as taxis or the lack of a taximeter.
The court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting Uber from driving in the city.
Brno originally supported taxi drivers, but at the end of last year, Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions, Uber could have operated in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of it.
It will now return by virtue of a change in the law.
Since July, in addition to classic taxis with a flashlight and a taximeter, it has been easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications.
Too exuberant celebration in Brno: a flying chair landed one meter away from a person on the pavement
On Saturday evening, an office chair flew out of the fourth floor of an apartment building in Brno and landed about a meter from the pavement.
At that moment, a pedestrian was walking after him, who immediately called the police.
Upon arriving at the address in the western part of the city, the patrol noticed an open window, under which there was still a chair, and beside it several cans and cigarette butts.
"The noise coming from the room on the fourth floor indicated that there was a rather noisy celebration going on inside.
The officers walked down the hall to the apartment and asked the three young men present, aged between twenty-six and twenty-nine, for an explanation," police spokesman Jakub Ghanem said.
Babiš will discuss the request for Rafaj's dismissal with the ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats on Monday a request for the dismissal of the head of the antimonopoly office (ÚOHS), Petr Rafaj.
Rafaj's dismissal was called on by non-profit organizations at a meeting of the government's anti-corruption council and also by the Usti Region.
The Social Democrats say a replacement at the head of the office is in order.
According to information from the Czech News Agency, Rafaj was not invited to the Office of the Government on Monday.
His second term ends in the middle of next year, and by law he cannot be appointed a third term.
His dismissal is within the competence of President Miloš Zeman.
In addition to the appeal of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister also received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí Region.
The reason is supposed to be, among other things, Rafaj's recent cases.
Last week, the prime minister declined to comment on the request, saying he would familiarize himself with the materials and the governing parties would take "some position" on it.
He also said that he has not yet discussed the appeal with the president and has not arranged a meeting with him in the near future.
According to the statement of the Office for the Protection of Competition, there is no reason to dismiss because Rafaj has not been charged with anything.
The IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz servers wrote last week that police were interested in Rafaj's meetings with Governor Jiří Čunek.
The meetings were connected, among other things, with the decision on the competition for the controversial new Zlín hospital project worth eight billion, which Čunek is pushing hard.
Čunek admitted the meetings, saying that together they discussed his "Senate activities".
Rafaj speaks similarly.
The Ústí Regional Assembly called on the government to recall Rafaj at the end of June.
It also calls for a reform of the authority's decision-making mechanisms.
According to Deputy Governor for Transport Jaroslav Komínek, the Office's decision-making regarding public procurement is not transparent and has signs of arbitrariness.
Last March, the police intervened at the antimonopoly office over a toll tender.
In June of this year, news server Aktuálně.cz pointed out that Rafaj was using apartments written for the company of the influential backstage player of the ČSSD, Alexander Čuba.
However, the deposit of CZK 3.5 million for the apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj's account.
Rafaj has been the chairman of the Office for the Protection of Competition since 9 July 2009, and the former Social Democratic MP was appointed for a second term in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafaj's second six-year mandate expires.
The Antimonopoly Office Act states that the President may dismiss the Chairman of the Office on the proposal of the Government.
He may be dismissed only if he has not held office for more than six months or seriously undermines the dignity of his duties or the independence and impartiality of the office.
In the Blansko library, employees were collapsing from the heat.
Air conditioning will help
The new equipment will cost 740 thousand and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"For me, it's good news.
With three children we go to the library in the center of Blansko regularly.
In the warm months, however, it was practically impossible to stay there.
It was terribly hot and the air was bad.
Ventilation did not help.
That's why I'm glad for the air conditioning," said Petr Novotný, one of the Blansko readers.
According to the director of the library, Lukáš Dlapa, the temperatures in the building often climbed to over thirty degrees.
The southern wall of the building is glazed and on sunny days it works as a greenhouse.
"In addition, the sun rests on it for a large part of the day due to the curvature of the building.
At the same time, it is a big problem to ventilate the individual departments, because the windows must be closed overnight for safety reasons.
We often have thirty degrees in the library from the morning," said Dlapa.
The worst was the study and reading room on the third floor.
And one floor up, the exhibition rooms and the principal's office.
There was also an unpleasant climate in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"It happened several times that librarians collapsed at work and ended up on sick leave.
The problem also regularly arose in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, it was impossible to breathe," Dlapa said.
Originally, city representatives wanted to make air conditioning in all areas of the library this year.
In the end, there will be only three circuits out of five.
"Due to limited funding, only the most problematic spaces will have air conditioning.
Study and reading room on the third floor.
Furthermore, the cultural room and the children's department one floor above," informed Jiří Svoboda from the Blansko investment department.
He added that in the first phase, workers had already installed air conditioning and modified the wiring in the premises last autumn.
Approximately for 360 thousand crowns.
The Municipal Library of Blansko has almost three thousand registered readers.
Of these, about nine hundred to fifteen years old.
Chicago's mainstay has been driven away by the coronavirus.
Crawford gets back in the game
Not every infected athlete comes out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to players from the NHL, which is silent about the health of the players like a grave and does not publish anything at all.
Crawford was one of the few to step out of line.
The thirty-five-year-old native of Montreal was present only at the first training session, since then he has been absent from the lineup.
"I would like to inform you all that I have tested positive for Covid-19 and because of this I have spent the last fortnight locked in my house," he revealed the reason for his absence.
Fans no longer have to worry about his health.
Crawford is ready to plunge back into full load.
"It's amazing to be back.
I will do everything I can to get in shape as soon as possible," he added.
The experienced goalie won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a solid part of the goalie for the tenth season in a row.
The Blackhawks will first face St. Louis in the preliminary round.
Thousands protest in Israel against prime minister
Thousands of Israelis protested in several parts of the country against unemployment, corruption and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the coronavirus crisis.
The rallies took place, among others, in front of Netanyahu's private villa in the city of Caesarea, near his official residence and in a park in Tel Aviv.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, protests have been taking place regularly for several weeks.
Participants are demanding Netanyahu's resignation over a trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, as well as how the government is handling the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," one protester wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's well-known nickname.
"Everyone can see that the Emperor has lost his clothes," read another.
Seventy-year-old Netanyahu is the first Israeli prime minister to be tried in office.
He is indicted in three counts of corruption, fraud and breach of trust.
He denies all the accusations, calling them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial could take up to three years, with more than 300 witnesses called.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in nearly 60,500 people in Israel, which has a population of about nine million.
About 455 people have died in connection with the infection.
The Israeli government introduced quarantine measures in March to help reduce daily spikes in infections.
However, after the gradual easing of restrictions from the end of April, the number of infections began to rise significantly, especially at the end of June.
Netanyahu's critics say the government has not done enough to help self-employed people affected by quarantine measures.
The protesters are also bothered by the fact that the government is issuing sometimes contradictory instructions in the fight against the coronavirus.
The driver smashed the car against a tree and died.
The body had to be cut from the wreckage by firefighters
The tragic accident happened around 11 p.m. near Neveklov on a narrow district leading from the Slapy Dam.
The driver apparently flew down into the forest at considerable speed and smashed the car against a tree.
He died on the spot.
Firefighters had to extricate the body from the wreckage, cutting off the roof, among other things.
The circumstances of the crash are being investigated by police officers.
They ordered a forensic autopsy, which should, among other things, clarify whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.

Pietro Filipi abolishes discounts and bets on sustainability
Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a fundamental change in strategy.
He cancels discounts and no longer wants to churn out one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the biggest polluters of the environment is nothing new.
Billions of items of clothing end up in incinerators and landfills every year.
However, the view of slow fashion, often despised approach to dressing, has changed quite quickly in recent years.
Approximately half of Pietro Filipi's goods were sold at full price.
The other half, which was sold thanks to discounts, simply does not buy.
The company does not want to churn out one collection after another and at the end of each season to price products below their production price.
In addition, according to the owner Michal Mička, the times of new and old collections and blind following of rapidly changing fashion trends are gone.
"Most retailers count on discounts when buying goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
So it's actually a bit of a scam," says Pietro Filipi owner Michal Mička.
In addition, the company wants to support local business with its approach.
"Each of our products is made of carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothing that is timeless and over-season.
Worldwide, the premium brands segment is typical for the absence of any discounts, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not needed," adds Mička.
Giant graffiti represents RAF pilot Kurt Taussig
"The assignment was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought in the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The city management liked the proposal," said Vacek, who completed his work after fourteen days of intensive work.
It consumed about 300 litres of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Šanov.
He left the city when he was 15 years old.
During the war, because of his Jewish origin, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp, where he was held for several weeks.
However, thanks to the organization of Nicholas Winton, he and his brother managed to avoid a concentration camp.
In 1939, Taussig made it to the UK, where he volunteered for the Royal Air Force (RAF), and then underwent pilot training in Southern Rhodesia and Palestine.
He joined combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic several times and his native Teplice, which granted him honorary citizenship.
Forty-six-year-old Kamil Vacek, known to people in the field of street graphic art under the nickname Camo, has been working with spray paints in the streets of Teplice for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on areas that were set aside for this purpose by the then mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Storm Hanna Reaches Texas Coast
Hurricane Hanna arrived on the southwest coast of the US state of Texas on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight CEST overnight).
It hit Padre Island, Texas, about 24 miles north of Port Mansfield, and weakened to a tropical storm as it moved over land.
However, according to meteorologists, it still poses a great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
It brought with it strong winds and intense rainfall; along with localized flooding, power outages and various material damage, including damaged ships, have been reported, according to the Associated Press.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Saturday declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwest Texas and advised people to voluntarily evacuate.
The strongest warning was received by people from the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but in total the element is expected to hit an area of almost 500 kilometers before gradually moving over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, sea level rises, dangerous surf and isolated tornadoes could pose a threat," the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned.
This morning local time (afternoon CEST), the storm moved in the area of the US-Mexico border and was accompanied by winds of 85 kilometers per hour.
Hanna on Saturday became the first hurricane of this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic region.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometers per hour, but it gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour as it advanced to land, which again eliminated Hanna from the category of hurricanes.
Authorities urged locals to wait out the storm at home, not forgetting hygiene measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
Texas is one of the US states most affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
Due to the existing safety measures and the need to maintain social distancing, possible evacuations are also a major challenge.
Makeshift shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gymnasiums.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted to shelter evacuees who tested positive for the coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the virus.
Local authorities urged all evacuees to bring masks and disinfectant gels to the shelter if possible.
"It's not over yet.
We expect catastrophic flooding," said Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Forecasts say that in some places up to 300 millimetres of rain could fall in a few hours, in some cases almost 500 millimetres, which, together with the rise in sea level, could flood many coastal settlements.
Zeman to confer the rank of general on Colonel Lipka
On Wednesday, President Miloš Zeman will confer the rank of general on Colonel Pavel Lipka.
This is the result of an overview of expected events of the Ministry of Defense.
The reason for conferring the rank of brigadier general is Lipka's appointment in August as deputy commander of the alliance's multinational division northeast in Poland.
Lipka still serves as Deputy Commander of the Land Forces of the Czech Army.
Zeman's promotion was proposed by the government at the end of June.
From the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karel Řehka as deputy commander of the Multinational Division Northeast in Elblag, Poland, which commands units of the alliance's forward presence in Poland and the Baltics.
In March, Řehka became the director of the National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NÚKIB).
The government suggested to the president that he give Lipka the rank of brigadier general.
According to the Act on Professional Soldiers, a higher rank may be conferred on a soldier for the duration of an elected office or for the period of performance of a service task required by the conferring of a higher rank.
The post of deputy commander of an alliance division corresponds to the rank of general.
A soldier who has been awarded the rank has the same rights and obligations as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to an adjustment of salary corresponding to the rank.
The conferral of the rank lasts until the reason for which it was granted ceases to exist.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional preparedness and is a role model for subordinates.
It significantly participates in the performance of the tasks of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June about the proposal for promotion.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 p.m. at Prague Castle, attended by Minister of Defense Lubomír Metnar and Chief of General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by the German Minister of Transport, Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards are social distancing and wearing masks on planes and at airports, but the middle seats on planes will not have to remain unoccupied.
Reuters reported.
"I am glad that my colleagues accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer told the European Aviation Conference.
Germany's transport ministry added that the deal had been concluded by officials and had yet to be formally approved by ministers.
The measures agreed include a requirement to cover one's mouth and nose for passengers aged six and over, social distancing at security and airport check-in.
Aircraft must also be guaranteed sufficient fresh air and all information must be available in several languages.
Airlines will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules agreed by officials meet at least some of the airlines' requirements.
Different standards caused confusion.
On Arctic Svalbard, a temperature record fell, they measured almost 22 degrees
"A 41-year-old record has been broken in Longyearbyen," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
By evening, the temperature there had risen to 21.7 degrees Celsius, beating the record set in 1979 by 0.4 degrees, he added.
Longyearbyen is the largest city on Svalbard, located about 1300 kilometers from the North Pole.
Svalbard is heating up faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the dangers posed by warming in other parts of the Arctic — from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies last year.
According to him, the average temperature on Svalbard has increased by three to five degrees since the 70s of the 20th century.
By 2100, it may rise by as much as ten degrees if greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere are not reduced.
Rising temperatures in Svalbard can result in the melting of frozen soil, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads and airports, and can cause more avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming also threatens Arctic fauna, such as polar bears and seals, which depend on the ocean ice sheet.
Britons returning from Spain face a mandatory two-week quarantine
The UK cabinet also urged people to avoid all non-essential travel to mainland Spain due to the risk of spreading COVID-19.
The Canary and Balearic Islands are not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people have to self-isolate for two weeks.
The new rules come into force at midnight.
"Protecting public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," the UK Foreign Office said in a statement.
"We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the list of safe countries," she added.
As noted by the British newspaper Metro, the latest announcement will hit the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is a very popular holiday destination.
Among other things, Britons are concerned about whether they will be paid sick leave if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from holidays.
Neil Hunter, from Sittingbourne, for example, booked a ten-day holiday to Lanzarote and was due to depart on Tuesday.
The tour has been booked since December.
"The whole family was supposed to go, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as a train driver and I don't think my employer will accept that I will be quarantined for two weeks after returning from vacation," Metro quoted Hunter as saying.
In connection with Spain, there are fears that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
Over the past two days, there have been over 900 new infections in 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, with Catalonia, for example, trying to curb all nightlife to prevent people from gathering in large numbers.
The Czech Foreign Ministry has recently warned of an increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid area.
The model of electricity purchase from Dukovany will be discussed by the government
On Monday, the government will discuss the model for purchasing electricity from the planned new unit of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The bill assumes that if the purchase price is higher than the price of electricity on the market, all consumers will pay the difference through tariffs.
In the second case, when the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be reversed.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for consumers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for ANO) and the energy company ČEZ have previously stated that the more likely scenario is that people will save on electricity thanks to the construction.
On the contrary, analysts point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices on the markets is always uncertain, which developments in the past have shown several times.
The plan has previously been criticized by environmental groups.
"The feed-in tariff may be both below and above the market price of electricity.
Thus, the final impact at the time of applicability of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - with lower consumption or according to electricity consumption - with higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) said in the documents accompanying the document.
Havlíček said in May that he expects the wholesale price of electricity to rise and that people will make money on the Dukovany construction.
Otherwise, the impact will be in tens of crowns per year per family, which, according to him, is far less than people pay annually in electricity bills to support so-called supported sources.
He had previously estimated that the purchase price could be between 50 and 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatt hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposal of the amount, it should be included in the purchase agreement.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, which is now the most stocked by traders, is currently around EUR 45 (about CZK 1190) per MWh.
"With the difference between the purchase price and the market price of electricity of ten euros, the surcharge for an average household with a consumption of 3.3 MWh per year could amount to less than CZK 100 per year," the Ministry of Industry and Trade wrote in documents for the government.
"We live in extremely turbulent times.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be an explicitly speculative matter," Tomáš Voltr, executive director of the Energy Financial Group, previously told CTK.
The proposed law assumes that the purchase would be carried out by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, or a legal entity authorized by it owned by the state for a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the state, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for at least 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even repeated, but no longer than until the closure of low-carbon production.
The proposal defines a low-carbon generation facility as a nuclear reactor power generation facility connected to the grid with an installed capacity of at least 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček previously said that the new Dukovany unit should have an output of 1200 MW and annually produce nine terawatt hours of electricity, which would correspond to a tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The unit should be put into operation in 2036.
The financing model for the new Dukovany unit was approved by the government on Monday.
The state should finance the facility during construction interest-free, during operation it is expected to pay two percent interest.
The opposition disagrees with the financing model, and is also bothered by the possibility that Russian or Chinese companies would build Dukovany.
The state should participate in the construction by 70 percent.
The rest should be paid by ČEZ, which will also cover any additional costs.
ČEZ CEO Daniel Beneš told CTK in May that the expected sum for the construction of the unit at current prices is roughly six billion euros (approximately 162 billion crowns).
Contracts between the state and ČEZ on the construction of the new Dukovany unit will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Regional Development withdrew material on the promotion of tourism in the media worth two billion
The document, according to which the Ministry of Regional Development (MMR) planned to spend two billion crowns in the media, on the Internet and billboards on advertising holidays in the Czech Republic, was withdrawn from the comment procedure.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for ANO) told news server SeznamZprávy.cz that the material is still being worked on.
The document in eKlep (the electronic library of the legislative process) was highlighted on Friday by the Zdopravy.cz server.
The ministry justified the plan by the fall in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the media also saw a drop in revenue.
The proposal drew criticism from the opposition and tourism representatives.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the hlidacstatu.cz website, the Ministry of Regional Development planned to give money through the state agency for tourism support CzechTourism for advertising on television, radio, the press, on the Internet, billboards or areas at railway stations.
The largest part of the money, 700 million crowns, would go to television.
Most of it would be acquired by private TV stations Nova and Prima.
Print dailies and weeklies would receive 400 million, and the MMR would give the same share for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
Radio stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of which would again be private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and areas at railway stations or in the metro.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was supposed to start in mid-August and last for a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not yet in the form that should be presented," Dostálová told news server SeznamZprávy without giving further details.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09, Markéta Pekarová Adamová, the media would benefit from the advertising from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this blatant contempt will be hit between the eyes at the elections in the autumn," she tweeted.
Dostálová denies that it is actually about helping the media affected by the crisis.
"It may be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," she told Deník N on Friday.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
"Of course, we are still counting it, it can be less or more.
It's working material," she added.
The Save Tourism initiative does not make sense to a media campaign to promote domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for tourism companies, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," Tomáš Barčík, chairman of the initiative, said on Sunday.
If the two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should go to companies, not to the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
Broth from life, a tap of beers and death like a blade of grass
Also posthumous is the third album called A smrt je slůblo trávy (A smrt je slůblo trávy (A Death is a Blade of Grass) by the Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also left a year ago, on 24 May.
In Frič's discography it is the fifth item and, as with previous titles, the main emphasis is on Frič's poetry, of which he is an excellent interpreter.
Frič, born in 1949, was understandably influenced by the American beat generation, but he channelled this inspiration through his own, individually presented experiences and also very inner expressions of faith.
But he was far from agitation, when he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, absolutely tolerant.
Bohuslav Reynek comes to mind in this context (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček, for example), the masters will excuse me.
Frič's album offers recordings of the author's reading from 2006, as well as performances with musicians who have always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was the cellist Josef Klíč or Honza Bartoň and Vítězslav Holata.
I will help myself - gladly - with the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Frič's long poetic compositions.
"They radiated proud and never-ending bitterness," writes Hruška, "over the state of our world threatened with extinction.
A world that sinks more and more into the dull consumerism and greed, moving further and further away from what its soul was made of - the mystery of faith, humility and human closeness.
There was the nostalgia of those who know that few people are interested in the values for which they were created, but who also know that they cannot be renounced just because of a general lack of interest.
The poems were a reminder that one might have to lose everything expensive, but it is not immaterial how one loses it.
Whether he sells out to general decline, he resigns himself skeptically, falls silent fearfully, or remains until the last moment in a calm and proud insistence on what he believes and loves."
Paroubek is not my advisor, Hamacek said
Former Prime Minister and ČSSD chairman Jiří Paroubek is not a paid adviser to the Social Democrats.
Party chairman and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamacek said this today on the Prima Partie TV show.
The news server SeznamZprávy.cz reported on Friday that Paroubek should be Hamacek's adviser.
"From time to time we text each other, he sometimes sends me some material and I read it," Hamacek said today.
He added that this is not an official and paid cooperation.
According to him, the ČSSD does not have the means to waste them on similar purposes.
"The fact that I sometimes read his opinion, there are a lot of people like that," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MP Jana Černochová, the minister said that many ODS members still "openly listen to the opinions of Václav Klaus".
According to him, it is okay because he is an experienced politician and a former party chairman, which is also the case with Paroubek.
He called the fact that the media is making an affair out of it a sign of this year's cucumber season.
News server SeznamZprávy.cz reported on Friday that Paroubek fulfills the role of Hamacek's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the fourth place on the party's list in the Ústí nad Labem region is headed by the former chairman of the local cell, Petr Benda, who is associated with Paroubek and served as the vice-chairman of his party LEV 21.
Hamacek said today that he would not comment on the composition of the list until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a leap, it's a kick in the ass, laments the Swede's challenger
The 22-year-old American pole vaulter has the ambition and potential to be one of the new ruler's most serious competitors.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis, two years his junior, having beaten him at an NCAA college meeting last year.
"We had a battle the year before, he won and I was second, then we swapped it.
In both cases it was a very good fight," said Nilsen, who secured victory with a performance of 5.95 metres.
But Duplantis has since shot up sharply and is now alone in the highest pole vaulting spheres.
At the age of only twenty, he became the world record holder, this year on February 8 in Torun he broke the bar at 6.17 meters, a week later in Glasgow he added a centimeter.
"He was jumping six meters at the age of 18 when he finished high school," Nilsen recalled to the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that once he matured from boy to man, he would multiply all his potential and talent tenfold.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump a world record," he said.
Although Nilsen's list of achievements is considerably thinner than Duplantis's, the American has similar goals.
So far, he has indicated his possibilities at the NCAA races, which he regularly won, this February he improved his indoor personal best to 5.93 m at one of them. Last August, he won the gold medal at the Pan American Games in Lima, and in 2017 he fought his way into the U.S. team for the World Championships, where he finished 13th.
The next milestone for him is to get his first taste of the Diamond League.
"It's definitely my priority to get to the professional circuit and compete in the Diamond League as much as possible, because that's where you can make a name for yourself," he said.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly do the same at events like the Olympics, the World Championships or the Pan American Games."
But because of the pandemic, these peak holidays are postponed, giving Nilsen and the other pole vaulters time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch Duplantis, who can easily turn a race under the five rings into a mere battle for silver?
"Everyone is trying to catch up with him, but I don't think it's going to be possible anytime soon," Nilsen said.
"The kid has been jumping for 16 years and has a mile lead over everyone else in training."
And before Tokyo 2021 begins, he will want to increase it even more.
A woman spent hundreds of thousands of infirm son's disability pension.
She faces trial
The money that the 33-year-old receives from the state as a disability pension is intended primarily to improve his quality of life.
The woman faces up to eight years in prison for embezzlement.
Due to his poor health, the court deprived the sick man of legal capacity and appointed his mother as a guardian who, among other things, was to manage her son's money.
"Between mid-November 2013 and January this year, the woman used part of the funds from her son's disability pension for her own needs, depriving him of CZK 440,000," police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová said, adding that the accused woman was aggravated by the fact that, as a guardian, she had a specially imposed duty to defend the interests of the injured party.
According to the court's instructions, the woman opened an account for her son, but had his pension sent to her account.
"After paying the costs associated with her son's stay in a medical facility and paying for the necessary medication, she used the remaining funds to purchase a vehicle, electrical appliances and to run the household," the indictment says.
That she could not use her son's money for her own needs, the woman admitted.
But she defended herself by saying that she had helped them pay for family expenses.
"We had trouble keeping the household running out of our income.
We never bought anything above standard.
It was always for things that my son would approve of buying.
I considered it family money.
I had no idea I was committing a crime," the woman explained to police.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say after tools found
Finds from the Chiquihuite Cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 tools made of limestone, including fine blades that may have been used to cut meat, and pointed objects that may have served as spear or spear points.
Scientists have found that the oldest of the tools date back to 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are there," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies published in the journal Nature.
The youngest tools are 12,500 years old.
According to experts, people inhabited the Chiquihuite Cave, located at a high altitude, for 20,000 years.
The hitherto generally accepted theory was that the first representatives of the species Homo sapiens crossed the land bridge from the area of today's Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spearheads used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this Clovis culture subsequently spread throughout much of North America.
However, this model has been cracked in recent decades when several ancient settlements were discovered that were two to three thousand years older.
The second study, published in the journal Nature, reported 42 different sites across North America that showed human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people may have arrived on the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some of them could get to America by boat.
"It's clear that people were in America long before the development of the so-called Clovis culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta in Canada.
So far, interest in tickets has fulfilled the optimistic scenario, sellers say.
Prices are also gradually decreasing
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last summer, interest is still about half, but demand is growing by up to 20 percent every week.
According to sellers, the development after the crisis thus fulfils the most optimistic scenarios.
Ticket prices are also gradually decreasing.
According to sellers, the most sought-after destinations are mainly southern European countries.
According to Kiwi.com data, Spain, Italy and Greece are leading.
At the Letuška.cz portal, flights to Split, Croatia, are the biggest sellers.
Of the other countries, Great Britain is the most sought-after, but it has always been one of the busiest destinations.
The average price of air tickets is also decreasing.
For the Letuška.cz portal, it fluctuated around CZK 6250 in the middle of the month, down by CZK 3000 year-on-year.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices to some European places are also falling, such as Spain and Italy, which have fallen by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers, who now buy tickets much less in advance than before, fearing the further development of the coronavirus situation.
According to previous information Kiwi.com, the time of purchasing a ticket before departure decreased by about ten days year-on-year.
"This confirms the future trend where people will order tickets much less in advance, require more flexibility, take less risks," said Michal Šindelář, Vice President for Products Kiwi.com.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with the growth in sales, the number of renewed flights from the Czech Republic is also increasing.
Prague Airport currently operates regular flights to more than 60 destinations.
Compared to last summer's season, this is about half of the destinations.
Grand finale tonight!
Watch darts battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organization has reached the grand final.
It will feature the experienced forty-nine-year-old Scottish darts player Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, twenty-six-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pipa in the first round, then ran into his neighbor in the standings.
However, he also managed to cope with James Wade and in the quarter-finals he fought well with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world number one.
The "Flying Scotsman" had a tough time in the semi-finals, facing Michael Smith.
At the last minute, however, he escaped the gravedigger's shovel, dominated in overtime and after a result of 18:16 earned a place in the final of the tournament, which he dominated in 2018, when he defeated Mensur Suljovic 21-19 in an amazing battle.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament and perhaps knowing that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play on an absolutely fantastic wave.
The twenty-six-year-old darts player first surprisingly eliminated the world number six Nathan Aspinall, in a dramatic battle they also pushed Joe Cullen and in the quarterfinals after a sharp start he also defeated Adrian Lewis.
The big test was the semi-finals.
Glen Durrant showed his strength right at the beginning, but the calmly playing Belgian then gained an excellent series of leads, which he then held more or less without problems until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, which was met by occasional uncertainty on doubles.
Coronavirus cases have risen at least since the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, 15,212 people have been proven to have been infected with it.
Almost 9,600 of them have recovered, 368 patients have died.
Currently, 5,254 people are ill.
This follows from the data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week has exceeded two hundred four times in a row.
Friday's high was 281 cases.
On Thursday, 235 people tested positive, 246 a day earlier and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first working day of this week, there were 169 new infections.
9,590 people have recovered from COVID-19 in the Czech Republic, i.e. 63 percent of all those infected so far.
In most, the disease had a mild course.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, there are 151 people with coronavirus in the hospital, 19 of whom are assessed by doctors as serious.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days per 100,000 inhabitants still shows Karviná, almost 59.
It is followed by the Jihlava district with 56 and Frýdek-Místek with 36 infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infections, new measures against the spread of coronavirus have been in force in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People must wear masks at indoor mass events of more than 100 people, cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be reduced from the current thousand people to half.
In the world, the number of people who have been proven to have been infected with the new coronavirus has already exceeded 16 million.
This was reported by Johns Hopkins University, which monitors the development of the pandemic globally.
The death toll from covid-19 is close to 645,000, according to the source.
The latest million infections were added to the statistics in just three days; The 15 million mark fell on July 22.
The United States, which has registered more than 4.1 million infections, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where authorities say nearly 1.4 million people have been infected, have contributed the largest to the rapid rise in cases in recent days.
Infections are now rising at a record pace.
The World Health Organization reported this week that there were more than 284,000 new cases worldwide between Thursday and Friday, the highest daily tally since the pandemic began.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in populous countries such as the US, Brazil and India, but the number of new cases has risen in nearly 40 countries around the world over the past week, according to Reuters.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium and Israel.
The infection has already appeared in almost all countries of the world, the first case was officially announced today by the DPRK.
The air in homes is up to five times worse than outside.
Air fresheners and deodorants are harmful to health
Health is threatened not only by poor air quality outdoors, but also at home.
This was pointed out by Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, as quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
Abraham, who was instrumental in creating Israel's Ministry of Environmental Protection, said household pollutants need to be addressed now, when many people are spending more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned research by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), according to which the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year due to poor air quality in their homes.
"Due to the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced and continues to force many to work from home, people have had to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it's time to focus on indoor air quality," Abraham said.
In Israel, she says, almost no one cares about the quality of "domestic air."
Dangerous things that a person normally comes into contact with - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides - can be dangerous.
"The poisonous gas is also emitted by the clothes we regularly wear to the dry cleaners," Abraham said.
According to her, children, elderly household members and people with respiratory problems are most at risk.
Even otherwise healthy individuals may begin to suffer from problems such as headaches, fainting, nasal irritation, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergies.
With prolonged exposure to unhealthy substances, internal organs and the central nervous system can be damaged.
However, not all pollutants come from objects inside households, the source can also be the material from which the houses are built.
Quiz about Václav Havel: How long he spent in prison and what made him write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada lost the chance to advance to the top Spanish football league due to the coronavirus infection in the team.
The competition management canceled the originally postponed duel of the last round of the second league, in which the team could ensure participation in the playoffs.
Fuenlabrada reported another 12 infected people on Saturday, bringing the total number of positive covid-19 tests at the club to 28.
Due to the infection in the team, Monday's duel against La Coruna was postponed, in which Fuenlabrada needed a point to get into the playoffs.
The competition management said today that the match against La Coruni was definitely called off due to force majeure due to the fact that it was no longer played.
Fuenlabrada accepted the decision.
On the contrary, La Coruña rebels against not playing the match.
In the end, given the results of their rivals, even a victory over Fuenlabrada would not be enough to save them, but she considers it unfair that the last round did not take place according to custom complete in a uniform date.
The management of the former elite Spanish club is threatened with a lawsuit over its fall to the third division.
The top two teams of the table, Huesca and Cadiz, are assured of advancing to the elite.
Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche will compete for the remaining third promotion place in the playoffs.
Karel Gott did not like Václav Havel?!
Daughter Dominika revealed it
"Dad didn't have to do it for many years," she told Aha! Gott's eldest daughter, Dominika, said that the Master couldn't come up with Havel's name and whenever he was mentioned, Karel was always upset.
It's hard to say what they did to each other, but according to Dominica, the dispute began sometime in the mid-nineties.
"Dad said in an article after the revolution that it was easier for him than he was.
That Havel could have written in a drawer during the Dark Ages, but if he somehow resisted, his career would be over," says Gottová.
But then he adds that in the end, the Czech giants found their way to each other.
"I know that Havel could not have heard the word until his sixtieth birthday.
But then the president congratulated him with a letter on his birthday and suddenly my father's relationship with him began to change," Dominika recalls.
Ten years later, Gott even invited the former president to celebrate his seventieth birthday at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
"And that's where a new era of their relationship began, because Dad then regularly invited Mr. Havel to his home at Bertramka," added the blonde, whose father died last October.
Slavík is also said to have regretted that he had never received a state award from Václav Havel.
After all, he got it in 2009, even though it was already from the hands of his successor in the post of Václav Klaus (79).
The current president Miloš Zeman (75) is to award him the Order of the White Lion and honor his memory.
Heat threatens in Czech Rep from Tuesday, meteorologists warn of fires
Meteorologists' warnings of high temperatures apply for Tuesday afternoon for the whole of Bohemia with the exception of the Karlovy Vary region and also for southern and central Moravia.
"Exceptionally, temperatures can exceed 34 degrees Celsius, especially in Central Bohemia," they say.
People are advised to keep a drinking regime in the heat and limit their physical load at noon and afternoon.
Due to the warm weather with minimal rainfall, there will be a risk of fires from Tuesday morning.
Windy weather could contribute to their rapid spread.
Meteorologists' warnings about the risk of fires apply to Central Bohemia, including Prague, Liberec, Ústí nad Labem, Karlovy Vary and Pilsen.
A fire warning will remain in effect until further notice.
"We do not expect significant rainfall, which would mitigate the danger, in the northwest and west of Bohemia at least until the end of the week," the CHMI said.
Prague City Hall responded to the meteorologists' warnings by banning fires in risky places, which is to apply from Tuesday.
People in the capital will not be allowed to set open fires in, for example, parks, gardens or forests, up to 50 meters from the edge of the forest.
Smoking and the use of pyrotechnics is also prohibited in these places.
The measure will apply until further notice, Prague City Hall spokesman Vít Hofman said.
