The Prague Stock Exchange fell into the red by the end of trading
After the sharp fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares reached almost half of the normal daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange followed up on Monday&#39;s drop right from the start of trading on Tuesday, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, the drop is behind the fall in shares on Wall Street.
Here, too, the market&#39;s reaction to the result of the vote by the US House of Representatives, which refused to support the plan to stabilize the financial sector there, manifests itself.
Stocks fall in Asia
Shares on the stock exchanges in Asia experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indices eventually erased some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng index of the stock exchange in Hong Kong lost almost four percent during trading, but later erased part of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks Chinese shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell 3.8 percent, markets were closed in Shanghai.
Shares on the Sydney stock exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually pared losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock market in Taiwan, according to the local index, fell by 3.6 percent.
&quot;The timing of the US bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world,&quot; said Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it determines its monetary policy independently, i.e. without dependence on the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates on par with the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US lawmakers should urgently return to negotiations and approve the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will also feel the effects.
Bloodbath for US stocks
The US House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was supposed to cost up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion CZK).
Lawmakers thus ignored President George W. Bush&#39;s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
US stocks saw a bloodbath on Monday, with the major stock indexes posting their biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent, the last time it recorded a decline of a similar magnitude in 1987.
The index was already falling before the vote, but once it became clear that the proposal failed in the House, the index found itself in a free fall.
Congress backs down: The US government can pump $700 billion into the banks
Top officials in the US Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader bailout deal for the US financial system.
It will be voted on early next week.
American lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks on the approval of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the American financial system in the amount of 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
However, it has not been won yet.
Congressmen must finalize some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed on the floor of the House of Representatives on Monday.
House Banking and Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank told Reuters on Sunday.
According to sources, the Senate could probably vote on the plan as early as Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be approved should be the first significant psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
After that, however, there will be a &quot;sobering&quot; due to the complexity of the mechanisms by which to help the markets achieve this in practice.
Paulson: The plan has to be effective
&quot;We have made great progress.
We&#39;ve resolved our differences on what the market stabilization package should look like,&quot; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Lawmakers met with US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to finalize the government fund.
He should buy back unsaleable mortgage assets from financial companies, which drag financial companies into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
&quot;We are on the verge of final agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue with the recovery plan, but I think we&#39;re there,&quot; Paulson said.
Asian trading signal
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress on Sunday.
This is because they want to reassure investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone where the decision of Congress could affect Monday trading.
However, it is not yet clear with certainty when both houses of the US Congress will vote on the law, or whether the negotiations may stall on some issue at the last minute.
Lawmakers hope to pass it in the next few days.
However, the law will still undergo a number of changes.
The total amount designated for the aid of the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, in a sequence of another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush praised the progress in the negotiations
Although the President can veto this decision, Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to raise funds to buy back bad mortgage securities that have fallen in value because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, remained intact.
&quot;We worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday,&quot; said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President Bush is also satisfied with the progress in negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday&#39;s progress and appreciated &quot;the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.&quot;
Restrictions on golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the lead negotiator, said lawmakers agreed on accountability for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing relief, timing funding for the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and establishes a committee that will supervise the fund.
It should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
&quot;We&#39;ve been working very hard on this and we&#39;ve made great progress toward an agreement that will work and be good for the market and good for all Americans,&quot; Paulson said.
The plan also includes help for homeowners who are having trouble making payments.
The government should negotiate new repayments on the mortgages it buys to reduce monthly repayment costs for borrowers and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Patria Finance Chief Economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
&quot;And this is because it is not known by what mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be bought out.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government will share the losses,&quot; Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
According to Mark, whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not that important.
&quot;It is much more important that members of Congress agree this week that they support this plan and that they commit to it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that there will be approval is the most important at this moment,&quot; Marek emphasized.
The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, together they have 29 percent
According to the first preliminary results, Sunday&#39;s early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a noticeable weakening of both parties of the previous grand coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties.
The Austrian People&#39;s Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly heavy losses, where the position of the current chairman, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Carinthia governor Jörg Haider is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, but is losing 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last election in 2006.
The ÖVP fared even worse, losing almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of both of these major parties in Austria&#39;s post-war history, and especially for the People&#39;s Party, who called for early elections, a literally disastrous result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP withdrew from the coalition, the People&#39;s Party had a considerable lead in preferences over the SPÖ.
But the voters apparently punished them for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party chairman and current vice chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party&#39;s presidency.
Such a development would probably facilitate the path to the most likely way out of the election result, i.e. the restoration of the grand coalition of the SPÖ and the ÖVP.
Due to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ) preliminarily won 18 percent and the BZÖ eleven percent of the vote - however, the Social Democrats also expressed concern about a repeat of 1999, when the People&#39;s Party agreed with the populists (at that time the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 split from the BZÖ) on the joint government, which even caused sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already declared that he is ready to cooperate with any party and foresees a return to Vienna to national politics, is clearly betting on this development.
The Green Party also entered the parliament, but it lost slightly and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties apparently crossed the four percent threshold and did not get into parliament.
A knife-edge battle: MP3 players versus cell phones.
We will advise you on how to choose
While almost every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
From this it seems clear that it is better to buy just the phone.
Still, there are plenty of reasons to get a stand-alone player.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It&#39;s probably hard to buy a high-end, expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc&#39;s latest album.
On the one hand, such musical products do not appear on LP records, and there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if your shelves are crowded with art rock, jazz or blues vinyls, you probably at least dream of such a record player.
It&#39;s the same with music on the go, i.e. compressed music, simply put - music in MP3.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
It may be unacceptable for someone to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan will probably have a hard time trying headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes with plenty of room for everyone.
The selection is wide.
Battery life also matters
Some high-end music players can do a lot more than just play music, but that&#39;s what most mobile phones can&#39;t do.
No current device is as versatile as the telephone.
In addition to the primary functions, calling and texting, it can play music and video, record both, has a better, sometimes worse camera and can even navigate.
And if we consider smartphones and communicators, you will also have a small computer in your pocket.
It&#39;s a small miracle, after all, no refrigerator can grill and no TV can take pictures.
The universality of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the sooner the indicator on the display will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy guzzlers.
Few mobile phones can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, usually much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
With cheap mobile phones, therefore, expect that they will not play for more than a few hours.
If you still call for it every now and then, get another charger for work just in case - this also applies to more expensive devices.
You won&#39;t have this problem with MP3 players, even the worse ones last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem occurs when recording music to a mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector, and moreover, not all of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on a memory card, but only a few card readers can handle the miniature memory cards used in mobile phones without reduction.
With the exception of players (iPod), you do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and players already create their own music library sorted by artist name, album title, genre or even user ratings.
Some devices only display a tree structure of directories similar to Explorer in Windows and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with an operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones are more capable
When choosing a specific device, pay particular attention to battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output, and, of course, ease of use.
If music is primarily a background for you and you only listen to it briefly every day, for example on the tram, any mobile phone that plays MP3 is enough.
Which almost any mobile phone can do.
You don&#39;t even have to keep track of what music formats your mobile phone or player can handle.
MP3s will handle all of them, and the vast majority of music that will reach you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widespread, and in addition to it, the vast majority of devices can also handle music in WMA format.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
Better mobile phones also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
It is enough to visit the relevant website of the operator (or other provider) via the mobile internet and purchase the song or album.
This service in itself could be a strong argument for the purchase of a music mobile phone.
Unfortunately, the range of operators is poor and mostly limited to fast-release radio hits.
The prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry a mobile phone with them.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you feel the mobile phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you also always carry headphones with you or at least a wired handsfree.
If not, you can use the integrated speaker, which almost every mobile phone has, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music mobiles for many will be the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost under three thousand.
For three or four thousand crowns you can buy a very decent Walkman.
However, you will mostly be limited by the absence of an output for regular headphones.
The best and most technically equipped phones with a 3.5 mm jack for ordinary headphones cost up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, ease of use.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can be controlled by anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity of control with a previously common cassette player or perhaps a gramophone is obvious.
There is no danger of a collision in the form of accidentally switching on the mobile internet and subsequently a huge bill for data transfer.
Which device to reach for
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for removable memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the additional purchase of the relevant card, you can fit within two thousand crowns.
Be careful though.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive ones can handle even 8 GB memory sticks.
If you already have a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, go for Cowon, Creativa, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you don&#39;t have to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, go for specialized mobile phones - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokias and Samsungs).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of operation is thus close to a separate MP3 player.
The furthest in the industry is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman series mobiles have the same user interface as MP3 players sold separately.
The same service and in the same price range of up to four thousand crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (typically 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours), will be provided by MP3 players from the aforementioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively mature, and our operators offer virtually all services like their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, we are missing something here - a virtual operator that would force the classic ones to be cheaper.
He might not be gone for long.
We have already written many times on Mobil.cz about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
After all, this was also confirmed by the ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
After the European Commission&#39;s latest steps in the field of regulation of roaming fees, a paradoxical situation may arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really wants to get into the fight.
It may sound paradoxical, after all, we have three mobile networks here and a penetration of well over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to bet on the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák often echoes them, who has stated several times in the past that there is no room for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It&#39;s probably true that a classic operator with its own network probably doesn&#39;t have much of a chance anymore (after all, it would probably be difficult to find frequencies anymore).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought a significant reduction in prices, to which classic operators had to react as well.
At the same time, even before the entry of pike like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market, voices similar to ours were heard in Great Britain.
But it turned out that there is a place for such operators and they can be really successful.
After all, we don&#39;t have to go too far for examples.
In February of this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
At the same time, behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which in the Czech Republic owns, among other things, U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to operate effectively, they need far fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They do not entail relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators are usually profiled as low-cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS, but this is often balanced by a narrower range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half as cheap as its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, a bet on a novel target group can be quite a good move.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
&quot;The right guys choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust,&quot; says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a concept similar to that in Poland could catch on in our country.
Vodafone spokesperson Miroslav Čepický doubts this: &quot;The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offerings.&quot;
No chance in the Czech Republic, say mobile operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
&quot;We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look very promising.
Rather, Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region,&quot; said Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group, in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything so that no potential competitor arises.
The GTS Novera group has not been hiding its interest in launching a virtual mobile operator for a long time, which would like to take the next step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
&quot;We are very interested in being able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunication services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this option with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already managed to make progress in negotiations with some of them,&quot; says the group&#39;s press spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe he&#39;s looking forward to better times.
From unofficial information, it seems that we should see the first virtual operator perhaps by the end of the year.
For now, however, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
&quot;At the moment, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by any entity with a complex and serious project in this area,&quot; said Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2 in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrová, T-Mobil&#39;s spokesperson, adds, in a rare agreement with O2&#39;s statement: &quot;So far, we have not noticed any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which it would be possible to build on.&quot;
And he adds: &quot;It is unlikely that a virtual operator will appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this moment, we would have to have a concrete agreement on the table in order to be able to think in this short horizon.&quot;
Vodafone focuses its attention more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: &quot;We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
We consider this to be the most beneficial from the customer&#39;s point of view.
Vodafone&#39;s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet.&quot;
Responsible authorities - hand in hand with operators
The progress of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a drop in prices and thus also a drop in their profits.
So why facilitate the entry of such a competitor?
The fact that operators know how to pull together when it comes to something is also evidenced by the tussle surrounding the creation of U:fon.
Probably the biggest pressure towards the ČTÚ came from the T-Mobile company at the time of the creation of U:fon.
This is evidenced by the publicly accessible information from the website of the CTU.
Now, however, U:fon is suitable as an argument for not allowing a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová pointed out: &quot;The competitive environment of the mobile market was recently intensified by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another player would place high demands on it and above all on its services.&quot;
Considering this approach of mobile operators, the complete lack of interest of the Czech regulatory authorities is striking.
At the same time, it is not just about the position of the CTU, which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic - unlike Great Britain and other developed countries - does not have the authority to intervene in economic competition.
These belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
But he took his typical stance on the whole issue.
&quot;The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not interesting enough for traditional operators,&quot; said Kristián Chalupa from the department of external relations of the ÚOHS in response to our question.
A statement formulated in this way by representatives of the operators is probably not surprising.
This is more than reasonable from an office that is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses their position on the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: &quot;Abroad, where virtual operators normally operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to the reduction of prices for mobile phone services.&quot;
Apparently, however, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and the drop in prices do not belong to the interests of the ÚOHS.
In truth, what is shocking about the whole case is the touching consensus of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence suggests itself.
Just like the exact same price of gasoline at gas stations, it is surely just the work of chance and fierce competition.
&quot;The authority found no signs of anti-competitive behavior in this matter, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, so they do not have a corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual operators are most probably not available to the telecommunications regulator,&quot; Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of market dominance is one of the many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets prepared by the CTU, according to which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
Of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
But some legal experts offer a different point of view - the creation of a virtual operator always requires the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator - quite logically - has a monopoly on its network.
So they must necessarily be dominant in a certain segment.
Even if we do not accept this argument, it should at least be a warning for the ÚOHS that the three mobile operators proceed in a strikingly similar way.
At the same time, the complaints of a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles when dealing with all operators.
Shifting responsibility to the ČTÚ is then a relatively common trick in telecommunications, with which the ÚOHS gets its hands off the whole matter.
We have already met him in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, the extension of the CTU&#39;s powers to the field of economic competition in telecommunications failed to be implemented in the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, although many experts promised an improvement in the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know this more than well, but apparently their interests lie elsewhere.
It works when no one is looking
At the same time, the functioning of some pseudo-virtual operators, of which there are quite a few in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies issuing their own price lists for mobile phone services, but they are only partially public.
These are usually companies involved in multilevel marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies are usually only available to a select few.
The magic lies in the fact that the company appears to the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he will then receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
&quot;If the cases you are talking about occur, it could be a violation of the contractual terms, which we would deal with and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company in question,&quot; answered Martina Kemrová to our question about this issue.
But it is quite unlikely that a similar activity would not reach the responsible people from mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
At the same time, none of the operators opposes such a procedure.
They have significant profits from the activities of these companies, and at the same time - unlike real virtual operators - they do not threaten them in any way with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out possible problems: &quot;The law allows such speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
In addition, they have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot dispose of it to the full extent like ordinary customers of mobile operators.&quot;
But that should be at least strange to the CTU.
In addition, another question arises for the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to a similar procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It must be added that the ÚOHS has relatively strong powers to detect similar activity, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the operators&#39; explanation that they have no idea about anything like this and their business conditions prohibit it.
When will we not be the most expensive
As mentioned several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market brought about a noticeable drop in prices for services.
At the same time, in practically all countries where virtual operators were created, classic operators tried to more or less prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small or too saturated a market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was at these moments that regulatory bodies intervened, defending not the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual operator and others flocked to it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are tossing the whole case around like a hot potato.
From our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that ambiguity in competences is more than useful for them in these cases.
But let&#39;s not throw a flint in the rye.
If the behind-the-scenes information is correct and a virtual operator appears in our country really soon, the Czech mobile market may get moving again.
If any of the operators allowed the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS will hardly be able to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to four performances of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek ceremonially presented new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj on the occasion of Czech Statehood Day.
The anthem was newly recorded by the orchestra of the National Theater under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo vocals, choral and instrumental versions.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka took over the vocals.
The authors of the adaptations of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
He told Czech Radio earlier that he deliberately chose singers with young representative voices who are distinctive and popular to sing the solo versions.
&quot;From the beginning, I tried to make sure that both of them, and then also with the choir, had clear diction, that the text was well understood, that they were in harmony,&quot; he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj was heard for the first time in 1834 on the boards of the Estates Theater in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
She gained popularity and people spontaneously adopted her as their own.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first stanza of the song became a natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What does the &quot;new&quot; anthem sound like?
On Wednesday, Prague&#39;s public transport will also use a chip for the first time
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will go down in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket will board the metro, trams and buses.
At the moment, approximately one hundred thousand people who own an Opencard chip card can purchase it.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day and annual coupon (which will be valid from January 1, 2009) and have it uploaded to their chip card at the info centers and workplaces of the Transport Company in the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Paradise Garden, Kačerov and Luka.
As of yesterday, coupons can also be purchased online on the Dopravní Podnik website www.dpp.cz.
Over four hundred customers used the service by the afternoon.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget about the ticket windows in metro stations, where they had to regularly stand in long queues for paper tickets.
They buy the coupon online and it is uploaded to their Opencard card at one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
&quot;At these locations, there is a counter with trained staff available to passengers who will help those interested with online shopping and also upload the purchased coupon to their card,&quot; said project spokesperson Martin Opatrný.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to upload electronic coupons to Opencard in self-service machines installed in several metro lobbies.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, resemble ticket markers, and passengers may have already noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, IP Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
&quot;Now there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty,&quot; Opatrný added.
The coupon will be checked by the machine instead of the driver
The operation of the machines, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
All you have to do is insert the Opencard chip card into them and the previously paid coupon will automatically be uploaded to it.
Starting tomorrow, electronic coupons are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
That is, in suburban trains and bus lines numbered 300 to 499, which are mainly used by residents of Central Bohemian municipalities to go to the capital.
&quot;In the trains included in the Prague integrated transport, the conductors are equipped with card readers, with which they determine the time and zone validity of the coupons,&quot; explained the ticket control Filip Drápal from the organization Ropid, which compiles the timetables of Prague public transport.
Suburban buses have card readers built into the ticket office near the driver.
When boarding, it is therefore not only necessary to show the chip card to the driver, but also to attach the Opencard to the designated place on the side of the cash register.
This allows the driver to check the validity of the uploaded coupons.
&quot;If a passenger needs to check the validity of uploaded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information,&quot; Drápal added.
Passengers who do not ride suburban buses and will not remember when their coupon expires, can go again to the self-service machines, where the coupons are uploaded to the card.
Here, information about the validity of their documents will be displayed on the device&#39;s display.
Sudetenland wanted a referendum after the USA
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans applied for the integration of the Šumava region into the United States.
It follows from the letter, which is kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Science Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we at least want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly approached the US president with such a wish.
This is evident, among other things, from a letter that was preserved in a private archive and today is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Science Library.
In a letter, the Germans from Český Krumlov ask the American president not to allow the return of the &quot;Šumavska County&quot; - taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
&quot;We understood the situation correctly and we want to be really sure in saying that the American troops are coming to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,&quot; reads the letter, signed with the words &quot;People who have the fate of Šumava in their hearts.&quot;
Since annexation to Czechoslovakia allegedly gives the Sudeten Germans - knowing the Czech national nature - hope only for brutality, ruthlessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter beg the American president to take over the Šumava as a protectorate for the present and eternal times.
&quot;We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would grant this territory to some foreign state that oppresses and suppresses minorities and has contributed nothing, absolutely nothing to the victory of the Allies,&quot; the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of the vindictiveness of the &quot;Czech oppressors&quot;.
If the President of the USA allegedly doubted the mindset of the Šumava Germans, it was enough for him to organize a referendum in the Šumava county on whether its inhabitants wanted to become part of the USA or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a bit naive with today&#39;s knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses, it appropriately illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Even though the Czech Germans must have at least suspected that they would be expelled from the republic, very few of them even considered such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
During the war, as a German from Budejovice, he was deployed to the navy in the Baltic.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a POW camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
&quot;They believed that when they returned home, Czech would be useful to them,&quot; Chalupa said.
According to him, none of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war expected to be removed from the republic on the basis of Beneš&#39;s decrees.
You do not think, you pay!
An emotional campaign attacks the driver
The most expensive event focused on road safety in Czech history.
Even so, one could characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček promises that she will deter drivers from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, and also on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from speeding and alcohol behind the wheel.
And also to remind them to fasten their seat belts before they drive off.
He wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, also professional drivers.
And what will appear in the spots?
Mainly human stories that attack emotions.
And this is evidenced by the &quot;bloody&quot; slogan of the entire campaign:
You do not think, you pay!
The word &quot;don&#39;t think&quot; is written in capital letters on the paper.
And in the pool of blood is the word &quot;you will pay&quot;.
This is meant to symbolize that a person can pay for a moment of inattention with his own life.
The spots will &quot;haunt&quot; viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of accident victims are common.
He promises that this will reduce the number of accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and a whip for the driver
&quot;The sugar and whip system applies to drivers.
The sugar for them is that when, for example, they run a red light, they save time.
A whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk,&quot; says Martin Kořán, a traffic psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that&#39;s why information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertisements are needed, the psychologist says.
According to him, signs that warn drivers of dangers are already less effective.
&quot;If a static sign warning of danger is installed, it will probably soon blend in with the surroundings and drivers will not pay attention to it,&quot; pointed out Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The head of Israel&#39;s interim government, Ehud Olmert, spoke out for the return of practically all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published by the daily Jediot Achronot on Monday.
&quot;We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that almost all (occupied) territories will have to be returned, if not all,&quot; Olmert told the newspaper.
&quot;We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to cede a similar percentage (of Israeli territory) to the Palestinians, because without that there will be no peace,&quot; he added.
He admitted that the eventual return would also include East Jerusalem.
&quot;Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want to be run over by tractors or bulldozers, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem,&quot; Olmert noted, referring to two attacks in the city in July, when in which several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find &quot;a special solution for the Temple Mount, sacred and historical places&quot; that lie inside the Old Town.
&quot;Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That won&#39;t work,&quot; he further emphasized.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke in favor of Israel&#39;s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which, according to him, is an essential condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
&quot;I am not proposing to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of leaving the Golan,&quot; he pointed out.
&quot;The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with (the Shia movement) Hezbollah; they will have to give up the permanent support they provide to the terrorism of (the Shia movement) Hamas, (the terrorist network) Al-Qaeda and the jihad (holy war) in Iraq,&quot; the prime minister specified.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool
According to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, if the problem with Czech scientists who were accused in India of illegally collecting beetles could not be resolved, there would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister stated this in New York after today&#39;s meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
&quot;If it wasn&#39;t resolved, then yes, then there would be a certain cooling down,&quot; he stated after the meeting, which took place on the initiative of the Czech Republic.
Mukherjee said after the meeting that the executive can hardly interfere in judicial matters.
However, he said that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Darjeeling, under whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
&quot;His problem could be solved,&quot; said the minister.
According to Mukherjee, it would be best for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, to appeal to a higher instance.
He can then apply for bail and await sentencing at large, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner made the same statement during the meeting.
&quot;He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him,&quot; said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can enter into the whole matter is to provide &quot;competent legal support&quot; to the convicts, said the Indian minister.
At the same time, he said that the Indian side is already providing them with such help.
&quot;We have the highest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
Indians also recognize this,&quot; Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as CTK said, he emphasized to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
&quot;We really consider the imprisonment and indictment of these Czech scientists to be a profound mistake,&quot; he declared.
The minister avoided answering the question whether he had received a promise from the Indian side to look into the matter.
&quot;I&#39;ve already received quite a few promises,&quot; he simply stated.
Questions after the accident: Are bus stewards illegal?
The law does not know them, you are not allowed to walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of a Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arose as to whether stewards and passengers can move around the bus while it is in motion.
&quot;If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the steward is in conflict with the Road Traffic Act,&quot; says Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident in which a twenty-two-year-old flight attendant was killed last week was apparently caused by a truck driver who crossed the road with the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver at the time, in the least safe place in the car, although she has two other seats reserved.
However, the bus can crash or brake suddenly, even when the steward is delivering coffee or newspapers.
Whether the bus is equipped with standing places according to the technical license plays a role.
If it is not homologated in the bus, the passenger must sit.
Student Agency long-distance buses do not have parking spaces; which was also confirmed by Aktuálně.cz, company director Radim Jančura.
&quot;We discussed this with the ministry and at first they did not allow the movement of passengers.
They later revoked it and we came to the conclusion that passengers are allowed to go to the toilet while driving if they have their own seat,&quot; he said.
The steward does not know the law
&quot;There is no clear legal interpretation of the steward&#39;s role - no legislation addresses this role.
However, no legal regulation even prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only recognizes the term guide vehicle; does not define his rights and obligations,&quot; adds Hanzelka&#39;s spokesperson less unequivocally.
On the other hand, the director of the road vehicle operation department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the law deals with the issue sufficiently.
&quot;It depends on whether the bus has parking spaces allowed in the homologation.
That&#39;s the end of it,&quot; he says.
Buses are divided into urban, where there are standing places and a limited maximum speed, intercity with standing places with a higher permitted speed, and long-distance buses without standing places with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert
BESIP traffic safety expert Jaroslav Hořín does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
&quot;During smooth driving, there is not much danger, the situation can be compared to service in airplanes.
Even here it is not certain when the turbulence will come and the flight attendant can hit her head.&quot;
&quot;However, if the bus were to brake suddenly, of course the laws of physics apply.
Just like in a city bus or tram.
The safety of the stewards must be solved by the carrier with internal regulations,&quot; he says and also believes that the issue is unresolved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is willing to cancel services
Student Agency offers steward services as the only bus operator.
It employs two hundred of them.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their profession to be risky.
&quot;However, as soon as I get the impression that the profession of flight attendants is risky, I will cancel them.
Passengers can get coffee and newspapers upon boarding.
It would also save costs,&quot; he says.
Asiana director Alexej Litvin justified the absence of stewards in his cars as a concern for safety, which operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA.
&quot;We don&#39;t have flight attendants, we&#39;ve been against that since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident,&quot; he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
An immense tragedy has occurred
A young flight attendant from Pilsen, who had worked for the company for two years, was killed in an accident on the line to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably swerved out of the parking lane without using a turn signal and blocked the bus&#39; path.
Its driver tried to avoid it with a sharp maneuver, but hit it with the right front part.
Jančura denies that the two seats reserved for stewards&#39; rest are sold out.
&quot;These places cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked.&quot;
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the judgment of the court to compensate the girl&#39;s family, but expects financial compensation from the culprit as well.
Amendment of the law?
Out of sight
The movement of stewards on board the bus could be brought about by an amendment to the law, on which a thirty-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
&quot;However, she did not come to any concrete conclusion.
They don&#39;t even deal with buses too much, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones while driving,&quot; says expert Hořín.
&quot;The Ministry of Transport does not consider the stewards&#39; activities to be something that would fundamentally threaten the safety of passengers,&quot; concludes spokesperson Hanzelka, adding that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and occupational safety authorities.
The Czech Republic judges the battle for the seabed
He approaches an electronic wall map showing Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
However, he is not interested in a continent, but a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
&quot;The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
At the same time, the area is as big as the continent itself,&quot; says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the thirty-member team of workers at the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
His boss, director of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, monitors the interpretation and sometimes adds to it.
There is work ethic and enthusiasm.
The seabed hides a hitherto little-known world, rich in natural resources.
Oil, ores and other mineral resources can be found here, as well as hitherto unknown living organisms, which hold the key to, for example, the development of a cure for cancer.
Bottom larger than land
Today, coastal states have started vehemently bidding for new underwater territories.
According to the UN Convention, they are using their rights, which were agreed upon in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
According to the convention, it has an exclusive right to all the resources of the continental shelf.
&quot;Simply put, the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and its subsoil that is a natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the borders of the coastal sea, often even beyond the two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone&quot;, explains Mikulka.
The request that the country submits to the Commission for the delimitation of the outer limits of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
&quot;One of our tasks is to provide the commission with legal and professional technical assistance.
The commission has so far considered five applications, namely from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the three last-mentioned countries have succeeded,&quot; adds Mikulka.
The success of Australia, which was the first to significantly expand its underwater holdings, has recently received worldwide attention.
But New Zealand also won - the area of the seabed, which the commission admitted to it last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, or roughly six times the size of the country itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit that will accrue to them in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other states will gradually submit their applications.
They can do so up to ten years after they ratified the &quot;Montego Bay Convention&quot;.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, declared by the convention to be the &quot;common heritage of mankind&quot;.
No state has an exclusive position here.
The right to mine in this area is granted by an international institution established by the convention.
&quot;But the seabed is no Klondike&quot;, says director Mikulka in exaggeration, saying that its &quot;individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regime contractually anchored&quot;.
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the joint organization &quot;Interoceanmetal&quot;.
In 1991, according to the convention, it acquired the status of a so-called &quot;pioneer investor&quot;, just like the investors of a few other states.
It has the right to mine in the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is broken there, it is a kind of underwater replica of Tater.
&quot;It is possible to mine there on an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,&quot; says another Indian lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
Macedonian employee of the division Rober Sandev brings one such concretion to show.
It resembles a small potato or, with a little imagination, the mythical scheme that, according to legend, animated the Golem.
Dusseldorf&#39;s hope is Frankfurt
There are no shortage of big words in the letter of the WestLB board of directors to the employees of this bank.
The merger of the units of this Düsseldorf-based financial institution with Frankfurt&#39;s Deka-Bank will create &quot;the central institution of the financial group of savings banks for trading on the capital markets,&quot; we read in the letter, which became public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will bring a &quot;competency set&quot; to the transaction to ensure long-term returns.
And in general, such a connection can be a decisive impetus for further associations in the sector of regional banks.
Such texts are created when the board of directors wants to demonstrate the ability to act in a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only from the European Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, whose message to the state government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
A connection between Deka-Bank, known to savings bank customers for its investment funds, and WestLB, of whatever kind, has nevertheless been talked about for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
During the presentation of the half-year financial results at the end of August, the head of Deka-Bank, Franz Waas, made it known that he saw no point in the merger of his banking house from Mainzer Landstraße with one of the regional banks, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the board of Deka-Bank, which is supported by one half of the state bank and the other half of the savings bank associations, has authorized the board of directors to conduct talks with WestLB about joint business activities.
This could be deals on the capital market or part of them.
However, the discussions have only just begun, financiers point out.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the most important employers on the financial market in Frankfurt, is not the first to be talked about in connection with consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a while that Deka-Bank might merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba bank.
In the end, nothing came of this trio.
Shortly after the merger plans became public, the Hessian state government spoke out against Helaba Bank&#39;s participation.
The two remaining banking houses did not merge in this way either.
Instead, Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz acquired Landesbank Baden-Württemberg of Stuttgart.
Despite this, there were repeated speculations about the connection of Deka-Bank with regional banks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, the chairman of the board of directors of Helaba bank, commented negatively on speculations about the merger of his financial house with others.
However, regardless of this, there seems to be a growing belief that bringing the various public sector banking houses closer together is a must.
Now, after the elections to the state assembly in Bavaria, the merger of BayernLB with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first to begin to take shape.
This is not exactly good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers should increase, it gradually loses possible partners for such a connection.
In the south, it would only play second fiddle, despite the fact that it has so far faced the financial crisis significantly better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the connection with WestLB was banned by the Association of Savings and Savings Banks Hessen-Thüringen, which has an eighty-five percent stake in Helab.
Nord LB would be considered at most.
But geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how well the business models of the individual institutions harmonize with each other.
In June, Merl stated that the German Association of Savings and Giro Banks has not yet answered the crucial question of what business model should be used to ensure the future competitiveness of regional banks.
Everything could also end with the dissolution of WestLB, which of course no one in this institution wants.
That is why the letter from the local board of directors also mentions that they are trying to find a &quot;comprehensive solution&quot; for the entire banking house.
Time will tell whether and how it will be possible to connect the individual components with Deka-Bank.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the &quot;weekend with Italians&quot;
It&#39;s the first time for Elena, the third or fourth time for Luca.
But this time, Elena will be there as his girlfriend, so everything will be different, he says.
Behind them, at a five-liter Kaiser barrel, stands a thicker bearded man, demonstrating to two hundred Oktoberfest tourists how deep his throat can produce.
Elena first slaps Luca and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus park next to the Puorta Nuova station, four buses with the sign &quot;destinazione Monaco, festa della birra&quot; will leave this evening at 23.45, expected arrival at 6.30.
Three buses are occupied mainly by Italians, one bus is exclusively Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, they were already celebrating at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, that&#39;s nothing for Italians.
Marc, wearing a long faux-fur-lined coat and wide silver-rimmed glasses, owns the three buses.
He has been going to Oktoberfest with them for five years, this year alone he is organizing three expeditions.
At night there, during the day among beer stands, departure back at 10:30 p.m.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcome toast with Kaiser beer, brewed exactly according to the Bavarian law on the purity of beer, health insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses leave into the night, along the motorway towards &quot;Brennero&quot;.
Beer is not served, not yet.
The bus quickly falls silent, the passengers are asleep.
They are doing well, they will still need their strength.
They are built in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where many other buses with Italian license plates make one more stop on the number 8 highway just before Munich.
When Marco&#39;s group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at 7:30 in the morning as planned, about 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives his final speech, explaining the plan of attack.
First: Put on the yellow cap.
On it, on the left, &quot;Oktoberfest&quot; is written in a cockroach, next to it is the internet address of Marco&#39;s travel agency: &quot;conoscersiviaggiando.it&quot;.
Second, &quot;When the door to the beer tent opens, run!&quot; Marco calls into the morning air.
&quot;Run!&quot; Run and take the seats in the back of the tent.
&quot;Not to the front so you don&#39;t get in the way, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, spread out around the space!&quot;
The ointment costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don&#39;t forget to tip.
&quot;Show the security guards that we behave ourselves.
Once you leave your places, they&#39;re gone!&quot;
Third: &quot;Tonight exactly at half past eleven, be here again!&quot; do you understand
And up to the Wiesn, an area with beer tents.
Along the way, one member of the group hangs yellow caps as markers on trees, signs and even an election poster of a major Bavarian party.
It is necessary to prepare for retreat.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the &quot;weekend with Italians&quot;.
Exact data on visitor numbers are not available; there is talk of fifty thousand who make the trek across the Alps and pop into beer tents, ten percent of all visitors this weekend are said to have arrived from Italy.
The ranks of the Munich police will be strengthened by seven policemen from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which keeps national statistics, in which the Italians, ahead of the British (approx. 60 interventions) and the Austrians (approx. 80), occupy the first place with approximately 200 medical treatments.
The Hofbräu tent is especially popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate lenders
Just last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück emphasized that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It&#39;s good that this politician used the word &quot;relatively&quot; and included in his statement the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared from the crisis.
Because that happened last weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), a Dax-indexed financial house specializing in real estate financing, will receive a multi-billion loan from a consortium of German banks to protect against market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the said loan aid would go up to 35 billion euros.
Interest will have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only on the amount actually spent.
The money is said to come from private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to a newspaper report, this state financier refinanced extremely short-term projects for long-term projects for which he lent money, which is now no longer possible due to lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank&#39;s reserve shrunk by 95% to 2.37 million euros, and the share of equity decreased slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to last year, income from the increased value of receivables and from certain securities as well as from the cancellation of provisions for credit trading fell by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher income from reimbursements for the subsequent settlement costs during the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from interest compensation according to the tax code and for mediating trade for group companies, the sixteen percent decrease on the income side was still moderate.
The former state financier, after its privatization in 1990, burned out on mortgages for entrepreneurs, which were then separated from the portfolio of services and further managed by Aareal Bank.
Because too little was earned in classical state financing, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate now has to write off something from the value of its subsidiary, and these write-offs will have a &quot;major material effect&quot; on the profit and loss calculation of the whole group, as some vaguely hinted.
The fact is that there will be no dividend.
Already for 2007, it was shortened by two thirds.
Since taking over Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier of state and infrastructure projects.
It depends more heavily than other institutes on refinancing in the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the source of interbank loans has practically dried up, as banks guard their liquidity.
Every year, Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funds for refinancing for part of Depfa&#39;s loan portfolio - approx. 50 billion euros.
According to Hypo Real Estate&#39;s statement, the group&#39;s financial needs are covered by this loan for the foreseeable future and the company is protected &quot;from the influence of international money markets, which are currently largely unable to function&quot;.
Other sources said that thanks to this money, refinancing is ensured until the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to use money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for the Supervision of Financial Services (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate group on the market is now ensured.
That&#39;s what the bank&#39;s shareholders and creditors hope for.
But given the dynamism and intractability of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even completely excluded that the loan would not need to be fully used up.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the bank appeared to be on the brink of insolvency late Sunday afternoon, a bailout, even a preliminary one, fails to calm passions.
The share price fell by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, bond rates held up well.
While senior debt practically did not move, the rates of secondary bonds are losing more significantly.
This mainly concerns the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, logically, bonds with a maturity period after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate bonds initially looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability must be understood as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which brought it into the company by taking over Depf.
As long as the issuing banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to count on the payment of securities within their maturity period.
But it can also happen, which almost no one dares to hope for at the moment - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, with the news coming out at the same time as this partial nationalization, the probability bordering on certainty has now become a mere legitimate hope.
This will most likely lead to many sleepless nights for long-term creditors, when they will decide whether to waive their obligations.
Short-term investors can use the cut-off line at least to create a carry-forward of loss from previous accounting periods to exchange rate returns of later years for the purpose of future capital gains tax payments.
German special forces were held hostage during the liberation
The Egyptian government asked for help from Germany in solving the hostage crisis - experts have arrived.
When the situation escalated, special forces were prepared, but did not deploy.
Further details of the circumstances surrounding the release of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are gradually becoming public.
According to data from the Ministries of Defense and the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to the ministries, experts from the Federal Army and members of the anti-terrorist group of the German police GSG9, squadrons of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and also logistics experts from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk) were at the scene of the liberation.
However, according to a further statement from the spokesmen of the two ministries on Monday afternoon, German forces were not needed as the captors let their captives go and fled when they recognized signs of a forced liberation.
The Egyptian government is said to have accepted the aid offered by Germany as support forces for action on the ground.
&quot;Fortunately, that did not happen,&quot; said one of the spokesmen of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
Attackers kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian woman, as well as eight of their Egyptian guides on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After the kidnapping in the desert area in the south of Egypt, they moved the hostages in the border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as did the details of the release or possible payment of the ransom.
At present, the rescued are already well in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said that the freed hostages are in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the dismissal.
No information is yet available in Berlin when the rescued will return to Germany.
According to the &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper, all five tourists should, even with special forces, fly away on one of the Airbuses of the German Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvanas and the Bento Box Mystery
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is about to introduce herself on her first day at high school in Tachibana, the girls start giggling: the German girl is completely &quot;kawaii&quot;!
What does it mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from the manga. On his new exchange blog, he talks about Japan.
&quot;First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was already on my way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take a 40 minute train ride to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way myself, luckily I didn&#39;t get lost.
It seems that the start of classes in Tačibana is not as strictly defined as here in Lower Saxony.
Students start meeting after eight o&#39;clock and twenty minutes before nine a short meeting with the teacher, the so-called &#39;home room&#39;, begins.
But before the class started, I had to introduce myself.
However, I am not at all the type of person who likes to speak in front of people, let alone in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn&#39;t have a school uniform yet, I wore my host mom&#39;s old skirt, a blouse, blue knee highs and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this, I stood in front of the bench and tried to pronounce everything correctly: &#39;Sajónara Wo še Sylvana...&#39; - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that moment, I was very glad that I started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were whispering, giggling and waving and I kept hearing the word &#39;kawaii&#39;.
I already knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means &#39;cute, sweet&#39;.
Then I quickly sailed into my place.
The girl next to me smiled quite widely, she considered it an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the class was fairly quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was literally showered.
They talked over each other and giggled and asked me about the possible and the impossible - and it&#39;s really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone unpacked their bentos.
My host mom also made me a lunch box like this - and it&#39;s different from the boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and some kind of fish in a tofu batter.
Most of the time I have no idea what exactly I&#39;m eating here in Japan.
The stuff looks weird and tastes pretty new.
It is certain that everything is really good.
Well, maybe except for the pickled plums, bro!
Benta in Japanese schools is not just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a boy a handmade bento, which in this case is especially artistically decorated, and hopes to get to know the boy better during the break snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I&#39;ll see it here too.
&#39;Why Japan?&#39; my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said:
&#39;Because it just fascinates me.&#39;
After all, manga has been my favorite to read for years.
And in order to better understand these comics and their culture, I once started to learn a little Japanese.
So it was absolutely clear to me that I would have to come here one day.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and habits.
And they are highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technology and trends, on the other it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I&#39;ve never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;
The US House of Representatives rejected the bailout package
The first chamber of the US Congress narrowly passed a $700 billion rescue package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones index fell sharply.
In a ratio of 206 to 227 votes, the US House of Representatives rejected the government&#39;s rescue package for financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, no majority was found for the program, which should ease the chaos on the financial markets.
With a dramatic action, supporters desperately tried to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, urged lawmakers to vote in favor before the vote, even though he said the plan is not popular.
&quot;It&#39;s hard to get political credit for avoiding something that hasn&#39;t happened yet,&quot; he acknowledged.
Even during the voting, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or by 600 points.
The reason was investors&#39; fears that the state rescue package could fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index rose, only to fall sharply again after the announcement of the collapse of the package.
Experts are now expecting further serious turbulence in the international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, the approval of the House of Representatives and the Senate is required.
Even rats have feelings
When a rat or cockroach runs away from danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux believes that many animals also have feelings.
But how would it be possible to verify that they feel the same when they behave similarly to us?
Contributions of well-known scientists have been published in the Internet magazine &quot;Edge&quot; for several years.
In its series, SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question &quot;What do you consider to be true without being able to prove it?&quot;
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far, when we can&#39;t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least hope because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, once we start looking at another species and open up the questions of perception or consciousness in general, we enter impenetrable terrain because the hardware doesn&#39;t match.
When in danger, a rat will do what many other animals do: pretend to be dead, run away, or attack.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists infer comparable subjective experiences.
However, I don&#39;t believe in that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
This is partly because the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always involve the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its involvement in short-term memory and executive or control functions).
This extensive area is significantly more developed in humans than in other primates, and appears to be completely absent in other creatures.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them knowing who we are and the ability to plan and make decisions, there is reason to believe that humans differ even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could be hidden in the linguistic nature of man: because so much of his perception is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case we could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly be influenced by language, so animal consciousness, however constructed, would probably differ from most states of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to find out what consciousness might look like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor, due to special hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, its exploration presents us with great problems.
Most of my conclusions relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more accessible scientifically.
It would be possible to study the processes in animal consciousness regardless of their content, and this is precisely what is done in studies of short-term memory in primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But this approach, pursued by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses on the neural correlates of consciousness rather than the causal mechanisms: the two may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the non-frontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What does this mean for feelings?
I derive them from the fact that the emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in a brain that is aware of its own activity.
What we refer to as &quot;fear&quot; is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as bodily reactions) makes use of working memory.
Seen from this angle, feelings are closely linked to those areas of the cortex that characterize primates, and humans in particular.
In connection with the naturalness of language, a fine gradation of perception arises, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize states in order to attribute them to others as well as ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the cortex and brainstem areas devoted to bodily sensations, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could easily participate in the feelings perceived by several animal species.
Purely theoretically, I cannot oppose it, however I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to us as fear in rats and humans is probably felt by both organisms in the same way: But how is it possible to verify, says Pankseep, whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
The cockroach flees from danger - does he feel fear too?
From my point of view, mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the sameness of experience.
Admittedly, the neural comparison takes us further: rats and humans have similar brainstems, whereas cockroaches do not.
But is the brainstem responsible for feelings?
And even if it were possible to prove it in humans: how would we want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don&#39;t know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are likely to be fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness rests on special circuits and language), I study emotional behavior rather than emotional perception in rats.
In any case, in this case we can expect progress at the neural level if we measure the same thing in rats and in humans.
As with rats, I don&#39;t examine language and consciousness, I don&#39;t even examine feelings, after all I don&#39;t know if they exist.
It may be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than repeatedly throw myself against the wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Acting Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that the preparations will soon be managed directly by the President and the Prime Minister.
&quot;The government sees UEFA&#39;s decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize the EC together with Poland,&quot; Vasjunyk said.
&quot;However, this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has only just begun and there is still much to do in both countries.&quot;
Both hosts are faltering in the early fulfillment of the timetable for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for the European Championship will be reduced from eight to six.
&quot;We can&#39;t waste any more time.
We must now work as quickly as possible,&quot; said the head of the Ukrainian union Grigory Surkis.
&quot;UEFA will keep an eye on us.
An even more radical step was agreed upon in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish PZPN union was dismissed by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by an independent administrator, Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sports, Mirosław Drzewiecki.
There is said to be &quot;a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules,&quot; Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
&quot;We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that this step will not affect the preparation for Euro 2012.&quot;
Several teams from the first league were sentenced to forced relegation just last season due to manipulations, in the end even the start of the league had to be hastily moved.
Travel agents are seeing increasing numbers of bookings
It looks like winter will be good for German tourism entrepreneurs:
According to one study, there was a significant increase in the turnover of travel reservations for the following months compared to the previous year - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic growth, Germans&#39; appetite for travel remains undiminished.
Travel agencies saw a 31 percent increase in bookings for the winter season compared to the same period last year, the German Travel Association (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) said in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK market research institute, increased bookings are already available for the autumn months as well.
According to DRV&#39;s statements, the turnover for October compared to 2007 was about eleven percent higher.
The basis for these results are figures from GfK, which evaluates booking data from 1,200 German travel agencies every month and interpolates them to the overall market.
This result includes tour bookings that took place until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, trips to the USA are in particular demand, DRV said.
For these trips, the increase in bookings is about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters, are particularly desirable destinations for the Germans.
Above all, organized tours are in vogue, stated DRV chairman Klaus Laepple.
With regard to the rising expenses for energy and food, the costs here are &quot;easier to calculate for the client than with an individually organized holiday&quot;.
Laepple explained that consumers can save money by taking advantage of early booking discounts or all-inclusive deals, among other things.
Even in the summer months, the number of bookings was said to be very good, so compared to the previous year, a higher turnover will again be recorded - although according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
An outraged Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to advertise a new movie, talked about private things in an interview - and now she has problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her ex Dennis Quaid as a marriage destroyer.
He rages and strikes back.
The overdue war of the roses for ex-married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are engaged in a nasty feud - in public.
In an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the collapse of her marriage: &quot;Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful.&quot;
She said she learned about the extent of the fraud only after the divorce.
The impetus for this mental striptease was Ryan&#39;s PR work for her new film &quot;The Women&quot; - which tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid&#39;s reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was striking: It&#39;s &quot;crazy,&quot; the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News that &quot;Meg is repeatedly rehashing the history of our relationship and editing it.&quot;
Moreover, it is &quot;regrettable&quot; that their 16-year-old son Jack is again &quot;publicly reminded of the pain and radical changes that divorce is for any child.&quot;
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
He concludes his reflections on folding with this: &quot;Anyway, my life goes on.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family that is doing great.&quot;
Airfare and hotel prices are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to one recent study, flights in Germany were even cheaper by up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel accommodation have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the provider of travel and financial services American Express.
The company analyzed its data on reservations made in the first half of 2008 and after the rise in prices in the first quarter found a significant drop in the second quarter.
After several years of rising prices in the hotel market, accommodation in many places has already become cheaper.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 monitored European cities increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most noticeable in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than the previous year.
American Express considers the weak exchange rate of the dollar to be the cause of this trend, which caused &quot;the declining desire of American tourists to travel&quot;.
The drop in hotel prices also affected financial centers more than industrial centers, such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices even set a European record with their increase of 26.3 percent.
Ticket prices also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in the price of kerosene, Economy class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights became even more expensive by 29.2 percent.
From April to June, ticket prices in Economy class fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but the changes in Business and First-Class classes were considerably less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, they grew by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
According to the cited study, prices on German domestic flights even fell by half.
One of the reasons for this price drop is slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalized air traffic between the US and Europe.
A sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of unprofitable routes by air carriers, as well as the high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beat Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV reaches the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukaya continues to fail to assemble a working eleven.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - enlarge A failed landing for the representative Marko Marino.
The Gladbach player got into the game late and failed to poke the ball onto the stick.
His message was precisely worded and came out convincingly.
He simply knew she was right.
&quot;We need a second goal,&quot; Hermann Rieger hissed in the corridor to the booths of the Hamburg arena.
There wasn&#39;t much going on in the catacombs, the halftime break was over and most people were back in their seats.
Rieger was HSV&#39;s physical therapist for nearly three decades and is more respected than many a one-time actor.
And so his plea was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and gave a thumbs up in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order probably sounded similar: here with the second goal!
There was no implementation.
&quot;Not everything looked pretty here today,&quot; admitted Marcell Jansen later.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have &quot;wished it was more relaxed&quot;.
For 1:0 (1:0), the Hamburgers owe Mladen Petrić&#39;s header (11th) and the fact that the very weak Gladbasi couldn&#39;t hurt the weak Hamburgers.
&quot;It was a dirty victory,&quot; summed up Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV will celebrate 121 years of existence this Monday.
So on Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the live updated table on the video wall, in which their team was listed as the winner.
It will be a birthday without a proper party.
&quot;We know how to evaluate it,&quot; Marcell Jansen said.
He suspects that the current table result symbolizes the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of his HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petrić and Jansen acquired from FC Bayern - is slowly finding its way, but is still unable to shine.
&quot;We need more feeling and more dribbling,&quot; Jol said emphatically.
My first Oktoberfest
An endlessly repeated pop, beer from thugs and celebrities in costumes from well-known designers.
First time at the beer meadow.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don&#39;t really have much in common.
She is blonde, a TV presenter and wears a tailored suit.
I have dark hair, I&#39;m a student and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing unites us: we haven&#39;t been in the beer meadow for three minutes, and already photographers are rushing at us and quickly filling memory cards - this flatters me, after all, it&#39;s my first time at Oktoberfest.
This is how you can make friends.
My cheap costume seems to have served its purpose.
I&#39;m here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equator, so my sense of comfort in costume was rather limited.
But right after arriving at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone is wearing a woman&#39;s costume or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
Only my apron gets strange looks at the chocolate covered bananas stand.
A Munich woman warns me that I tied her wrong: &quot;On the left you are free, in the middle you are a virgin, on the right you are engaged, in the back you are a widow.&quot;
I covertly flip the bow from behind to the left.
&quot;Okay,&quot; he says, laughing.
Others are less concerned with subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats with the words &quot;To drunk to get dressed!&quot; and they stick out their naked asses at passers-by.
The young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is called Bob, he is from England and he also came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it &quot;gorgeous&quot;, with an extended &quot;ooooo&quot;.
This is what he tells me after he relieves himself of the fat he just drank.
Right next to one of those fire hydrants that everyone thinks are trash cans.
So Bob is one of the dreaded &quot;Wildbieslers&quot;, as they call people who urinate freely in public in Bavaria.
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o&#39;clock in the evening, hordes of medics run around the area where the Oktoberfest takes place, who have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The medics always appear in flocks - in fours carrying a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
They work like most beer meadow visitors: empty there, full back again.
Who lies under the tarpaulin of this drunken coffin cannot be seen.
&quot;Those who can&#39;t go on anymore,&quot; one of the medics calls me in response to my question and disappears into the crowd.
After being defeated in the vote
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
The first news about the sinking of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to drop by as much as 700 points.
This was the largest one-day point loss in its history.
Later, the Dow picked up again.
Around 8:30 p.m., this world&#39;s most important stock market barometer showed a five percent drop to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was down more than seven percent at 1,548 points.
The worst performers in the Dow at this point were American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent, and Bank of America, which lost around twelve percent.
None of the titles could strengthen.
Shares of Goldman Sachs lost almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, the big investor Warren Buffett had a stake in this company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the entire amount should not be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the state is to receive share warrants of financial companies, which could be redeemed if the exchange rate develops favorably, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock prices in Europe are falling sharply
The billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US does not relieve investors of doubts.
The share price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly falling and pulling the Dax index down with it.
The American Dow Jones index loses despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank pulled the German stock index (Dax) deep into the red.
The shares of the mentioned Munich real estate financier lost up to three quarters of their value, despite the rescue action of the federal government and private banks, Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important threshold of 6,000 points and with a minus of 3.7 percent recorded 5,839 points.
All over the world, stock markets went to their knees.
In New York, the trading day on Wall Street started with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government&#39;s $700 billion rescue package might not be enough to revive financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25 points in the first hour of trading.
The US House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate could comment on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also moved in only one direction: in London, the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2 percent, and the CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan&#39;s leading Nikkei index fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 points after early gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng Index fell 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, to trade at 12,595.75.
In MDAx, Arcandor shares lost after the announcement of the capital increase.
Private Bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed 23 million new shares.
The business and tourism concern also announced that it will not sell its stake in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have been puzzled by one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver (gravitational slingshot).
Experts fear that Albert Einstein&#39;s general theory of relativity might not be completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe &quot;Ulysses&quot; flew through space.
Due to the soon-to-freeze fuel lines, she is now in danger of freezing to death.
One mysterious phenomenon has been perplexing scientists for years - the gravitational slingshot anomaly.
Gravitational sling is a flight maneuver of space probes during which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of some space body, for example the Earth.
Thanks to this, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens probe used this physics trick, as did the Ulysses solar probe.
But what scientists have been saying for years in this case is surprising: flying bodies do not behave 100% as one would expect according to the good old law of gravity.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in the speed.
Probes speed up or slow down unexpectedly.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They christened it the gravitational slingshot anomalies.
Several experts fear that even Albert Einstein&#39;s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton remains convinced that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the gravitational slingshot anomaly with the help of the so-called dark matter, the presence of which has been detected by astronomers in the universe.
&quot;Dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth, could be responsible for this anomaly,&quot; he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
Evidently, a gravitational force emanates from it, whose effect on other cosmic bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, it itself is completely invisible, which means that it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not even visible light.
According to scientists&#39; calculations, this dark matter makes up a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt, kidnapped tourists are free
After ten days in the hands of their captors, according to the Italian Foreign Minister, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt are free again.
The kidnappers from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
Six of the kidnappers were said to have been killed in the shootout before the release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the ransom are said to be underway.
Germans repeatedly become the target of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists smuggled into the Sahara are apparently free.
The Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabiya and the Italian media all reported on it.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports from Italian television station Sky TG 24: &quot;Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been freed.
We are currently verifying their health status,&quot; Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian woman, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are safe and sound, according to a report by Egyptian state television.
All 19 participants of the desert expedition are apparently already on their way to Cairo.
The background to the shootout before the release of the hostages remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
&quot;The problem was solved.
They agreed to the ransom,&quot; the quoted worker said.
It was said that &quot;it was just a matter of taking over the hostages,&quot; when suddenly &quot;this surprise&quot; came.
Sudanese soldiers shot dead six kidnappers and captured two of them in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The &quot;El Masri El Jom&quot; newspaper, citing one of the German mediators, said that the release of the hostages is being delayed because the kidnappers fear for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostage after paying a ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Police have released the name of the accident victim
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a car in Essex has been named.
The accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon involved Carole Paulson of Chelmsford Road there.
She was taken to Queen&#39;s Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He was already released on police bail.
Abuse by stepfather &#39;led to suicide&#39;
Years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself, a court heard.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after pleading guilty to eight counts of sexual harassment.
Truro Crown Court heard he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was aged between five and seven.
&quot;I feel responsible for her death,&quot; Trerise wrote in the confession.
The court was also told that Miss Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, aged 34.
When she was living in Coventry as a child, Trerise bound and blindfolded her and then sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court heard that Miss Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was haunted by the specter of abuse, which was perpetrated on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that in 2006 friends of Miss Randle, who was also keen on surfing and cycling, said she was &quot;emotionally dead&quot; and that she had &quot;given up on life&quot;.
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
It is believed that she suffocated herself with a plastic bag.
Randle confronted his daughter&#39;s stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with, &quot;I tied her up and blindfolded her.
&quot;I didn&#39;t abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death.&quot;
Judge Christopher Elwen told Treris: &quot;You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been horrendous for your victim when she was only seven years old.
&quot;This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking her own life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she had not done so, the case would most likely not have gone to court at all.&quot;
&quot;I would especially like to emphasize the consequences that Stephanie&#39;s parents say your crime has had on their daughter over the years,&quot; he added.
&quot;Obviously, she would have otherwise been a promising, successful and happy young woman.&quot;
The official who lost the data will be charged
A government official who left top secret documents on a train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act, the BBC has learned.
The man in question left two top secret documents on a train to Waterloo while on secondment to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents were obtained by the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the least serious offense against the said law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
The BBC&#39;s defense correspondent Frank Gardner said such a move would come as a surprise to many in Whitehall.
&quot;They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the ministry and the Cabinet Office,&quot; he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is charged under Section 8.1 of the Act in question, a clause which deals with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor advised the Metropolitan Police to charge the official on the basis of the highly sensitive nature of his work with the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he had forgotten contained secret analyzes of Al Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from his home to an undisclosed location.
Credit unions face B&amp;B debt
Britain&#39;s credit unions may have to deal with more than £80m of debt after the rescue of Bradford &amp; Bingley.
The Government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million clients at Bradford &amp; Bingley.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that take client deposits, including 59 credit unions.
The chief executive of the Credit Union Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it was &quot;humbling&quot; that credit unions and their members had to pay.
The fourteen billion debt will eventually be paid off by rescuing the Bradford &amp; Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest that accrues in the meantime will be paid every year by all 700 financial firms that take client deposits.
The Money Services Compensation Plan Fund confirmed to the BBC that all 59 credit unions are included in this figure.
It is humiliating that these institutions that acted prudently... now have to pay some of the bills of those institutions that were not nearly as prudent
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each firm should pay in proportion to the deposits it held, and that the pawnshops should pay about 18% of the price.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the debt will rise to £450m in 2009.
This means that the pawnshops will need to find £81m to repay the first year&#39;s interest.
Adrian Coles, chief executive of the trade association of credit unions, told the BBC he believed it was unfair.
&quot;It&#39;s humiliating that those institutions that were prudent during the housing boom now have to pay some of the bills of those institutions that weren&#39;t nearly as prudent.&quot;
According to the BSA, no pawn shop has failed since 1945, when they appeared.
&quot;We will have to examine all aspects of this matter over the next several weeks to see what the options are to protect the credit unions and their members from what could be a substantial bill,&quot; Cole added.
The interest payable in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, there will be a full year&#39;s worth of interest to pay, and that could be almost twice as much.
Since credit unions are cooperative organizations without shareholders, this bill will ultimately be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Turkey&#39;s diplomatic horizons are expanding
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into Turkish territory.
On the eastern shore of the Bosphorus, perhaps only twenty paces in Asia, stands one of the finest monuments of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpaša railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in the Neo-Renaissance style.
That is what the tourist guides will tell you.
The building sits astride the end of the platforms with a tower at each corner of the facade, looking indistinguishable from some provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole structure is slowly falling apart.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, one can no longer doubt the size of the enterprise whose westernmost gateway the station was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a late entrant to the game of empires, intended to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East with the help of this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond to what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany&#39;s imperial ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular troops.
The relative isolation from surrounding territories created by the frozen borders of the Cold War is gone
British and colonial troops advanced from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was also bad news for Hydarpaša station.
In 1917, an ammunition train explosion destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has gradually crumbled and history has bypassed it.
Today, however, this gateway to Anatolia and further east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - AKP - created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from surrounding territories created by the frozen borders of the Cold War is gone.
Now a new policy is being implemented - Turkey is getting involved.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I boarded a night train to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to meet with one of the AKP&#39;s leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a bumpy ride on tracks that recalled the old-world rhythms of the famous documentary Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
She aroused suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi brought me to the AKP&#39;s main tent, an ultra-modern stone and metal building, purpose-built in a burgeoning suburb, surrounded by half-built department stores and powerhouses, where business-suited middle managers - both men and women - meet to do early morning deals. .
Suat Kiniklioglu could easily be a center-right politician from almost any other European political party.
Jacket, tie, I&#39;m sure he had a Blackberry too.
&quot;The goal of the party&#39;s foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate surroundings.
The Cold War was an anomaly,&quot; he told me.
Turkey was cut off from its borders.
Today they have to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn&#39;t a choice.
It had to do both.
&quot;But surely there will come a time,&quot; I asked, &quot;when Turkey may have to make up her mind?&quot;
&quot;Turkey&quot;, he said, &quot;did not wish that such a decision had to take place.&quot;
He then emphasized what almost everyone I spoke to here said almost by heart: Turkey&#39;s relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea region are as much to the benefit of Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, ride eastward on these tracks to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpaša station, after another mostly awake night, I thought of those two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Cona, who watched this building being built a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be to learn that Europe&#39;s ambitions in the Middle East may now be, for the most part, in Turkish hands.
And as I waited at the port for the ferry back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot;.
So it seems that, at least then, there was little doubt as to which continent should lay claim to this fascinating land.
Milk will go up five pence a litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
A Jersey dairy has announced it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per liter from Monday.
It is the second price rise this year, following a twopence increase in February, and comes after research by the consultancy.
Retailers have to decide for themselves if they want to reflect the increase in customer prices.
Before February&#39;s increase, the wholesale Jersey milk price last changed in 2002.
Bail for former Bangladeshi prime minister denied
A Bangladeshi court has rejected former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajid&#39;s bail application, meaning she could be arrested if she returns to her homeland.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail over allegations that she extorted more than fifty million taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several corruption charges leveled against her.
Khalida Zija, a longtime political rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the local military-held government first give her full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was released on her recognizance to undergo medical treatment abroad, the terms of her release make it unclear whether she will remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal the High Court order to the Supreme Court.
&quot;The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina&#39;s application for bail, saying that she does not need bail when she is already undergoing examinations abroad on affidavit,&quot; said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
&quot;We are appealing against the High Court order.&quot;
Her lawyers argued that she needed bail to allow her to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
A senior official of the People&#39;s League said that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after the military-held interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khalida Zija both deny all the accusations brought against them.
Polio vaccination scare in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children did not participate in the recent widespread polio vaccination because of Taliban-linked violence.
The UN carried out vaccinations in six provinces last week.
However, she says she has been unable to reach children in the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar due to security concerns.
A UN spokesman said this happened despite the Taliban&#39;s promises not to attack or prevent thousands of vaccination workers from working.
BSkyB loses court case over ITV
BSkyB has lost a legal battle to review a Competition Commission decision ordering the firm to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster ITV.
BSkyB was ordered by the Competition Appeal Tribunal to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
The commission previously said that BSkyB&#39;s stake was preventing competition and giving the company disproportionate influence over ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in a deal that ultimately prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading announced that BSkyB&#39;s acquisition of a stake in ITV raised doubts about ITV&#39;s independence and called on the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Virgin consortium boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer organizations and regulator Ofcom all opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its stake in ITV was unreasonable and disproportionate as a solution - mainly because BSkyB had previously said it was willing to give up its voting rights.
A new investigation into the US attorney affair
The U.S. attorney general has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The move came as a Justice Department inspector general&#39;s report on the affair criticized the actions of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, a lawmaker and former Justice Secretary Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by concerns that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials questioned during the probe lied to investigators in order to obstruct justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said in the report: &quot;Serious allegations, including potential criminal conduct, have not been fully investigated or explained.&quot;
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the US Department of Justice removed nine US attorneys from their positions in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry said the lawyers had been dismissed for poor performance.
However, it later emerged that the dismissed lawyers were rated no worse than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissals were politically motivated.
Some of the attorneys were involved in prosecuting high-ranking Republican lawmakers and senators, while others refused to investigate voter fraud allegations leveled against Democrats.
U.S. attorneys investigate and prosecute court cases for the government.
They may be fired at any time, but may not be removed for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice at the time, Secretary Alberto Gonzales, came under fire for the firings and eventually resigned.
A number of other Justice Department officials also resigned.
The inspector general&#39;s report was highly critical of Gonzales&#39; role in the affair, saying he bore &quot;primary responsibility&quot; for the firings, that he &quot;abdicated&quot; his leadership position and was &quot;remarkably disengaged.&quot;
Other officials, including former senior Bush adviser Karl Rove, have been criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf&#39;s masterpiece will be honored
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will attend a ceremony in London next weekend for his special gold award, said he was &quot;honoured&quot; by the recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf&#39;s 1977 hit album.
This year&#39;s nominations are led by Coldplay, who were shortlisted in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q Magazine, said: &quot;There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely one of them.&quot;
Written by Jim Steinman, the song needed big vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and peaked at number fifteen.
But Meat Loaf&#39;s Bat Out Of Hell album stayed in the charts for about nine years and sold more than forty million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including surgery in 2003 for an irregular heart rhythm after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
It later turned out that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
An obscure street, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other roads, some famous, others only utilitarian.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and longtime locals have trouble finding Extra Place, mostly because they&#39;ve never heard of it.
This tiny alley is in the East Village and runs north from First Street - without going to Second Street - between the Bowery and Second Avenue.
With a width of about ten meters and a length of forty meters, it is more like a dusty passage than a traffic lane.
There are no street name signs.
It is practically invisible in a regular atlas.
Nevertheless, the alley has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants to repave Extra Place and create a cleaner passage to the shops and boutiques that are to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who say they were charmed by the shortened lane simply because it was one of the last holdovers from before the block was gentrified.
However, the city&#39;s Office for the Protection and Development of Buildings, which has the street in its power, has not the slightest interest in sticking to it.
At a meeting of the community&#39;s land committee, representatives of the municipal authority and the company Avalon Bay outlined a plan according to which the developer should buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, District Manager of Community 3, the committee prefers an option where the street remains in the city&#39;s hands, and has requested a new plan that should be submitted next month.
&quot;The city already owns very little land, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its ownership,&quot; she said.
&quot;Proposals could be made for repair and management, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility.&quot;
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wanted to repave the small street and add seating, some of which would be used by a cafe, which the developer expects to be interested in leasing the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first floated at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to use the street, it doesn&#39;t necessarily want to own it.
&quot;Avalon Bay&#39;s main intention is to fix this run-down lane and make it a beautiful place for the public,&quot; she said, adding that the sale was proposed by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation Office, said the city did want to sell the street, noting that his office&#39;s job is to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow mark on history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802 when Philip Minthorn&#39;s large farm was divided among several of his children and the narrow strip of land was unclaimed.
The back door of CBGB, a punk rock landmark that closed in 2006, led to Extra Place, and the alley is perhaps best known as the backdrop to the photo on the cover of the Ramones&#39; &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot; album.
&quot;The place was amazing,&quot; says Ramones manager Danny Fields, who took the photo in November 1976.
&quot;It was full of rubbish, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.&quot;
Some locals, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the piece of public property, however meager, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - an almost unchanged piece of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah&#39;s Disappearing New York (subtitled &quot;The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Dying&quot;), posted part of a story about Extra Place from the Let&#39;s Talk About the City column that appeared in The New Yorker in in 1952.
The article&#39;s author, Brendan Gill, wrote: &quot;Extra Place is a narrow cul-de-sac, dark even by day and bordered by rusty iron warehouse doors and boarded-up windows, where week-old newspapers are flung in gutters.&quot;
With a few exceptions, the alley looked exactly the same on a recent evening.
The rat ran across the dead end of the street near the door that once led to CBGB&#39;s, where an expensive clothing store now stands.
There was graffiti on the walls, and an empty beer bottle lay next to a fresh batch of discarded newspapers.
A couple of passers-by said he rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested he could use a boost.
In contrast, Fields said he thinks some people underestimate the appeal of the alley in its current state.
&quot;The best years of my life,&quot; he said, &quot;were in dark, damp, and foul places.&quot;
The Bilingualism Debate: English Immersion
In this edition of Focus on Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the candidates&#39; positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a Californian scholar and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of &quot;Worse Than You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice.&quot;
Reaching Hispanic voters effectively is a tricky business.
Barack Obama&#39;s education agenda only proves it.
The Obama campaign notes that &quot;African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,&quot; which is true.
To combat such performance gaps, Obama&#39;s education agenda specifically promotes, among other things, &quot;transitional bilingual education&quot; for English learners.
The question for Barack Obama, however, remains whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is stronger than his interest in narrowing the achievement gap.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in East Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are, in the vast majority of cases, Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are still learning English.
Even so, in the state mathematics tests in 2008, an incredible one hundred percent of fourth graders reached the highest level.
An almost equally amazing ninety-three percent of fourth graders scored at the highest level on the state&#39;s English Language Arts and Literature tests.
This incredible achievement was achieved by a different method than the one preferred by Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of ability, and a no-excuses approach.
Also, and something Obama should take note of, according to Sixth Street principal Linda Mikels, the school&#39;s pedagogic approach for English learners is &quot;total immersion.&quot;
English immersion emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in teaching.
Miss Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me: &quot;We&#39;ve had tremendous success with one brand new pupil from Mexico - after twelve months you&#39;d walk into the classroom and not know which one it is.&quot;
&quot;It works,&quot; she declared, &quot;it works for us.&quot;
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for what other schools with large proportions of Hispanic and English learners should look like?
The school&#39;s track record should make the answer to that question a foregone conclusion, but his own party&#39;s education agenda (the National Education Association is a longtime supporter of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education make it difficult to predict Obama&#39;s answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue when he said people should stop worrying about &quot;English-only&quot; laws.
Instead, &quot;you should make sure your kids speak Spanish,&quot; he said.
If Obama truly wishes to close the achievement gap, he should think carefully about the educational models that work, rather than mocking and trivializing them.
Oil falls sharply on renewed economic concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday on fears that even the US plan to save financial markets might not revive the economy.
Oil futures fell as much as 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Since last Monday, prices have fallen by more than twenty dollars per barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by financial turmoil on Wall Street as well as a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After hitting a high of $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month before rebounding on a wave of tremendous financial market uncertainty.
Anxiety gripped investors again on Monday, even after congressional bureaus said they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the biggest bailout plan in history.
The news was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the ongoing unraveling, the government announced that Citigroup will buy the banking division of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the frantic weekend negotiations that led to the rescue plan &quot;are proving unable to revive market sentiment&quot;.
As the economic situation worsens, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to fall.
&quot;The outlook for global equity markets, interest rates and currency rates has become highly uncertain,&quot; analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to investors.
&quot;We believe that commodities will not be able to escape the contagion.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is the extent to which the US virus will spread globally and especially to China.&quot;
Analysts at the bank trimmed their expectations for next year as oil consumption fell due to slower economic growth, and cut their 2009 gasoline price forecasts by about 20%.
The wild second-quarter drive broke a team record
After spending more time with the Jets than anyone else over the last eight seasons, defensive end Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then on Sunday, he watched the second quarter unfold, in which the Jets turned a scoreless game into a dream run.
&quot;I&#39;ve never seen anything like it,&quot; Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals dealt with the gloomy clouds with their troubled play.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranuese Coles on a 12-yard touchdown run, perfectly foreshadowing an afternoon in which their burgeoning partnership took a mile.
Favre threw Coles for two more touchdowns in the quarter, including a fumble by the cornerback and another with 10 seconds left in the half.
&quot;It was nothing out of the ordinary,&quot; Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
&quot;He&#39;s a damn good player.
We communicated very well, whatever people think.&quot;
While Favre and Coles were throwing, the defense was attacking Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis intercepted the fumble and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith picked off another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to fumble.
The final turnover, a fumble forced by Bowens, was perhaps the best ever.
The Cardinals got the ball with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal for a 34-0 lead.
That&#39;s the most the Jets have ever scored in one quarter.
Asked to describe the madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, &quot;Second quarter or third quarter?&quot;
When told that both -- the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter -- Mangini said, &quot;I can tell you I enjoyed the second quarter a lot more than the third quarter.
A lot of points fell in a short period of time.&quot;
A rested Gebreselassie improved his world record
Ethiopia&#39;s Haile Gebreselassie showed again why many consider him the greatest distance runner ever when he broke his own world record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first person to run the 26.2-mile race in under two hours and four minutes.
Winning on the pleasantly flat course in 2:03:59, he beat his previous time of 2:04:26, which he ran in Berlin last year, by 27 seconds.
Gebreselassie, 35, set the 26th world record of a career that is truly incredibly broad - he has broken the world record or is at least the world champion at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie skipped the Olympic marathon in Beijing because he feared - in retrospect perhaps too much - that the polluted air would aggravate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In near-perfect conditions — sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish — Gebreselassie won Sunday with a blistering average of 4 minutes, 43 seconds per mile.
As track runners such as Gebreselassie and Kenya&#39;s Paul Tergat have focused on longer distances, the marathon record has dropped more than two minutes in the past decade since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday&#39;s win, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had calf cramps two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
The break evidently stimulated him rather than delayed him.
&quot;I am so happy,&quot; Gebreselassie told reporters.
&quot;Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was a bit doubtful today, but everything was fine.&quot;
He has also been criticized - mainly in Kenya, Ethiopia&#39;s East African rival - for allegedly over-planning his races, generally avoiding the world&#39;s top marathoners, relying on conductors as if it were a track race and setting world records over a sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly diminish Gebreselassie&#39;s immense running qualities.
Kept on pace by four Kenyans, Gebreselassie reached the halfway point in 1:02:04.
After the drivers dropped out, Gebreselassie was constantly chased by two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
With just over three miles to go, Gebreselassie made a final grab and run away from Kwambai, who went on to finish second in 2:05:36, bettering his personal best by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women&#39;s race, Irina Mikitenkova, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a citizen of Germany, rounded off an excellent year with the seventh fastest time in history, 2:19:19.
The record time of 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain.
Thirty-six-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won the London Marathon last spring in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games with what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin, bettering her personal best by almost five minutes in the third marathon she has ever run.
She ran the race smartly and thoughtfully: she let a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners out to a large lead, then caught them after about 18 ½ miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
The pride and obstacles of black life in a segregated city
Tucked away among the sprawling theme parks of greater Orlando, a few miles from all the glitz, glitz and glam, lies a quiet town where the pride and grit of African-American life comes alive.
Eatonville, the first all-black town to be incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: &quot;a town of five lakes, three croquet courts, three hundred brownskins, three hundred good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison.&quot;
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to Eatonville&#39;s annual Zora! festival to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The town she described remains sidelined, even as she made it a tourist stop by including it in a Depression-era Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers Project.
It is still as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true feelings with the white man who &quot;knows so little about us that he doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s missing.&quot; .&quot;
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Sen. Barack Obama, is calling for an open discussion about race, many residents here remain wary of the views of outsiders.
&quot;We are very careful about how our story is told,&quot; says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the city&#39;s oldest parish.
“It has to be right.
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and toil.
It is both a historic model of Black Ascension and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is double the national average.
It is a center of literature, but also an oak-shaded example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes celebrated - that arose out of American slavery.
It&#39;s not too surprising that the people here are both proud and protective.
And the worry about the idea of Eatonville really started with Zora, which is the only way the Hurstons are called here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heartfelt, dialect-filled books like &quot;Mules and Men&quot; (1935) and &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; (1937).
Five paragraphs from a Florida tourist guide turned the town just off Route 17, which runs through the often-overlooked center of Florida, into a stage for black history and human drama.
With the beat of a big drum in life and in literature, Hurston takes the reader into the shop of Eatonville&#39;s first mayor, Joe Clark, and then turns to more personal places.
&quot;On the left by the road,&quot; she wrote, &quot;is a white, brown-trimmed, modern national school with well-kept grounds and playing fields, always attended to by Howard Miller, even though he can&#39;t read or write much.&quot;
She also mentioned Widow Dash&#39;s new husband, writing that Lee Glenn &quot;sells all kinds of drinks and anything else that fits in an hour hotel.&quot;
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
This was clearly not a typical Fodor&#39;s publishing house.
It wasn&#39;t really a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
&quot;Zora told it like it was,&quot; says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson&#39;s choir of girls who immortalized Hurston by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
&quot;Some people didn&#39;t like it,&quot; she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a vivacious eccentric who returned often after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin recalls that most of the time, when she rushed into town, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still prides itself on dressing decently.
Most residents were fascinated, Franklin said, but many scoffed.
&quot;People have always loved seeing Zoro,&quot; Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging in a chair on the back patio overlooking Sabelia Lake, where Hurston was most likely baptized, &quot;she never stayed very long.&quot;
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her along with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no major funerals or large public readings in Eatonville.
&quot;I don&#39;t think they understood her significance to the world or her legacy at all,&quot; said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston&#39;s 2003 biography, &quot;Wrapped in Rainbows.&quot;
Change came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted a five-lane freeway through the city instead of Kennedy Boulevard, the local two-lane thoroughfare.
Orlando&#39;s sprawl has already pushed Interstate 4 through the city&#39;s western edge.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, among other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the race-mixing battle brought hatred to the doorstep of the community.
&quot;At that time, a bunch of white guys, they came in and threw oranges and stuff at people sitting on the sidelines,&quot; Franklin said.
“We actually had a lady here that was killed by it.
They threw a watermelon from the car.&quot;
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston challenged the Supreme Court&#39;s demand for forced integration, calling its ruling in Brown v. Board of Education &quot;more offensive than glorifying to my race.&quot;
Residents now say that school desegregation, while positive in some areas, has reduced Eatonville&#39;s cohesion and undermined the courage of its youth.
&quot;Black kids were used to hugs — I remember that — you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher at night,&quot; said NY Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
That lasted as long as the teachers and students came from the same place, she added.
&quot;You don&#39;t hug your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean there&#39;s a cultural barrier,&quot; Miss Nathiri said.
Nevertheless, civil rights helped make room for many more Zora Neale Hurstons—black writers, actors, and artists who, like her, rose above prejudice with reckless self-confidence and quotes like, &quot;How can anyone deny me the pleasure of my presence!
I don&#39;t understand that.&quot;
In 1975, Alice Walker traveled to Hurston&#39;s unmarked grave and began fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, Robert E. Hemenway&#39;s much-lauded biography of Hurston hit bookstore shelves, reinstating her in the American canon.
The freeway project arrived just as Eatonville&#39;s most famous daughter found the lights on the ramps again.
The Hurstons&#39; former neighbors now saw her as a savior.
To show what could happen to their freeway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans turned out for the inaugural event two years later, and every January many return to celebrate.
After several years, the state backed away from the highway proposal.
&quot;The five streams of the freeway rekindled, you would say it directly detonated, real civic pride,&quot; Nathiri said.
Boyd put it more simply, &quot;Zora saved Eatonville.&quot;
The victory over the highway project helped change the city&#39;s image.
Out-of-towners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began attending the local church in 1993, began to show up in greater numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historic Register in 1998.
A new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a repaved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes seem like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today it is 90 percent black.)
Strangers who come in search of the story and meaning of Eatonville are still often treated with caution.
Permission must be obtained for most interviews in advance, and certain things - such as the murals in Eatonville&#39;s oldest church, painted by whites and depicting blacks in the fields - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a bold, confident teacher who likes deep red, still worry that their isolated community will be misunderstood.
And even as the Hurston festival grew, so did home pride.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, troubled and all, but no better, no worse, and just as proud, creative, hardworking, foolish, and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
Franklin&#39;s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, exudes genuine love for the community as he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in local government or on the police force, which he says could use some help.
And even the younger ones, like 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
&quot;Most people, when they just drive through here, they think, &#39;Hm, this town is nothing against the others,&#39; &quot; Alondra Kenon said after church on a recent Sunday.
&quot;But if you really stop and look at the history for a moment, it&#39;s a very nice town.&quot;
Here in New York, we&#39;re all financially fluent
At first glance, nothing has changed here.
If Manhattan tourists stayed away from the newsstands and giant television screens in Times Square, they wouldn&#39;t realize they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never guess that in the glass beehive of offices above their heads, every day the bankers and investment fund managers who monopolize New York are having their worst &quot;bad day at the office&quot; since the Great Depression of 1929.
Delivery men still rattle metal carts down the sidewalks, carrying muffin tins to breakfast meetings.
The Hispanics still move between the towers, carrying, like human mules, fifty ironed shirts that hang from rockers on their backs.
Office rats are still queuing for their morning bagel at street food stalls, and it&#39;s still impossible to get a yellow cab on a weekday between four and seven in the afternoon.
It didn&#39;t seem like a crisis at all until, with all the talk of pessimism, I decided to open a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I timed this task to coincide with a late afternoon siesta at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about twenty people waiting in line.
Not in front of teller windows to withdraw or deposit cash, but in front of the counter where older customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to Macy&#39;s, and new customers open accounts.
Most of the people before me, I learned from Starr, my &quot;licensed personal banker,&quot; came for the same reason I did.
However, unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in the places they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, or Staten Island.
They took money from so-called thrifts (somewhat similar to building societies), money associations, and those types of savings banks that operate in only one state and that claim to treat their customers like family.
In the past year, 15 such banks quietly went bankrupt.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, filed for bankruptcy, and as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in assets, was scrambling to hunt down a rescue buyer.
The office and retail workers standing in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their cash to a bank that is seen as a safe haven and that does most of the bailing out on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned financial fluency over the past week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket was on the phone talking about Lehman Borthers, that failed bank, and its emaciated chief executive, Dick Fuld, with the familiarity of picking on a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed 50-year-old housekeeper of my apartment building, changed the subject of our usual conversation to Brad, Angelina, or my grocery delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, &quot;I now have my savings in money market funds.
I&#39;ve moved it, I&#39;m not going to risk it.&quot;
Memorable Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford&#39;s music director since 1962, Vernon &quot;Tod&quot; Handley (obituary, September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus.
As part of the district&#39;s music plan, he founded the excellent youth choir Proteus the following year.
He was supposed to be under 21, but by the time Proteus sang for the last time in 1979, a few of us were almost 30 - we just refused to give up on that choir.
The name &quot;Proteus&quot; (a mythological shape-shifter) represented the choir&#39;s willingness and ability to tackle whatever music was presented to them - be it madrigals or Messiaen, whether alone or with a full orchestra.
The musical adaptability produced by such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, all thanks to the inspiration of this one man and a passion for music that remained absolutely unchanged throughout.
How often has Tod told us to &quot;let the music speak for itself&quot;.
He said: &quot;The composer knows what he wants.
It&#39;s all in that music.
So sing it! &quot;
His bar technique was absolutely clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor flowery.
Wherever the musical standard was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor was to be knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
I&#39;ve reviewed over 100 of his concerts over the past 40 years or so, and I can honestly say that I&#39;ve never been disappointed by any of them - and many times I&#39;ve been inspired.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply &quot;dragged one or two soaked balls around the world&quot;.
He will be missed by many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (September 25) states that he &quot;returned to economic history at Oxford in 1946 and became a researcher at Houblon-Norman in 1950... while also studying for a BSc, MA and PhD&quot;.
This is based on Woodruff&#39;s author&#39;s note in Beyond Nab End, but it&#39;s not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a dissertation on the British rubber industry supervised by Professor JD Chambers, which he subsequently published in 1958 as the publication British Rubber Industry.
Indeed, he spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for good and moved to Illinois.
It is unknown why Woodruff skipped this part of his career.
Muslim graves desecrated after Austrian right-wing break
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, of the Austrian right-wing Free Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang party take part in a demonstration presented by the &quot;Cities Against Islamization&quot; organization in Antwerp on Thursday January 17, 2008.
They carry road sign-like signs that show mosques crossed out with a red line.
Police are accusing right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend that far-right parties made huge gains in the general election.
Over 90 graves at a cemetery in the town of Traun, near Linz, were heavily vandalized sometime between Friday evening and this morning, in what police believe was an organized act.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the Star of David on some of the graves, but detectives believe this may have been an attempt to mask the motives of extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether this incident was in any way connected to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were &quot;deeply shocked&quot; by reports of the desecration, which comes as the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan draws to a close.
Austria, meanwhile, is entering a round of soul-searching after swinging to the right in yesterday&#39;s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, which together won more than 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, campaigned vehemently against immigration and some of their slogans were condemned as xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the Free Party, which won over 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to foods perceived to be associated with Islam.
At the last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of &quot;European brotherhood&quot; to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides seek to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analysis conducted immediately after the election, which put the far right in the position of the strongest political bloc in the country, suggest that the change was mainly caused by young voters who worry about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel abroad
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned by a court from traveling to France and Spain.
Officials imposed the six-month ban on Glitter after he informed monitoring authorities that he planned to travel to Spain via France.
Kent Police was granted the travel ban last Thursday after handing officers evidence of Glitter&#39;s past convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Crown Court in Kent but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the justice service said: &quot;On Thursday 25 September at Ashford Criminal Court, Kent Police applied for an order preventing Mr Paul Gadd from crossing the border into France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally involved.&quot;
The 64-year-old Glitter informed authorities that he wished to travel abroad, as required by his record on the sex offender registry.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They must also give the planned departure date to the police a week in advance.
If he neglected to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent Police said it would not be dealing with individual cases of Glitter&#39;s possible travels around the county.
A spokeswoman for Kent Police said: &quot;Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our perspective, it is easier to track someone who remains in Britain because we have extensive systems here to manage potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting the people of Kent is a top priority for Kent Police and we work closely to monitor the behavior of recorded sex offenders to minimize any danger to the public.&quot;
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok to catch a flight to London.
But he said he was not feeling well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him go through passport control and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to Britain.
He eventually arrived at Heathrow&#39;s Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his solicitor David Corker went to Uxbridge Magistrates&#39; Court in West London, while Scotland Yard successfully sought an order requiring him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter was previously jailed for four months in the UK for possessing child pornography.
A Home Office source said Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was relieved and pleased Glitter had been prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
“To capture the true character, I photograph the master offstage. Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no frills or costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, detached from concentration on interpretation - that&#39;s the only way I can achieve a relaxed expression of a man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the second - a person.
Inseparable, if we leave aside privacy, in those moments far from the audience - then one can see a confidential gesture, the depth of a fleeting glance or a passionate gesticulation of hands that are carefree because they are not going to take the stage.
In &quot;Flamenco-people&quot; the German Günther Bauer alternates the theatricality of performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with the lesser-known face of the masters.
With this intention, the photographer compiles a unique flamenco iconography from various environments.
The exhibition, which takes place as part of the program of the Month of Flamenco Photography (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca), &quot;reflects the ever-increasing international importance of flamenco&quot;, says the author, explaining that &quot;Flamenco-people&quot; &quot;can be any people, but if you look at the photographs , you will find that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed &quot;on the street&quot; are artists capable of transferring passion, sadness, joy... and completely captivating the audience.
It is not necessary to take pictures on stage to capture the personality of these artists.
They carry their personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the flamenco greats.
Fascinated by the &quot;Cante de las Minas&quot; festival, in 1997 Bauer began a long journey of portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on a plate camera.
They are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble classic photography.
The use of different stylistic devices contradicts the classical basis of the film and lends it a contemporary spirit, an idea that, according to Bauer himself, is also mirrored by flamenco: &quot;Music with very traditional roots, but which never ceases to surprise and evolve.&quot;
What captivates the audience is not the action of the dance, song or play itself, but the personality and character of the performer.
The search for the moment when we meet the most essential, with that spirit that manifests itself in the way of perception, being and experiencing, that was and is the constant of the work presented during these days in the El Fotómata gallery.
This selection of almost seventy photographed artists is made up of well-known flamenco figures, such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyosová, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenco and will soon see a book edition, which will include the exhibited portraits.
The passion for portraiture led Bauer two years ago to the idea of repeating the idea on &quot;Portraits of sports veterans&quot; (&quot;SportARTproject&quot;).
Although their concept is different from &quot;Flamenco-people&quot;, the photographer admits that &quot;photographing people, getting to know them and having the opportunity to enter their lives for a moment, whether long or short - that&#39;s my passion.
I think portraiture is the most difficult genre in photography.
One meets or encounters people, personalities that one does not even know at times, or they only give him a few minutes to take photos.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer I always try to realize my ideas.&quot;
A collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco called &quot;Flamenco-people&quot; is exhibited at El Fotómata Gallery at 20 de la Mata street, parallel to Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until October 16.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel he is writing is a &quot;dare&quot;
It takes place in an environment he does not yet know and tells about events unknown to him, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement his new project - he is currently working on a novel whose main character is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and he also traveled in the Amazon.
The perennial favorite for the Nobel Prize for Literature admitted yesterday at Segovia&#39;s Hay Festival that the project he is currently working on &quot;is an audacity&quot; and that &quot;everything indicates that I shouldn&#39;t be writing&quot; the novel.
&quot;If I had sense, I wouldn&#39;t do it, but I will do it and I believe I will finish it one day,&quot; he concluded his contribution at the festival of the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words, which during four days saw around a hundred writers, historians and journalists in the city of Aqueduct and thousands of other people.
The author of the novel &quot;City and Dogs&quot; was one of the main characters of the third year of the Word Festival and he lived up to expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize for the most popular writer - an old edition of Dickens&#39; &quot;Our mutual friend&quot; - filled the Juan Bravo Theater to capacity.
With Félix Romeo introducing him, he had a dedicated audience in front of him, for whom an hour of time flew by like water - the Peruvian recalled with amazing accuracy and a considerable dose of humor how in him from the original &quot;incredible adventure&quot; to &quot;the pleasure of an avid reader&quot; and &quot;to be able to live more than I lived&quot; gave birth to a literary mission; how he makes up for the &quot;lack of inspiration&quot; by writing &quot;disciplinedly&quot;, carefully collecting the text, correcting and rewriting; or how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his writing and what &quot;memory images&quot; are the supporting basis of his stories.
The Hispanic-American novelist admitted that &quot;there is no way&quot; to find out if and to what extent books can change a life, &quot;but I refuse to believe that literature is just entertainment, a fleeting experience&quot; - emphasized Vargas Llosa, saying that, according to him, &quot;on people acts&quot; and &quot;makes them try to get out of line&quot;, and urged writers to &quot;not be frivolous&quot; and &quot;take responsibility&quot; for their mission.
Due to climatology, he loses the celebration in Pozoblanco - spears are missing
The javelin performance that closes the Pozoblanco festivities was canceled yesterday morning after the performers&#39; announcement that the square&#39;s surface was not in good condition was confirmed.
Therefore, the company together with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández decided to cancel the bullfights.
Unfavorable meteorological conditions have plagued this celebration for a long time, two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday, rain prevented the course of the second scheduled bullfights.
During them, the formation of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista was supposed to face the bulls in the bullring in Castilblanca.
But it was only celebrated like this on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and was carried on his shoulders as a reward for a dynamic and aesthetically quality performance.
That same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two javelins for salutes and one ear, brought more by the bare seats of the arena than by the art of toreador.
Even worse was El Juli, who walked through the Los Llanos bullring unsalted and fat.
In the second round of hard work without a single break, he earned sharp criticism from the majority of the audience.
They escaped inspection in Álava in a van with two thousand kilograms of hashish
Five in ten minutes.
Ertzaintza road inspection in the municipality of Armiñón (Álava).
Officers stop two people driving in a van and they run away.
The load, more than two tons of hashish, is unstoppable.
According to a report from the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government, officers chased them and arrested one of the people riding in the van, a 38-year-old man identified as AAJ
The detainee was accused of drug smuggling and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Traffic Unit were conducting a road inspection on the N-1 at the points where it crosses the border of the municipal district of Armiñón.
They were about to stop the van for inspection, but the driver disobeyed instructions, sped up and sped off.
The officers immediately began chasing the car until the vehicle stopped at the roadside a few kilometers away, at which point both passengers jumped out and ran into the forest.
The members of Ertzaintza finally caught up with one of them and seized 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects were transporting, as was revealed during the inspection of the Iveco Daily van.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with packages of hashish, which were then transported to other police departments for detailed expertise and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the police found that the license plate is &quot;wrinkled&quot; and does not agree with the data given in the delivery documents, therefore the detainee was also accused of falsifying state documents.
The Ertzaintza continues to search for the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drug.
The arrested AAJ, 28, has been taken to the police department for proper formalities before further investigation will proceed later.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, popular Amanda from Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her make unusual maneuvers as she tried to pull out of a parking lot in Montecito, a spokesperson for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
The witness specified that around 4:30 p.m., Locklear &quot;stepped hard on the gas, drove forward and backward with a loud crash and tried to get out of the parking space - while backing up, she ran over her sunglasses several times.&quot;
A witness, who did not appear to recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear moments later pull over on a nearby freeway and get out of her vehicle.
That person also called emergency services because she &quot;feared for Locklear&#39;s life.&quot;
When a police patrol arrived at the scene, they found the actress inside a vehicle that partially blocked the road.
She &quot;appeared disoriented,&quot; so officers took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center for testing.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress cooperated and an excessive amount of alcohol was immediately ruled out, however &quot;we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medication, which was apparent to the officers at first glance&quot;.
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 7pm, although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic where she was recovering from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian IU association to exercise its powers in the Silva case
The general head of the IU and MP for the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that the final decision in the case of the former councilor of the Department of Youth and Sport of the City Hall of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned from office last week after being accused of acting in favor of his family, will be depend on the party&#39;s regional association.
&quot;I&#39;m too federalist for that, it&#39;s up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers,&quot; Llamazares hinted at the negotiations the party will have to take in relation to the former member of Seville&#39;s city council.
However, the IU boss insisted that &quot;transparency&quot; is absolutely necessary in the case of an investigation into the illegal conduct Silva committed: &quot;IU has always fought for such matters to be as transparent as possible.&quot;
He also emphasized that the party has a &quot;strict code of ethics for all public functions&quot;.
&quot;Blood of May&quot; (&#39;Sangre de mayo&#39;), Garci&#39;s epic bet
José Luis Garci, in the film &quot;May blood&quot; (Sangre de mayo), for which he was inspired by Episodes from the national past of Benito Pérez Galdós, revives the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French - this is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to &quot;portray the eloquence of the characters and the analysis of society&quot; that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today together with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría during the presentation of the film in front of a large team of interpreters.
With a length of over two and a half hours, the May Blood will be released in cinemas this Friday, and in the future a series of more than four hours is planned for Telemadrid television.
As a great admirer of Galdós&#39;s literary work, José Luis Garci claims that by making this film he fulfilled a &quot;childhood dream&quot;, for which he owes Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago for the Autonomous Province of Madrid to make a film for the bicentenary of Madrid&#39;s May 2nd, he offered he accepted, saying that the plot would be based on Episodes of the National Past.
The budget of 15 million, which was completely contributed by the province of Madrid, means for Garci a &quot;unique opportunity&quot; to create an environment with sets and costumes corresponding to the image of &quot;a bursting Spain that has mistaken the leader to fight for - the struggle for independence led during the reign of Ferdinand VII. to the decline and backwardness of the country,&quot; he said.
However, the director regrets that he cannot count on the financial support received by the films Ala triste or Goya&#39;s ghosts - almost twice as much as Blood of May - so he could not shoot some scenes from the script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has been working almost his entire career film career.
The director of the film &quot;Volver a empezar&quot; (Volver a empezar) works as he is usually used to - on the scene together with actors with whom he usually rehearses before shooting and which he does not choose by casting, because he finds it &quot;humiliating&quot; and also believes that &quot;part of the director&#39;s profession is, among other things, to go to theaters and cinemas and thus find out what is happening in the craft he deals with&quot;.
Many of the actors he chose for Blood of May appear in front of his camera several times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, with four Oscar nominations, one of which he won, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain before the Hollywood Academy this year, Blood of May alone, Seven Tables of French Billiards and the last selected Blind Sunflower, represent the young generation of the Spanish film scene, but he claims that &quot;she is yet to appear&quot;.
Garcia does not expect any awards for this film.
&quot;At first you think you&#39;re working for what&#39;s next, but then you realize you&#39;re only working to make money, so you give in to make one more film,&quot; explains Garci, who has more than 30 years of directing career.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillian flamenco dancer pays tribute to another Sevillian dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, to a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and moved with her family to London when she was three years old.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dances.
She lived a life full of passion, she was a pioneer of female emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought for the abolition of the corset, which prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, enchanted Isabela Bayón.
&quot;I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this character to me - I thought it was incredible.&quot;
According to the dancer, &quot;we are not about telling her life, but about capturing her soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of flamenco rhythms.
So &quot;butterfly dance&quot; evoked a guajira or &quot;snake dance&quot; some kind of tango.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance also corresponds to this aesthetic,&quot; she claims.
The performance counts on the involvement of two exceptional personalities: Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabele in one performance as in &quot;The Open Door&quot; (La puerta abierta), and dance teacher Matilde Coralová, who made an exception and agreed to collaborate with her former student.
&quot;Matilde represents the older Tórtola, a mature character.
I am happy that she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honor for me.&quot;
The performance also features the music and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; the drums of El Pájar, the viola of Raf El Viola and the collaboration of the actor Juanfra Juárez, &quot;who has the role of eternal guide of this kind of female artists who are prima donnas with everything and who are always in love with them&quot;.
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, which took place at the time in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, as she usually resided in London.
&quot;I wanted to commemorate her because I think she was one of those women who at a certain time had a huge influence, but today no one knows her and even less appreciates her work,&quot; says Bayónová.
The performance starts today at 20.30 at the Lope de Vega theater.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Arts
&quot;I recommend José Vicente Resina&#39;s exhibition &quot;Flamenco and Life&quot; because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
I was attracted by the simplicity and strong charge with which they affect the audience, and the consideration and respect for the photographed.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino can capture magical moments.&quot;
The book &quot;Diary of a newlywed&quot; also closes the triennial
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of &quot;Diary of the newly married&quot; in Saint Stephen&#39;s Church (New York), the place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Government of Andalusia to celebrate the &quot;Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón &quot; (2006-2008), organized to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the awarding of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of their death.
The &quot;Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón&quot; is coming to an end with a new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, the renovation of the Nobel Museum House and the traveling exhibition &quot;Juan Ramón Jiménez: That Ray of the Sun&quot;, which opened in May this year, and after touring the various Andalusian provinces, it is scheduled to move to New York at the time of the congress.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government has also ordered eight hundred copies of &quot;The Diary of a Newlywed&quot; edited by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis, to continue spreading awareness of the personality and work of one of Andalusia&#39;s most universal poets.
America doesn&#39;t like itself as much without Paul Newman
&quot;Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.&quot;
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who worked with him on &quot;Without Malice&quot;, and under the weight of the knowledge that Newman has left, she reveals her bleak vision of the abandoned American cinema and all of America.
Look how long it took them to get an Oscar.
And that he has been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be gravely ill.
Even so, he was everyone&#39;s tomboy.
&quot;Sometimes what you feel cannot be expressed in any way, and now I have lost a great friend,&quot; said a tearful Robert Redford, &quot;my life and my country were better because of him.&quot;
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
The father of film and country died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, a time when American self-esteem is at rock bottom, when reasons for pride are desperately sought.
When times are harsh and people without virtue and only a handful of those worthy of your admiration - you don&#39;t have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied an almost Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a champion of causes both lost and won, from an anti-drug foundation founded in honor of a first-born son who died of an overdose to his own brand of homemade food and organic foods.
An absolute treasure for a country that has struggled to rid itself of a suicidal food culture.
A tumultuous wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that not one man died, but an entire era.
Another Englishman, Oscar winner for directing Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was, without exaggeration, the highlight of his career.
Australia&#39;s bad boy, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest source of inspiration.
&quot;That vixen set a pretty high bar for all of us,&quot; states George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today has the courage to try to live as Paul Newman lived - based on honesty and leading a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy in today&#39;s media jungle, sometimes not even possible.
But fortunately there are such people, and Paul Newman is their role model.
Divorced once, he had since been married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he had been faithful, although he certainly had more than enough opportunities not to be.
&quot;Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have a filet at home?&quot; he liked to joke.
May he be proud of the fact that there is harmony on earth between his daughters and female admirers - this is not very common in America.
It is said that &quot;of all the great roles he embodied, he was most proud of that of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a selfless philanthropist&quot;.
The Imperfect Races of Olympic Madrid
Yes, many of us want the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after the failure of 2012, maybe 2016 will be.
But I ask: are we ready?
If we follow yesterday&#39;s race, I say: no!
It was spoken of as a perfect race, and in my judgment was the worst I have ever been on.
Such a bunch of nonsense that immediately, if it came to the evaluation and I was the examiner, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let&#39;s look at it from the beginning, one by one.
The nonsense starts with picking up the race number, which requires you to set off early.
That doesn&#39;t seem bad to me, but if you go there, let them give you everything (including a chip to prevent overcrowding of the track).
But not.
Here one had to pick up a number first (the first nonsense, going there only for that) and (after standing in the appropriate queue) - what a surprise! - they only had a size S t-shirt (another nonsense, because I need an XL size).
Where do we live?
Because of the crisis, they decided to buy only small t-shirts because it&#39;s less fabric and they&#39;re cheaper?
Well, those are minor things compared to what happened on race day.
In addition to having to go very early for the chip and the queue for it lasting over 15 minutes, the backpack also had to be handed in there.
The waiting time was over 35 minutes, which is something incomprehensible at a race where 11,000 people are expected.
So, as expected, the race started and we hadn&#39;t put our packs down yet, and when we did, it was much worse to pick up.
In addition, the wait was extended by 40 minutes by rain, which led to a general mutiny and an attack on the cabin.
I believe 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow and some, like me, won&#39;t see the correct time in the results review because of the chip they gave me which I assume didn&#39;t record my start time correctly.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, this one wouldn&#39;t come to mind.
And so I believe that we will have to dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT New Technologies Conference, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in a new AI-style image recognition and human interaction system - not too intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks like hailing a taxi (or, in Microsoft&#39;s case, a messenger that would move around campus society) and perceive what they hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, this &quot;receptionist&quot; can find out how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
It can also sort those present by conversation groups.
In the demonstration video, the receptionist notices a third person and understands that he is not part of the group talking to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she is seeing someone and tells her that he will attend to her in a moment.
All without the blue screen of death.
Ravishingly.
But of course this is the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about Microsoft&#39;s change in strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won&#39;t have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer figured out that if computers only had the bare essentials, unencumbered by commercial junk, they&#39;d be five times more powerful - man, Steve, they&#39;d be cheaper.
A discovery like thunder when we consider that Microsoft adds new functions and other &quot;extras&quot; to Windows version after version.
A change of direction would be a meritorious act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its relevance and so is the software.
When Google Chrome hit the web, I became one of those who gravitated toward the theory that it was Google&#39;s first move to compete with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
An operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer to communicate between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
It is true.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to think of the &quot;death&quot; of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms that idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system and, on the contrary, more to the Internet browser.
The computer turns on to launch Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time on the Internet than around the windows.
What are half of the applications that accompany the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it and here I have a small example.
I took this photo in a Microsoft employee break room in Redmond earlier this month.
There was a poster on the drink machine asking them to use their search tools: &quot;Your search. Our future.&quot;
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
By the way, the delay of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed last week.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let&#39;s count on 2010.
In Microsoft, they will definitely try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more like a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already in the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Cote d&#39;Azur, Leonardo di Caprio shone in one in Edward Zwick&#39;s &quot;Blood Diamond,&quot; as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s &quot;The Godfather,&quot; and it&#39;s part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to go into the list of his life roles, we can dive right up to the image of a typical muscle man with a pointed mustache who lifts dumbbells in a traveling circus.
It&#39;s basically nothing more than a typical cotton men&#39;s undershirt, fitted and sleeveless.
English speakers call it a &#39;tank&#39;, but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels stands out above all others.
Firstly, for its cringe-worthy name - although popularly called &#39;Marcel&#39; - which has a link to the sport, as, legend has it, it was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdano, lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The &#39;Marcel&#39; stands out from the rest with quality cotton, a unisex fit, a distinctive label and the (almost imperceptible) Belgian flag that the most emblematic tank models have as a neck detail.
And be careful, because the Belgian company does not only specialize in tank tops.
They also make college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy t-shirts, children&#39;s clothes, mini shorts...
Thoughtful pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it is a shame that they are only underwear.
They are too beautiful.
Honda attacks for the second time with its bestseller
In the month of November, Honda will start selling the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the predecessor of this single-compartment vehicle already had considerable space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
This is joined by improved engines that increase driving comfort and enable greater fuel economy.
Evolution rather than revolution.
This is the second generation Honda Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view, the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes to this sedan.
It should be mentioned, for example, the innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Even before we examine the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes to the market six years after the launch of the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we notice is the fact that Honda needed a shorter period than other manufacturers to rejuvenate this model.
Although the Jazz is a lesser-known model in Europe, it has become a sales phenomenon in other markets.
Such is the case in Japan, the country where the Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also during this year, 2008.
It was in Japan that almost a million units of the Honda Jazz were sold since its launch.
The second market became the old continent, with approximately half a million units sold in six years.
However, Honda aims for the new Jazz to increase sales in its category.
Thus, while in 2007 this Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of the Honda Jazz, in 2009 estimates count for 100,000 cars, which would mean an increase of 17% on the European market.
Regarding the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of the Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda&#39;s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2,000 units for the whole year.
It is the arrival of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
The management of the car company thus de facto expects the end of the year with a total number of 22,000 units sold, which means 4,000 less than in 2007 and a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market to 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
In 2010, this Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
Honda is banking on the success of its next new model to achieve that share.
It is the Honda Insight, a five-door compact hybrid with a length of 4.37 meters, of which the Japanese company promises to sell approximately 200,000 units per year worldwide.
In terms of markets, the Japanese manufacturer estimates that 50% of the Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentages will be split between the old continent and Japan.
The Honda Insight is expected to go on sale in the first months of next year, once it is unveiled to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, all dimensions of the new Jazz have increased.
Its length has increased to 3.9 meters (five centimeters more), width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and wheelbase to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, has not changed and is still 1.52 meters.
The increase in dimensions also increased the interior space.
This advantage was achieved both by using a new platform and by storing the fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was already used in the previous Honda Jazz.
The volume of the luggage compartment - which features a double bottom system - has also increased to 399 litres, 19 liters more than the volume of the luggage compartment of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are found in the version with the 1.4 engine, since the volume of the luggage compartment in the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Another improvement in addition to external elements - such as rear LED lights or the option of equipping with a glass panoramic roof - is easier access to the rear seats.
The doors leading to the second row of seats allow an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 in the first model Jazz.
The second generation Honda Jazz also has new engines.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two petrol engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which enables lower fuel consumption, lower CO2 emissions and delivers excellent powertrain refinement while delivering high torque throughout the engine&#39;s rev range.
The first 1.2-liter engine produces 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had 78 horsepower in the previous generation Jazz - has a consumption of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which reached 83 horsepower in the previous generation, the current one will reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horsepower has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
&quot;I want to be a young mother. I don&#39;t care who will be the father.&quot;
The great similarity with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz, although small in stature, is a woman full of life.
The Cruz sisters are now taking their new venture into fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, it means a lot more than just having some pretty, famous girls lend her name.
In Paris, she attended the promotional event organized by the Mango company in its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most important fashion awards sponsored by this Spanish company.
She is warm and shy and will win you over up close.
Tell us what you are doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango for this autumn-winter season, and at the same time I attended the announcement of the second annual &quot;Mango Fashion Awards&quot; and a dinner at the Opera House in honor of Valentino.
So it was a challenging, but at the same time exciting day.
What is the basis of your new collection for Mango, for which you have been working for the fourth season?
My sister and I both love movies from the 50s and 60s and have taken a lot of inspiration from them.
I also really like to wander around the city and watch women walking around dressed up, mixing and layering their outfits, I do that very often.
You are a dancer, an actress, a designer, so a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, but at the end of the day everything is connected and has many connections.
For example, I liked clothes from an early age, I always wanted to go to my grandmother&#39;s house, rummage through my aunt&#39;s closets and look at her clothes.
That was a sensation, almost better than going on a pilgrimage.
Then when I became a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to how I dressed.
You know that we dancers rely on how we are groomed so that we feel good when we look in the mirror during our lessons and rehearsals.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, that&#39;s when you really get into the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You recently turned 30, have you had a crisis?
Nowhere.
I feel better than ever, I&#39;m enjoying my 30s.
I find that the woman is already accomplished, experienced and enjoying life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn&#39;t scare me.
I&#39;ve been doing what I want since I was young, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So are you thinking about being a mother or not?
Of course I know that I will be a mother because my body demands it, and besides, I want to be a young mother, I don&#39;t want to miss it.
As for the father, I don&#39;t worry about it.
But I know one thing for sure, I will let my child experience the feeling of happiness and I will raise him with great love.
As for the film, you have several premieres of the films you shot last year.
That&#39;s right, and I&#39;m already looking forward to them coming to theaters.
I come from the theater world, so I&#39;m very impatient and restless, I want everything right now, and of course it&#39;s not possible.
I am looking forward to the premiere of &quot;La última hora&quot; and &quot;En busca de la tumba de Cristo&quot;.
Well, how do you like them...
A few days ago you made your catwalk debut alongside Naomi Campbell, is that right?
Well, don&#39;t say that.
It&#39;s not like I&#39;m going to walk the catwalk like a model.
Only Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, called me and invited me to London to participate in a benefit show for her organization &quot;Women for a Better Life&quot;, and the clothes we were showing - I also chose two models from our collection for Mango - , was auctioned and the proceeds were given to this Naomi&#39;s NGO.
People don&#39;t know that Naomi has such a good heart.
A lot of things are said about her and knowing her, I can tell you that many of them are not true.
Other than that, I&#39;ll stick to the good stuff he&#39;s involved in.
She asked me to perform for charity, but if she asks me to do a handstand, I&#39;ll do it too.
I will do whatever it takes to benefit third world women.
&quot;Auto bee&quot; prevents collisions
This time, Nissan took inspiration from nature, specifically bees, to advance the development of accident-preventing technologies.
This Japanese company has created a robot that imitates the flight of bees and thus avoids collisions.
Such is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at the Center for Technical Advancement of Nissan Motor Co. the robot was developed in cooperation with the Center for Advancement in Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the brand&#39;s general manager of public relations for technology, research and development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan&#39;s four-zone safety shield.
The robot&#39;s task is to strengthen the collision prevention ability of cars of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, very similar to the safety shield of a Nissan.
But most important are the bee&#39;s compound eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees, which allows the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual feature, engineers designed what they called a Laser Range Finder.
It detects obstacles up to two meters within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts it into a collision warning.
&quot;The moment an obstacle is detected, the robot imitates the bee&#39;s movements and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to a right angle or even more to avoid a collision.
The biggest difference to any existing system is the fact that all evasive maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If it wasn&#39;t, the robot wouldn&#39;t be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles,&quot; explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move up and down or diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and to the direction in which it is enabled by turning its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities as with bees.
Therefore, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, Nissan also used the rotation function to prevent the robot from colliding.
&quot;The device only needs to process information every few seconds and behave according to this data.
It does not require the retention of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, allowing it to operate without interruption with only two dozen KB of memory.
It might surprise you, but we&#39;re not talking about giga or mega memory.&quot;
This is the first step in the development of new technologies for immediate collision prevention, technology that Nissan predicts will be used in production cars in a decade.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the incorporation of a unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would guide the driver to the destination while avoiding obstacles on the way.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will have to install an &quot;alcolock&quot;
The Ministry of the Interior requires that a driver with three administrative penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol must install a system in his car that prevents him from starting the car while drunk or if he is not breathing.
The proposal became known already in June of this year and is now already included in the annual report of the Supreme State Attorney&#39;s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its goal is to get drivers back behind the wheel, so drivers will also have to complete a traffic re-education course.
In addition to the National Office for Transport Safety, the Directorate General of Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Technological Institute for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will also participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of motorists charged more than once for driving while intoxicated will get behind the wheel again in this state.
Alcolock should prevent this, as it is a system attached to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not take a breath first or if a higher than permitted alcohol concentration is detected.
Its price exceeds 1,000 euros and the culprit would have to pay it himself.
A study conducted in the USA in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device had a 65% reduction in offenses within the first year of implementation.
In Spain, it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address this behavior before it results in a criminal offence.
And in order to help its introduction, because the legal regulation can be carried out in the usual way, however, the necessary regulation of criminal provisions requires an amendment to the law.
The device is not yet available in any sales version on the Spanish market, although it has already been trial installed in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on a proposal by the PSOE (Spanish Workers&#39; Socialist Party), in which it is recommended to install this system in school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without &quot;peeptoes&quot;
With British precision, at 5:40 p.m., as scheduled, a Spanish Air Force plane carrying the Prince and Princess of Asturias landed in the presidential hangar at the Benito Juárez Airport in México DF.
The sun was just setting, but its rays still forced you to cover your eyes with your hand so that you could see the next couple exiting the plane.
The Spanish ambassador and other officials were standing under the steps.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish prince and princess were coming for a state visit.
- Yeah, that&#39;s great, it won&#39;t be possible to get to the airport at that time to pick up people... She&#39;s from there or something...
- No, no, sir, she is Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, that&#39;s right...
However, the Mexican press is well aware of who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and how significant their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport right next to the red carpet and the military cordon, which consists of 27 marines ready to fire a salute.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a dark blue suit and the princess, very modestly dressed and with flowing hair, does not have her usual &quot;peeptoes&quot;, apparently she has been told that there is a thunderstorm in DF.
They smile at the photographers and casually pose for them before walking into the hall where the official delegation is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they will be staying, one of the four largest in the city, a chatty Mexican TV reporter is waiting for them.
Enjoy the fear before you take out a mortgage
Admittedly, the US Treasury, in addition to having enough capital to dole out injections, does not lack ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risky mortgages from banks with questionable solvency, it created a popular-science game on the Internet &quot;Bad Credit Hotel&quot;.
Or the &quot;Bad Credit Hotel&quot;... or the messed up hotel.
The hotel and especially its receptionists look gloomy, so that you think once, twice or thrice whether it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, although not very detailed.
It is a site suitable for young people rather than a space for the general public.
And what happens when the game ends?
A dream room will appear inside the hotel.
At least something, because buying a house is better not to talk about...
Best subsidized fashion award
There is probably no better place in the world to announce a fashion award than Paris, and there is probably no finer designer and bon vivant than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to give international exposure to emerging fashion talent.
The prize is subsidized in the amount of 300,000 euros.
Belgium&#39;s Sandrina Fasoli, the winner of the first year, looked at her designs in the Manga window at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris yesterday and almost cried with emotion.
Sure enough, it&#39;s the firm&#39;s second largest store in Europe and has just opened at 1,335 square meters.
The largest is located in London.
Many events, together with the desire to thank the designer Valentino for taking the chair of the competition jury, led us to end up having a sumptuous dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
Festively decorated by Mango, the chairman&#39;s table looked even more amazing next to Chagall&#39;s finest works.
Heartbroken with grief over her brother&#39;s recent death, Nati wore a breathtaking dress by the brand and ELAH jewels, and strapped to her son Luis - a nearly six-foot-tall stunner - accompanied Valentino at the head of the dinner table at his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of the Mango company, accepted the welcome and, like a true gentleman, remained without a jacket along with Baron Rothschild, as they both offered them to two ladies.
Mónica Cruz, who arrived at the shop in - hand-designed - pants and shirt and changed into a long black sexy dress for dinner, was moved by a night walk around the Opera House accompanied by Goya Toledo, showed us the ballet rehearsal hall, and reminisced about other times one of the bars and indicated &quot;grand plié&quot;.
Inés Sastreová did not stay for the tour of the side buildings of the palace, but before leaving she showed us photos of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man who rides a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own bed linen and towels and requested in advance that no fragrances be used in his rooms.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh là là, c&#39;est la vie.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget the chaotic and frantic everyday life.
And to make matters worse, they are all summarized in one book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock rings every morning at 7 o&#39;clock as a punishment, but it&#39;s even worse to imagine yourself absorbed in the hurried rhythm that modern life brings.
The office is called stress and the computer is back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
However, there is neither one nor two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and problems of disconnecting from the world of work.
No, that number is no greater and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classical massages and &quot;spa&quot; therapy, Susannah Marriott has collected a whole &quot;menu&quot; of options on the pages of her book, adapted to the tastes and time possibilities of each individual.
The anti-stress book is called &quot;1001 Ways to Relax&quot; and thanks to the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK, it will bring peace to the bookstore.
If someone thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace in such areas as work or personal relationships, the &quot;handbook&quot; refutes this opinion.
In addition, it offers other procedures to be in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If the adrenaline that rebalances the body is no longer coursing through your veins, and stress has become a problem, it&#39;s time to sit on the couch, switch off and focus on reading.
Sleep talking
Some children talk at night.
I don&#39;t mean the ones who wake up and eagerly tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who talk while they sleep.
It might startle you the first time it happens, but it&#39;s actually insignificant.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somniloquia.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I&#39;m sure many of you have been told that he talked in his sleep at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example, once in a lifetime during high fevers), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once every few months...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is not just one reason that would explain its onset.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night rages, enuresis nocturna (wetting at night) or sleepwalking, but this may not be the case.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stressful or agitated situations.
In any case, this is an understudied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say single words, whisper, or just the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches...).
In cases where it manifests itself with great force, it would be advisable to observe the child and consult a specialist to find out if he has some problem that causes him great anxiety and manifests in this way.
We said that this is a harmless disorder, therefore it is not treated, only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
What we can do, however, is to keep in mind a few very simple precautions, such as:
Try not to disturb the child too much before he goes to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV programs or series.
For very nervous children and those who find it difficult to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
When somniloquy occurs, try to stay calm.
Remind yourself that it is harmless to the child and that he will not remember anything about what happened the next day.
Helpful hints
Don&#39;t be him.
It&#39;s pointless because he&#39;s not conscious and you&#39;re interrupting his sleep.
Even when he is talking, he is sleeping and therefore resting.
Remember that if it seems to you several times in a row that he is very worried, it would be advisable to seek advice or to find out what is causing such anxiety in the child.
If you can understand what he is saying (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to interrogate him and extract information from him.
It won&#39;t do any good because when he&#39;s asleep he&#39;s not conscious enough to organize his thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he dreams about, and therefore why he says it, so be very careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you draw.
Never tell your child that you can ask him about his secrets at night.
Not even for fun.
This causes great anxiety.
Just don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s nothing bad, it&#39;s just an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found a way to victory again after a long lean period.
Without playing a particularly big match, the yellow and black team created more chances and managed to convert one of them into a winner.
The game did not have a very fast pace during this encounter, in which the forwards struggled to gain ground.
After the first attempt by the visiting captain Kauffmann, who narrowly missed the line with a shot from distance, Illhaeusern started to have a slight advantage and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne in the air, Romain with a long leg or Diebold gradually came to irritate the Dannemarie defense.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive wall in the middle of the field and left only the agile Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The beginning of the second half proved to be decisive, first thanks to two Dannemarie chances with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeusern, which was taken care of by Marais, well placed to process the ball deflected after the previous Diebold attempt (53&#39;).
However, Illhaeusern&#39;s goalkeeper did not enjoy the joy for long, after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room, leaving his teammates weakened.
However, Dannemarie was unable to capitalize on it and did not cause any major problems for the Illhaeusern eleven, which withdrew a little to &quot;thicken&quot; the defense, except in the very last seconds of the match, when the ball flew very close to the crossbar after a great confusion.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
In order to face the demonstration of strength of the fishermen who severely disrupted the accessibility of several Breton and Normandy ports on Monday, the French President decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
The latter promised that it would be received &quot;in a constructive spirit&quot; and hoped that it would &quot;come up with concrete proposals&quot;.
The presidential visit comes at the same time as a general assembly of a &quot;crisis committee&quot; set up by Breton fishermen to get measures against a sharp rise in diesel prices, which have peaked at an average of more than €1.14 a litre.
According to Elysee Palace spokesman David Martinon, the president &quot;will talk with them about the solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure the conditions of employment and payment of seafarers&quot;.
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with intransigence.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out a &quot;snail operation&quot; (operation of slow-moving vehicles) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of congestion.
The leisure port of Quiberon was also blocked, but services in the direction of Belle-île were not interrupted.
A filter dam was put into operation on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors showed their determination already on Monday when they burned tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient at dawn, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d&#39;Olonne in the Vendée, where trawlers remained in port, or Le Havre, where about twenty vessels blocked the traffic of merchant ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique region stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges during the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait until Wednesday&#39;s meeting at the ministry before possibly deciding to act themselves.
In Guilvinec, on Tuesday, the &quot;crisis committee&quot; is to decide on how to continue on the path it has started, and on its participation in the forthcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by senior officials of the state fisheries department, which has not supported their movement.
&quot;The strike will continue&quot; because &quot;the fishermen will stop at nothing&quot; and &quot;do not want to come to Paris&quot;, declared Liliane Cariou, for example, the president of the fishing department in Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay diesel tax, currently pay around 50 cents per litre, but believe that the boat&#39;s profitability threshold is only reached when diesel is below €0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman spectacular
The unforgettable actor of &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Kid&quot; died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or even Sam Mendes paid their respects to the film legend and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its 2008 delivery assumptions
The Brazilian plane maker is counting on delivery of 215 planes this year, despite the threat of recession hanging over the global economy.
The world&#39;s fourth-largest aircraft maker, Embraer, is maintaining its 2008 delivery forecast of 215 units delivered, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer has high hopes for the Chinese market, especially considering the range of its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese clients over a span of eight years.
AIG is said to be considering divesting 15% of its assets
Insurer American International Group, which has been pulled over by the US monetary authorities, is considering selling more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion it was given as an advance, writes the Financial Times on Sunday.
AIG is ready to explore the sale of most of its non-life insurance activities internationally and pension activities in the United States, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
According to the FT, AIG&#39;s board met on Sunday evening to explore a potential transfer.
No confirmatory statement could be obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG plans to divest include its aircraft leasing arm International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in insurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the FT added.
No final decision on these referrals has yet been made, the FT continues.
AIG needs to raise cash quickly to pay off an 85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve Bank, with the risk that US authorities will seize 80% of its capital, diluting current shareholders.
Paris. Analysis of the historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange posted a historic drop on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson&#39;s bank bailout plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 777.68 points to 10,365.45.
The largest point drop in its history (by 684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, the day trading resumed after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 199.61 points to settle at 1,983.73, according to final after-hours data, and the broader Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500 fell 8.81% (or 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
Dejected since the start of the session, Wall Street literally fell after the surprise rejection of a plan to save banks by the House of Representatives, a plan that was supposed to allow the markets to find some stability again.
By a vote of 228 to 205, the representatives refused to give Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the funds he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
&quot;It&#39;s a bad signal to the market that sees Congress not being able to pass a plan,&quot; said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
&quot;It shows how much the market relied on this plan,&quot; she added, expressing concern that the project adopted in a few days would not come &quot;too late.&quot;
&quot;If this project is really doomed (...), the baton will immediately be passed to the Fed and other central banks to stave off the crisis, which would further strengthen credit conditions,&quot; Brian Bethune pointed out , Global Insight&#39;s chief economist.
Emphasizing the urgency of the situation, Piegza pointed out that in the United States &quot;every new day brings the collapse of one financial institution&quot;.
After Friday&#39;s collapse of Washington Mutual, the authorities organized the buyout of Wachovia&#39;s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis took a sudden turn, requiring immediate interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are not facing &quot;just an American crisis, but a global crisis&quot;, the FTN analyst added Financial.
The bond market rose strongly.
The 10-year Treasury note yield fell to 3.632% from 3.827% on Friday evening, the 30-year yield to 4.161% from 4.357% the previous day.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
The banking house Morgan Stanley has announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank, is entering its midst, which will issue nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital. Acceptance of this news was accompanied by a significant drop in its stock exchange rate.
A week after revealing their tentative agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG intends to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley&#39;s common stock at a single price of $25.25, for a total of three billion dollars.
The negotiated price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as of August 31.
MUFG Bank will invest another six billion dollars in acquiring convertible securities, which will provide it with a 10% yield and whose exchange price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the entire operation will take place on the basis of an average unit price of $29, i.e. 28% below its current exchange rate.
Still, Morgan Stanley shares lost 6.79% to $23.07 around 5:00 PM GMT.
&quot;This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley to the status of a bank holding company,&quot; explained John Mack, CEO of this American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted the new charter last week, which is supposed to allow it to diversify its activities, but also places it under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Its merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street&#39;s biggest aces to take a far more cautious approach than before.
The terms presented on Monday show, among other things, that the deal has been modified over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
&quot;Until a week ago, we thought,&quot; Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG&#39;s chief executive, explained in Tokyo, &quot;that our participation would consist entirely of ordinary shares.
However, given the current state of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize risks and also cover ourselves.&quot;
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay 7% less than book value for the Morgan Stanley securities.
And the operation will result in a reduction in earnings per share of about 20%.
The agreement assumes that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares in a year, if the latter are exchanged for a certain period at a price 50% higher than the exchange price, i.e. for about $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that MUFG will bring will allow it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its cash.
However, the spokeswoman of the group refused to provide more detailed information about the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG&#39;s investment, Morgan Stanley should boast a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan specified that since the end of August, he had &quot;significantly&quot; reduced his balance sheet.
Recent weeks have been tough for the group as its share price has halved while the cost of insuring against the risk of default on the debt has soared.
These costs took on the opposite trend on Monday, but remained high, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other &quot;survivor&quot; of the big Wall Street investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the buyout of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett&#39;s group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
Re-establish a republic around socialism XXI. century.
Such is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
Last Sunday, the third-named submitted for a vote, following the example of his counterparts and friends, a draft of the new Constitution.
And his mission is accomplished, because 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the vote, voted &quot;yes&quot; in the referendum.
According to these results, &quot;No&quot; won 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were blank.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to receive half the votes plus one.
Two exit polls and an NGO tally predicted a clear victory for &quot;yes&quot; on Sunday, putting it between 63% and 70%.
After all, Rafael Correa claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on the night from Sunday to Monday.
&quot;The Constitution won across the board,&quot; he assured, congratulating Ecuadorians in the seat of the Guayaquil governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which an observer mission of the Organization of American States (OAS) said was peaceful, was on a 444-point text building a &quot;new socialism&quot; promoted by the president.
The draft Constitution sanctifies the state&#39;s power over the economy by reserving to it the &quot;development planning&quot; of a country that lives mainly on the extraction of diesel by foreign companies and on foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
The Correa-sponsored proposal, which was elected in 2006, also expands the powers of the head of state, who will be able to serve two consecutive four-year terms and be able to dissolve the lower house.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and run for a new mandate in February 2009.
Among other things, the constitution consolidates the principle of free healthcare and education, which the president began to introduce in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also envisages a ban on the presence of foreign troops, thereby ending an agreement between Washington and Quito to use the Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US anti-drug operations.
Obama won on points in the first televised duel
After the first debate between the two candidates in the White House on Friday, the second debate followed, the task of which was to find out which of the pair John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters were not surprised when both declared victory in a televised duel watched by a third of American households.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain&#39;s performance, however decent, was not &quot;brilliant&quot; enough to allow him to halt the decline in the polls, five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose poll released Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% to McCain&#39;s 44%), sees the Democrat as the victor in the duel.
Among undecided voters who just matter, Obama is the winner for 39% of those polled, while 25% give McCain the win, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should have a chance to confirm his lead Thursday with the expected strong performance of his running mate, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
&quot;It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She&#39;s gifted,&quot; Bill Clinton pointed out over the weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, while at the same time emphasizing the &quot;naivety&quot; of his opponent in the issues that formed the core of the first encounter.
&quot;Senator Obama doesn&#39;t seem to understand that...&quot; was the repeated charge.
&quot;I don&#39;t think Senator Obama has enough experience and knowledge to be president,&quot; he also assured.
Since yesterday, republican TV spots have been in such an offensive spirit.
Obama, on the other hand, emphasized that he represents the future.
He did not lose his head and proved to be concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions and restore the United States&#39; good reputation in the world.
&quot;McCain still didn&#39;t get it, while Obama did,&quot; responded a Democratic spot over the weekend, accusing the Republican of not sufficiently considering the impact of the crisis on the &quot;ordinary American.&quot;
&quot;During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,&quot; Obama said yesterday before 20,000 people gathered at a campaign rally in North Carolina in pouring rain.
He didn&#39;t even say words like &quot;middle class&quot; or &quot;working&quot;. The financial meltdown clearly favors Obama, whom Americans see as better qualified to save the economy from the brink.
&quot;There could be a decisive turn next week,&quot; estimated influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama&#39;s &quot;economic acumen&quot; to that of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current calamity is &quot;the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policies, as operated by George Bush and as supported by Senator McCain.&quot;
The senator from Illinois reaffirmed that despite Wall Street&#39;s unexpected jumps, he should be able to cut taxes for 95% of Americans, and also pointed out that realizing the country&#39;s eventual energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy sources is his number one priority, along with the introduction of a health insurance system .
McCain, on the other hand, plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates carefully avoided questions about the deeply unpopular $700 billion (€470 billion) bailout plan passed by Congress last night.
&quot;What about you, did you notice that there were any elections in Minsk?&quot;
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated in the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday evening to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after polling stations closed in Minsk&#39;s main square to protest the irregularity of parliamentary elections.
Although no results have been announced yet, many young people came to demonstrate against the regime of President Lukashenko: &quot;dictator, resign&quot;.
Some admit that they didn&#39;t even go to the polls: &quot;What would be the point if they can do whatever they want with my vote anyway,&quot; says one young man.
He does not believe that this regime, which has remained friendly to foreign observers with the aim of renewing negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to make a turn towards democracy.
The sanctions, which include a visa ban on 40 Belarusian nobles and a freeze on some assets, could be lifted if the election is deemed clean by observers.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
&quot;We were kept away from election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote counting,&quot; complained Yuri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse grouping of twelve parties.
&quot;It&#39;s a cosmetic change,&quot; emphasizes Alexandr Milinkievič, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leading figure in the pro-European movement, &quot;because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our country it&#39;s the executive power.
If any opposition MPs get into parliament, it will be by being appointed, not elected.
However, their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and draft laws.&quot;
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in political functioning, because &quot;a dialogue with the European Union needs to be started.
If our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is hit by a crisis and we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
However, we want to be independent.&quot;
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the election process, will not declare the election valid.
He points out that the turnout seems to be too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all possible manipulations.
&quot;What about you, did you notice there were any elections?&quot; asks social-democratic leader Alexandr Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
&quot;There was not even a foot in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those who are most in favor of the regime.&quot;
The silence of the night once again took over the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate each other on their success.
19 hostages were freed in Chad
An Egyptian commando attacked the kidnappers of eleven tourists and their eight-member entourage, who were captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who had been held captive in the desert for ten days, were transported to the Egyptian capital alive and well on Monday.
They were freed by an Egyptian commando in Chad during the morning.
The hostages arrived around 3:30 p.m., apparently in good shape, on board a special plane to the al-Maza military base, close to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately taken, without an opportunity to speak to the press, aboard helicopters to a hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, to undergo medical examinations.
&quot;They are completely healthy&quot; and &quot;no ransom was paid to the kidnappers&quot;, declared the Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zohejr Garrana on the runway of the airport.
Since their capture on September 19 during a four-wheel-drive safari at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages has been dragged from one hideout to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard, the director of the Aegyptous agency, the safari organizer.
A senior Egyptian security official indicated that 30 members of the special forces, who approached the site aboard two helicopters, went on a raid during the night just before dawn.
&quot;There was a shootout, half of the kidnappers were killed and the others fled,&quot; said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the &quot;lightning&quot; unit were sent to Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy, Franco Frattini, spoke from Belgrade, where he is currently located, about the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
&quot;We have to admit that we achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of people from our secret services, from the special forces,&quot; he said without further elaboration.
He also denied that a ransom was paid.
Earlier in the evening, the Sudanese army said it had intercepted a four-wheel-drive vehicle carrying the hijackers while on patrol, killing six of them, including the Chadian commander, and arresting two.
The army claimed they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Unity (SLA-U), which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of the Department of Culture
The debate on the financing of culture fills the pages of newspapers with headlines and is the topic of the current election campaign.
The better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise up to plunder the pittances given to small museums, archives, archeological digs and national monuments that are starving?
What politician dares to remind the federal government that it is neglecting its monuments and its historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don&#39;t have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is donating three and a half million euros to the restoration of just Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
For our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organizations, in cooperation.
In Quebec, the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec has at least 40,000 volunteers organized into 211 history, monuments, archives and genealogy societies working to uncover history, preserve a trove of private archives and protect archaeological remains for a pittance.
Often these very companies are the watchdogs of our monuments, protesting in despair when promoters and leaders unleash their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will we finally see a tribune for history and monuments?
Interview - Blood that is sure again
Héma-Québec celebrated its tenth anniversary yesterday and its president, dr. Francine Décary, rightly rejoiced, as Héma-Québec became one of the most reliable and efficient suppliers of blood in the world.
Above all, he has regained the public&#39;s trust, which was seriously shaken after the contaminated blood scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, the national blood pool managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Division was contaminated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In light of this drama and a wave of public outrage, the Canadian government launched a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations to prevent such a disaster from happening again.
While Judge Krever delayed submitting his report, several provinces launched a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee played this role.
Following the Gélineau and Krever report, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec, to serve Québec, and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all provinces and both territories.
&quot;When Héma-Québec started its activities in 1998, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system,&quot; recalls Dr. Décary.
&quot;The situation was dire.
Through continuous efforts to increase the safety of blood products and constant work in this area over the following years, we regained the public&#39;s trust,&quot; he says, proudly adding that at the beginning of 2008, Héma-Québec was already trusted by almost 94% of the Quebec population.
Dr. However, Décary does not lose sight of the fact that &quot;trust is something very fragile&quot;.
Since its foundation on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the principle of prudence.
&quot;At that time in Europe we witnessed many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,&quot; says the woman who has led the company since its founding in 1998.
&quot;And we had no idea if this disease could spread through blood.
We therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau report, according to which, in the case when we do not know and when the spread of a serious disease is at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration that inevitably leads to death, it is need to take exclusionary measures.
In April 1999 we therefore refused blood from people who had been in the UK for more than one month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that this disease is transmitted through blood.
So this episode showed us that sticking to the precautionary principle made sense.&quot;
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting the HIV virus appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (NAT), which make it possible to detect the presence of the virus itself in donor blood directly, and not the presence of antibodies, on which the tests used before were based.
NAT tests made it possible to shorten the silent period that occurs between the moment a patient is infected and the moment when our techniques can detect the first viruses in the blood, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period to less than a week.
In this way, we have significantly reduced the risk that some donors could be infected without knowing it and without being able to figure it out.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of acquiring AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
&quot;In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will need to be distributed before someone becomes infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission through a blood product occurs.
I believe that today we can receive or prescribe the blood transfusion necessary for recovery in complete peace,&quot; says the head of the Héma-Québec management.
&quot;The challenge for us for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what disease-causing element may appear in the system.
Just last year, the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted to the blood through an insect bite.
You have to be constantly cautious,&quot; continues Dr. Décaryová, emphasizing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also count on a sufficient supply.
&quot;The needs are increasing because the population is aging.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging population also has implications for the blood donor network, which on average consists of only 3% of Quebecers eligible to donate.&quot;
Any healthy person at least 18 years old, meeting the admissibility criteria, but can donate blood only once every 56 days, that is six times a year.
14% of people offering blood are not accepted on average because they are carriers of AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have visited a country where mud fever runs rampant, they are excluded for a year.
&quot;With this 3%, we can maintain a state that meets the needs of hospitals.
Deficiencies are very rare.
However, the members of the donor network need to be replenished in proportion to how old they are and can no longer donate blood.
However, persuading people to donate blood is difficult, especially retaining and motivating them to become regular donors.
Today&#39;s life is so unfettered that we rarely find an hour to donate blood,&quot; laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissue, such as bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is almost exclusively used for major burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
Umbilical cord, once considered biomedical waste, is rich in stem cell-rich blood that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
&quot;We celebrated depositing our 1,000th cord blood sample into the bank a few weeks ago and expect to collect over a thousand a year.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplants,&quot; explains Dr. Décaryová, who describes the umbilical cord blood collection program as very popular.
&quot;Some moms are disappointed that they don&#39;t have access to it,&quot; because Héma-Québec doesn&#39;t have enough resources to offer this complex and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
Impact Montréal advanced to the semi-final round of the USL First Division knockout series with a 3-1 (4-3 goal difference after both legs) victory over the Seattle Sounders yesterday at Saputo Stadium in the second and deciding game of the quarter-finals played on aggregate.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a goalless first half on both sides, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino netted the remaining two goals for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could handle Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
It will be recalled that the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle, in the first of two quarterfinal games on Friday.
The Impact will compete against the Whitecaps from Vancouver in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder overcame a 3-1 deficit at home to eventually win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still advanced to the semifinal round with a 5-4 aggregate score.
The Impact are scheduled to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, however details of the series will not be confirmed until today.
In short - Kovalev&#39;s winning goal
The Canadiens&#39; front three is ready to start the season.
A unit of Alex Kovalev, Tomáš Plekanek and Andrej Kosticin powered the offense to a 3-2 Canadien victory on solo runs last night at the Bell Centre.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec collected two assists and Kovalev collected one pass in what was the Tricolor&#39;s fourth win in six preseason games.
Kovalev secured the win by scoring the only goal in separate bouts.
&quot;I&#39;m not ready yet,&quot; pointed out the Russian.
“I need one more match to feel good.
&quot;He tried to handle too much in the first period,&quot; noted Guy Carbonneau.
&quot;But I think he appreciated the end of the match.
He had a nice round of applause.&quot;
Charest bets north
The prime minister does not rule out calling early elections before the end of the year
Immediately after the end of the convention of the Liberal Party (Parti libéral), Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) is running in today&#39;s by-election.
&quot;Push the limits of our last great northern frontier&quot;: this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually arresting way at the end of the convention of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Lévis, without giving details.
During his speech, images were projected behind him in a sort of image grinder.
Three giant screens ran a loop with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, mines, Quebec from the perspective of &quot;Google Maps&quot;, maps, etc.
Generous funds, similar to the pre-election period.
After all, at the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would call early elections in the fall, although he pointed out that he has a very busy schedule.
The &quot;Plan North&quot; forms the fourth dimension of the &quot;vision&quot; the prime minister has in mind for Québec, a vision of a &quot;new economic space&quot; that includes a labor agreement with France, a convention between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the northern territory on the 49th parallel - has been frequently mentioned by the Prime Minister in recent statements, it has never been the subject of a presentation until now.
However, the prime minister limited himself to explaining why the North represents a &quot;jewel with enormous potential&quot;, but did not specify the date, the amount of investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
At most, he mentioned a few approaches to points that could be further elaborated: mainly hydroelectric power plants, forestry, but especially the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
The North, according to Charest&#39;s enumeration, contains &quot;nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds.&quot;
This &quot;territory twice the size of France is with us&quot;, &quot;is in Quebec.
And it&#39;s not just with us, it&#39;s in us,&quot; he emphasized, as if to show that he was invoking a certain national founding myth.
Québec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, the Prime Minister highlighted: the Abitibi gold rush, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
&quot;It&#39;s ours, it&#39;s our future,&quot; he added after pausing theatrically to survey the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec&#39;s territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded, the prime minister specified during a press conference.
&quot;This is a traditional position that has been repeated by all previous governments.
There is one line of demarcation on which there is no convention for a long time, and if the opportunity arises, I will take this position again on behalf of the government,&quot; he indicated.
Otherwise, &quot;in connection with climate change, it is also necessary to rethink our vision of the North&quot;, he declared when talking about the north-west transition, which will be open all year round due to the melting of the glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that taking territory becomes a duty.
What about Territories, Indigenous Peoples and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government will be very attentive to them and that the project will benefit them, especially the young.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist MP from Ungava), have already started negotiations with about thirty communities.
The activity was initiated by an inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Bouletová (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important position.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, &quot;not necessarily a summit&quot;, but a moment when &quot;a common vision will be laid out&quot;.
After all, the development of the North should take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
Plan Sever will be &quot;jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly,&quot; he promised.
Jean Charest described this &quot;vision&quot; as a seamless continuation of the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
&quot;Like the Liberals before us, we have changed our mindset to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.&quot;
Such was, after all, one of the still-shaking themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage&#39;s accession to the party leadership.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to rename the Beauharnois headquarters to the Adélard-Godbout dam.
&quot;From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who carried out the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who created James Bay, our party has been able to shape the future,&quot; declared Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he referred to another authority, this time a conservative one, namely the &quot;Roads to the North&quot; program of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
When it came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam hydroelectric plant, Charest emphasized that it was scheduled to start up in 2012.
&quot;I&#39;m just saying this between us, but I plan to be there,&quot; he confided to his membership, prompting considerable applause.
The same prime minister who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly not in 2009 either, did not rule out the possibility of calling for elections in the fall of this year, which is allowed by law.
However, he emphasized that his schedule is busy, especially with the Federal Council mission to China and the Québec-New York summit.
The weekend convention provided the Liberal leader with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, notably certain &quot;efforts to amend the constitution&quot;, which passed very smoothly: the PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebec) specifically calls for recognition of the &quot;specificity of Quebec&quot; in the Constitution.
It also wants Québec to appoint some of the members of the Canadian Broadcasting Council who would have veto power over decisions made in Québec.
On the part of the opposition, Plan Sever was received with skepticism in its main features.
PQ (Parti Québecois) leader Pauline Marois has pulled out again the Policy for the Development of the North of Quebec, which the Landry government launched in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it renounced the implementation of this policy.
If she had stuck to it, &quot;we would have been further today&quot;, remarked Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections are held today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it would support the adoption of Plan Sever in government.
&quot;However, we wish it wasn&#39;t just a show,&quot; explained Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - Dishonored Land
It was Vic Toews, ex-minister of &quot;justice&quot; (oh the irony) in Harper&#39;s cabinet, who dared to say of Louise Arbour last summer that she was a &quot;disgrace&quot; to Canada.
To denigrate a woman in this way, who led an unrelenting fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration, says a lot about the prime minister&#39;s entourage and about Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government which is the only one of all the participating Western countries not to repatriate its national locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that completely ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a young adolescent at the time of the alleged acts.
The only government that, despite Canada having signed the Geneva Convention, reneges on its word and lets it rot in the inhumane conditions of a child soldier.
The only one that relies on a travesty of justice to judge the guilt of the accused.
Let us remind you that UNICEF, Amnesty International and especially the Canadian Bar Association are advocating the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can receive a fair trial in Canada.
The same government turns a blind eye to torture: it cares little that this young man is psychologically destroyed, no doubt permanently, after so many years of torture.
We don&#39;t realize it, but we are witnessing the creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom, and our &quot;democracy,&quot; the words that Harper flaunts so much and that sound so empty from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, mistreat him, imprison him at the will of the head of the so far minority government (as will be the case after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that preaches Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what formed the reputation and respectability of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is in this disclaimer, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - Barrick Gold&#39;s Orwellian discourse
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir printed a letter from Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwellian logic, he confirms that the world&#39;s largest gold producer has launched a libel suit against three authors and a poor little publisher in order to provoke a &quot;transparent public debate&quot; and demands six million from them.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge truth, especially in libel prosecutions, but the law.
Not surprisingly, Garver completely misses this crucial distinction.
Or is the best way for Barrick Gold to lead a public debate, to bankrupt anyone who dares to take a contrary position?
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of Noir Canada will be forced to spend considerable sums to be prepared to defend themselves and fight a very uneven battle with an army of lawyers backed by the almost bottomless pockets of the mining company.
After all, the tactic in these lopsided battles often consists of ruining the defendants in order to force a settlement that silences the other party and terrifies anyone who dares to pursue the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, they should have presented their view of the matter to the public.
Contrary to what happens in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada the debate normally consists of an exchange of ideas, not blows with a baton.
Therefore, it was not enough for the mining companies to open their books, their documentation and create a real debate through newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent scientific teams that could shed light on the whole matter.
However, Barrick Gold seems to have no faith in public opinion and is dismissing petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand &quot;public debate&quot; and at the same time despise the views of the same public?
In the Vice President&#39;s world, the word seems to refer only to high-paid lawyers, not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow understanding of the term.
In a democracy, even rioters have the right to speak.
Barrick Gold doesn&#39;t understand - or doesn&#39;t want to understand - that the public who support the authors and publishers of Noir Canada do so primarily because they reject the brutal ways of the mining company.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and judge the matter, but through a civilized exchange of arguments, not in what many perceive as a gagging prosecution (as part of its &quot;public debate&quot; prosecution, by the way, Barrick just filed a formal summons to the authors of Noir Canada to give them official notice that they should stop using the term...).
Garver&#39;s surreal speech aside, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university&#39;s freedom of inquiry and truth-seeking, which are fundamental to any democratic society.
Overall, it denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate the facts and interpretations that constitute the very basis of intellectual activity.
If it is going to be impossible in a country like Canada to study and discuss topics that the rich corporations of this world don&#39;t like without exposing ourselves to repeated prosecutions, who else will be able to do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have created one if it had followed the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He has a right to reply.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold&#39;s overblown lawsuit makes it clear that, despite what it claims, it has no desire to have a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place measures to curb this type of wrongful prosecution.
Operation to save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
A new version of the $700 billion plan to stem the financial crisis that has been gnawing at Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it envisages: better control by elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of deposited public money, new measures to capture the number of houses foreclosed due to non-payment and also the right to monitor the amount of wages paid to executives of rescued companies.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and the representative of the Republicans at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, after the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
&quot;We have made great progress and reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets,&quot; said Bush administration official Henry Paulson.
&quot;Everything was done to keep the real economy and ordinary Americans safe from the crisis going on on Wall Street,&quot; the Democrat explained.
&quot;That&#39;s the bottom line: If we don&#39;t do this, the trauma, the chaos and the disruption to the daily lives of Americans will be enormous,&quot; said Republican Judd Gregg.
In the last few hours, negotiations have gone into overdrive for fear of the effect another failure would have on investor sentiment.
The designated time limit was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates for the American presidency were invited to the negotiations later and both spoke rather in favor of the agreement, without, however, omitting to express their dissatisfaction with the fact that it was necessary to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama credited the addition of some measures to the agreement, especially the one aimed at allowing owners to maintain their residence, and measures on the salary of the managers of the labor companies saved by the state.
&quot;When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate ourselves on.
However, these measures are necessary,&quot; he explained on television.
Asked by another station whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican rival John McCain said: &quot;I would like to see the details, but I hope so.&quot;
&quot;The rough outlines I&#39;ve read [indicate] that this is something we&#39;re all going to have to digest and move forward with.
To choose inaction is simply unacceptable,&quot; he said.
The goal of the $700 billion plan is to buy up the bad debts and risky and unsaleable assets of American financial institutions with taxpayers&#39; money.
The plan comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of the housing bubble, which first led to the collapse of subprime mortgages, then spread to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in a cash freeze and the collapse of banks and financial institutions.
Republican lawmakers are to blame for the collapse of the first draft agreement from last week.
Since the Democrats agreed that some &quot;toxic&quot; assets of companies in trouble the government will only guarantee, but not buy them, there is a belief that the impasse is averted.
In an attempt to reconcile conflicting views in Congress, a measure was attached that would allow the government to impose new fees to help it recover its deposit if it had to absorb losses for five years as a result of the program.
The new plan envisages the deposit of the first amount of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The deposit of another 350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get shares in the bailed-out companies, which will pay him dividends if they&#39;re profitable and which he can sell again when it&#39;s all over.
The federal government will be able to delay foreclosure procedures on properties linked to loans affected by the plan, as well as set limits on the amount of compensation and compensation paid to executives of affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to submit it to a vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet certain whether their plan will get the green light.
Yesterday, voices continued to be raised against this project in both the Republican and Democratic camps.
&quot;It&#39;s abundantly clear that Washington is not listening to you,&quot; Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told voters.
&quot;Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
However, profiting from taxpayers is not the solution.&quot;
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of congressmen called the &quot;committee of skeptics&quot;, presents the whole matter differently, but reaches the same conclusion.
&quot;Four hundred esteemed professors of economics, among them three Nobel Prize winners, wrote to us: we ask Congress to take its time and carefully examine which path to take,&quot; he said yesterday.
At the same time, it was confirmed again in Europe that this crisis is a world crisis.
Following the extraordinary meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after French bank BNP Paribas announced it was backing out of buying its rival, which has been on the brink of collapse since losing 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in the sovereign debt crisis. loans for the purchase of real estate in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, is among the twenty largest European banks and among the ten largest insurance companies.
&quot;We will not lose this money,&quot; Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
&quot;In return, we get voting rights in the bank and influence.
And that&#39;s exactly what savers and households can appreciate in today&#39;s uncertain times.&quot;
Meanwhile, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government appears to have started the nationalization of another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all the existing loans of the Bradford and Bringley bank, of which more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) were loans for the purchase of real estate.
According to its announcement yesterday, the Spanish bank Santander will buy the branches and client accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalized by the British government since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a socially engaged icon
His beauty with azure eyes has long been his trump card, according to others his weakness.
Has this American actor with the charming smile broken out of narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity and relentless talent inherent in him also distanced him from the power category that breeds true stars.
But what a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83 at his ranch in Connecticut as a result of lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the fat years of American cinema.
Less spectacular than Brando, whom he resembled and had long been a kind of rival on the screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and his mother was Hungarian.
From these European roots was born one of the famous faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because he saw this whole country in love with a self-made man, a Pacific War veteran, battle-wounded, who studied acting at Yale in the early 1950s, then attended New York&#39;s Actor&#39;s Studio and triumphed in the theater, on television, and soon in movie.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a race car driver who finished second in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979 and a sex symbol, despite being a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward from 1958 .
With him also go the shady places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the fuss of his own show business, which will forever remain somewhat mysterious.
A decent man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman&#39;s passing this weekend sent film buffs into a tizzy as his big roles jostle on the black screen of memories.
After him parades more than half a century of constantly changing American seventh art.
The charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his voluptuous wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a Hot Roof, Tennessee Williams&#39; 1958 adaptation, resurfaces in memory.
From the not-so-distant past (1990), we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his advanced age by a marriage that did not meet all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans went down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, the battered, violent, unforgettable delinquent of Robert Wise&#39;s Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, taken over after his death, which in 1956 introduced Newman to real fame.
Sympathetic gangster in the absolutely brilliant The Sting (Podraz), Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful pool player in Robert Rossen&#39;s wonderful The Hustler (1961), he would portray the same character in Martin Scorsese&#39;s The Color of Money, which would earn him his only Oscar out of seven nominations in 1987.
This face wandering through the ages, that was him.
And him again.
Different eras compete with each other in his professional career.
Young people know him mainly thanks to George Roy Hill&#39;s iconic Slap Shot (1977) in the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 in the Coen brothers&#39; The Hudsucker Proxy.
He then closed his career with the role of the godfather of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes&#39; Road to Perdition in 2003.
Unlike several film legends who left the craft relatively early, Newman stayed in the industry for a long time, though he decried Hollywood with its glitz, pomp and concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humor, &quot;a living challenge of underplaying&quot;, judging that he pressed the saw too much in his performances.
For the handsome Paul Newman, to whom roles came like on a platter, the profession was not always so gentle.
However, he played first lovers less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, rascals and despairers, whose decline and rebellion were reflected in his perfect features.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known sides of his shy sensibility.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), in which his wife Joanne Woodward played the leading role, gives a sensitive female portrait filled with melancholy.
He dedicated the 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of shame and sadness, to his son Scott, who he lost to an overdose.
In a flurry of tributes to Newman yesterday, his great friend and former co-star Robert Redford (they starred together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said wistfully: &quot;His presence made my life and this country better.&quot;
Magnanimity, love of life, these are the main characteristics of the deceased actor.
Leaving aside his legendary career, a great fighter for civil rights, ecology, independent film, opponent of the decline of Hollywood is also leaving.
We were used to seeing his likeness on bottles of wine vinegar, sauces, on biscuits and other foods, which we might find rather distasteful, although at first it was a gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to his Foundation for a Difficult Childhood.
Thus, rather than being swayed by fame, Newman was involved in society until the last moment.
He left a letter to his five daughters containing these sentences: &quot;Always and to the end your father was grateful to his lucky planet.
It was an honor to be here.&quot;
And it was an honor for us to follow the life path of such a clear-sighted and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory?
Soon, on October 8, the trial in the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
In addition to other crimes, including forgery of documents, the politician and his associates are accused of fraud perpetrated for a long time and systematically by a criminal organization, as a result of which extremely significant damages were caused.
According to the prosecutor&#39;s office, they used money obtained in public tenders for their own purposes and often documented the fulfillment of tasks with fictitious invoices.
Money from the state and municipalities - a total of approximately 65 million forints - went partly to the treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly to the pockets of individuals.
The method, which was also reported by the investigating office, consisted in the fact that the money obtained in public tenders was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no real consideration, and the associations never lived up to the accepted obligations.
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices were fake.
The forms for these invoices came from the Józsefváros market, the round stamps were made in Kiskunhalasi.
It was decided, among other things, on the circular trip along the northern shore of Lake Balaton, on which István Lados was sent by János Zuschlag.
According to his testimony, the first-named should have checked out guesthouses and restaurants.
In them, he asked for bills for his consumption, based on which invoices were then produced in the framework of public tenders issued by, among others, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, and the Self-Government of the capital city.
The invoices were mostly issued by István Lados with his partner András Őri, who, according to our information, most often wrote the reports needed to obtain subsidies.
During his &quot;study trip&quot;, Lados spotted a pub.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, this hospitality establishment provided meals for a ninety-member group from the Biztos Pont association.
However, according to the company manager, this facility could not fit so many people at once.
Likewise, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to a foundation called Jobb Jövőért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért, was full of formal and content errors.
The guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj only had three rooms, no more than ten people could sleep in it one night, yet one hundred and thirty guests were listed on the invoice.
Fillers of the forms with a rich imagination, however, went too far even when they included a company also engaged in the hospitality industry - Pigal s.r.o., in whose accounting, according to the information provided to the public prosecutor&#39;s office, the documents bearing the names of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even appear.
The head of the company, Győző Farkas, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor&#39;s office and shown the invoices, he immediately knew that they were fake documents.
&quot;Our business name and tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp.&quot;
As he added, in addition to the formalities, they also disagreed with the fact that according to the invoice they accommodated one hundred people, because they only have eleven rooms, which do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, the invoice also indicated catering, while their restaurant has been out of business for a long time.
The zealous invoice producers were not even convinced that the chosen Budapest travel agency only organizes foreign trips, and on the invoice with payment in cash, which also did not match the company&#39;s invoicing practice, they foolishly listed it as a Hungarian travel agency service.
In addition, as it emerged during the investigation, they also stated VAT in the document, although the organization of trips to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the company Hotel Révfülöp s.r.o. did not agree on the amount of VAT on the four documents presented to the Jobb Jövőért foundation. The company&#39;s activities are not subject to the mentioned 25 percent VAT, but rather 15 percent, in addition, the hotel employees issued only printed invoices, but the invoice produced was handwritten.
In addition, the &quot;publishers&quot; spoiled the invoice, for example, by stating that for one company, as it became clear thanks to the investigation of the public prosecutor&#39;s office, as a performed activity, the road transport of goods, which the company originally based on investment consulting, did not perform.
The fact that the invoices issued to the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért Foundation and the associations XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont fake, it also failed because of formal deviations - mismatched invoice format and fake stamp.
As in the case of the Ravenna ks company or the Sports Camp in Kunfehértó, whose representatives denied that they issued the invoices.
For example, the forgers did not even notice that the company HIB s.r.o. from Nyíregyháza was in liquidation at the time (2001), when a group from the Fiatal Városért association ate at it, which is why, according to our information, the liquidation commissioner of the company also denied that he had issued the paper .
They issued invoices knowingly
The second group of invoicers consists of those who knew they had to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Esély Budapestért Foundation issued invoices for around four million forints for the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of the organization Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták.
According to the indictment, one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, forced the manager of Collab s.r.o. to issue a fictitious account.
The company Biogate sr o, currently in liquidation, also cooperated with Zuschlag and his associates, which in 2003 supplied the Jobb Jövőért foundation and the Atlasz and Vörösfenyő associations with invoices worth approximately five million forints, which were not backed by real economic activity.
Nor the movement of money, because the created invoices were later canceled, which the organizations forgot to mention in their documents.
Another group of invoicing companies includes those that had ties to the defendants.
For example, Iván Kubatov was the authorized representative of the Ukrainian executive of Delta Trió s.r.o., dealing in fuel and motor vehicle trading, based in Budapest, but the company cannot be found there.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment worth approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the data found by the investigation, these invoices were bought by the Kiskunhala company Cash Investment s.r.o., which was in liquidation since September 14, 2005.
The manager of this company was a man from Romania, to whom Iván Kubatov was also supposed to hand over documents relating to the company in the years 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that on behalf of the company he issued invoices to the Atlasz, Hoppá associations and the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért foundations and himself accepted their consideration.
Expressly at the request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian masons founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s.r.o. and Jos-Investment ks
In fact, however, none of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they did not get work.
Nevertheless, the companies benefited him, because at the request of the co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their articles of incorporation, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations Atlasz and Y-Generáció connected to Zuschlag.
On behalf of the companies Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave the organizations a total of 15 invoices worth HUF 14.2 million.
The State Prosecutor&#39;s Office concluded that Kubatov had earned 10 percent of the amounts stated on the invoices and VAT.
The man also used the company Szi-Beri kt to issue fictitious invoices, this time for a tender for the Biztos Pont association
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szötségét and Modern Magyarországért submitted proposals to the public tender of the Mihály Táncsics Foundation (TMA), a public benefit organization of the Socialist Party.
They received 500,000 forints each, but did not spend the amounts on the goals stated in the proposals.
In order not to reveal it, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from the company Works Team s.r.o
After all, these invoices were found during a house search in Árpád Kemecsei&#39;s office at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, some of the defendants will probably describe the process of producing the invoices, as they already did at the prosecutor&#39;s office.
It might be more interesting if the main defendant János Zuschlag himself decides to reveal everything.
His statement so far is not very detailed, and although he has promised several times to explain everything in detail, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for paying a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, maybe the socialists made a deal with him and Zusi will take it upon himself.
After all, he could still be offended, because his requests to ease the conditions of his detention, namely to place him under house arrest, have so far gone unheeded.
While perpetrators of economic crimes who have caused much greater damage that they have not yet paid can walk around freely or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have this option.
The psychology of trumping: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money and overprice goods.
Neurological and economic foundations of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior were discovered by researchers from the field of neurology and economics at New York University.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people don&#39;t want to fall behind in a competition like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay too high a price.
Using an experimental auction, the research attempted to map the scheme of this &quot;game&quot; in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers bet, the other group participated in a game auction, while the active areas of the subjects&#39; brains were examined using the method of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
In both games, the participants could win money, but in the auction game, an important element of which is to trump the other side, a unit located under the cerebral cortex, called the striatum, began to work intensively when losing.
Among many other functions, this brain region plays a role in the &quot;self-rewarding&quot; mechanism of the nervous system.
According to the researchers, the screwing up of the price can therefore be explained by an attempt to avoid a violent reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, members of the research team of economists conducted a financial cross-sectional survey.
In it, three groups bid against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was simply told what the fair value of the product was and they placed bets.
In addition, members of another group were promised that if they emerged victorious from the game, they would receive another $15 as a reward.
The third group, on the other hand, received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members also received this money.
Thus, the difference between the two groups basically consisted in the fact that one emphasized winning and the other emphasized losing.
However, the members of the &quot;against losing&quot; group were willing to go higher than the control and &quot;winning&quot; groups, which confirms the neuroscientists&#39; hypothesis.
&quot;These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
Until now, they explained the phenomena observed at auctions by the joy of winning and avoiding risks.
It was only neuroimaging methods that helped us resolve the contradiction between these two theories so that we now arrive at a third explanation,&quot; said Andrew Schotter, a professor at NYU&#39;s School of Economics.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are treated. The reason for this is that the sick often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a collective name for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but the causative agents of the disease and the diseases caused by them differ from each other.
Depending on the causative agents of the disease, hepatitis viruses are spread in two main ways: hepatitis types A and E through the digestive system (for example, infected food, water), hepatitis types B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal secretions, saliva) .
Travelers should in any case protect themselves by vaccination against virus A and B, there is no vaccine against virus type C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected food, they are usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal discomfort, the urge to vomit.
After that, the skin and the whites of the eyes become jaundiced, the stools become lighter and the urine becomes darker. Treatment can last two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people worldwide die from a more serious form of the disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only every tenth infected person is treated with medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most of the infected do not even know about their disease, the causative agent of the disease destroys the liver cells insidiously, so the first symptoms do not appear in many cases until 20-30 years later.
Therefore, early prevention and regular screening is very important.
In three groups, the disease occurs much more often than average: among people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, among drug users, and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C virus worldwide is 200 million.
Since the disease can already be proven by a routine laboratory examination, a person should contact his general practitioner if he notices any symptom of unknown origin.
If detected early, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body, thus preventing contagion and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized worldwide in 2004 by organizations representing patients.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of its occurrence and the importance of early recognition of the disease.
The Benelux governments will nationalize the Fortis bank
The Benelux countries will help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to get into trouble due to the spreading effect of the US mortgage market crisis, with a partial nationalization: the three countries will support the money and insurance institution, which also has a capital participation in Hungary, with the amount of 11.2 billion euros.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed on this at the highest level this weekend, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Economic Competition.
Fortis Bank is the first in the Eurozone to fall into a major crisis as part of the international financial market crisis, which has been spreading in waves for more than a year, and the decisions made in this matter could be considered as precedents from a certain point of view.
According to the decision, which was born on Sunday night, all three states will buy almost half (49 percent) of the bank&#39;s assets there.
The bank will definitely sell a part of its capital holdings, especially - mainly the insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
The shares of Fortis Bank began to fall sharply last week, and in the second half of the week serious signs of crisis were already appearing in the institution.
Analysts agree, however, that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let it fail.
The company&#39;s securities fell by 12 percent on Friday alone, to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given current share prices, the group&#39;s total market capitalization is around €14 billion, but this is unrealistic, according to company executives.
After all, the management of the company blames the fall of Fortis shares on the uncertainty in the overseas market related to the acceptance of the plan of the American package worth 700 billion dollars.
On Monday, the shares rose slightly.
On Friday, the new CEO Filip Dierckx was appointed to head the bank.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but no one has yet come forward with a more serious offer.
The Belgian government has already announced that investors need not worry, they will not lose their money.
Bank clients have not yet panicked and branches have not been attacked.
Fortis Bank has a separate branch in Hungary and has also bought several leasing companies.
Who believes in god, doesn&#39;t it hurt so much?
According to the results of recent research, faith in God works as a certain analgesic that could ease the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists from the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, investigating how belief in God affects the perception of pain in humans, the British newspaper Telegraph reported.
In a rather bizarre study, they subjected 12 Catholic believers and an equal number of atheists to electric shocks while they all observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to eliminate a large part of the pain.
Thanks to a technique that examines the human brain in detail, it was also shown that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
The research is the first in a series of investigations in which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university are participating.
The test was carried out precisely in such a way that they attached a sparking device that emitted electric shocks to the left hand of the test subject.
The researchers asked participants to gaze intently at two paintings: Sassoferrato&#39;s Virgin Mary from the 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci&#39;s Lady with an Ermine, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would induce a certain state of piety in the believers, while they chose da Vinci&#39;s painting because it is not too different from the first one and has a calming effect, according to them.
Subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, during which time they received 20 electric shocks in four consecutive parts, while separately viewing an image with a religious or general theme.
Catholics reported that looking at the Virgin Mary made them feel &quot;safe&quot;, as if they were &quot;taken care of&quot; and &quot;calmed, filled with peace&quot;.
According to their statement, they felt 12 percent less pain when viewing a painting with a religious theme than when they had Leonardo&#39;s work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerfully impressive image even with atheists, you just need to find the right photo.
&quot;We would have to find an image that they will perceive very positively, from the position of a mother or a father,&quot; said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
&quot;The practice of faith should change, and in many cases will change, our personality,&quot; added Wright.
After such great results, the only question is what effect it would have on the pain regulation of the faithful if they were shown a Madonna by Leonardo or a painter of similar caliber.
Would looking at a quality Virgin Mary mean achieving even better results?
You are what you share of yourself
On its tenth birthday, Google can claim that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as in the sky overhead; they know where they were on vacation, what professional examinations they attend and what they are interested in.
However, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the heads of the company, this is still not enough.
However, as for the skeptics who draw parallels with Orwell&#39;s dark vision, the very nature of Web 2.0 is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google&#39;s main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary in order for the founders of Google to stick to their original intention, which was: &quot;Let&#39;s organize all the information in the world!&quot;
According to the interviewed representative of Google, even after ten years of groundbreaking work, the company is only at the beginning of being able to work with all information.
When asked what it will be like in five years, Schmidt said that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like &quot;what should I do tomorrow?&quot; or &quot;what job would actually be suitable for me?&quot; - however, the software will not be able to answer such seemingly simple questions until they know enough information about the users.
Not all Internet users are well aware that during an Internet search, the searched words are accurately recorded, as well as the IP address from which the search was made and to which pages the interested party moved after the search.
Thanks to the Personalized Search service launched two years ago, users can, for example, keep their surfing history, look back at what they searched for and what they clicked on, thanks to which, in the long term, results are generated that are much more tailored to them - the same logic will be based on and the Recommendations service, through which the system will offer us products and services based on previously stated and saved preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I&#39;m up to? - ask users who are afraid of Google&#39;s data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company has a threatening effect, the backlash does not evoke in Internet users a sense of guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all search terms are not only captured, but in justified cases can also be released to a third party, in such legal cases the personal rights of Internet users are not protected.
The best-known recent example was probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that enabled the identification of pedophiles from the Orkut community site, set up through it.
However, Internet users who are worried about personal rights could still breathe a sigh of relief in May, when the company hand in hand with the organization for the protection of electronic rights EFF successfully proved its truth in the dispute with the FBI: Google may not be forced by any article of the constitution in the future. to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully seized nearly fifty thousand web addresses and a thousand search terms, which it obtained citing the strengthening of the Child Protection Act passed years ago, but was unable to obtain individual user search lists, or complete lists of websites and keywords covering a period of two months.)
The opinion of Google is thus quite contradictory: it is whipped by those who are afraid of providing their personal data, because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be exposed to harm by starting to use Google services, and they oppose it with a revolt like belongs to multinational companies with a conservative image.
And so far, the American geek culture and its wild offshoot, grouping around itself enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, see in it a new generation of large companies, &quot;a corporation that is now snarling&quot;, in contrast to its rival Microsoft, considered because of Windows as the conqueror of the world, even though both are fighting for the same goals.
This may be due to the fact that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require an identification code from its users and does not ask them to pay for its applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and a package of programs feels much more accessible, more youthful, &quot;cooler&quot; than the practice of the official software giant.
But it may also be due to the fact that geeks accurately understand the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personal rights, which has brought with it precisely one of the most popular keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
After all, Web 2.0 is about nothing but collaboration, about intentionally leaving traces behind and using the communication channels available to us, and although the extent of these is different for everyone, the essence remains the same: we show up.
The average young person can maintain a profile on several community sites, from Facebook to Xanga, which he can easily connect to other services, for example, Twitter or the last.fm application, recording the music he listens to, all of which he can then connect to navigation systems, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, in addition, he can write a blog, where his latest photo galleries, which he saves on Flickr or Picasa, will automatically appear.
At the same time, we can read about a lot of exemplary cases from which it shines: in the morning, a girlfriend, looking at a flood of photos of mutual friends, can easily figure out who her naughty boyfriend spent the evening with, or a company can fire an employee just because he describes his an honest opinion about senior management: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has been completely re-evaluated today.
The one who lives an online life consists of what he shows of himself, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today&#39;s youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something or at least avoid the Google monopoly has the option (starting with Scroogle, for example, who uses the Google search system, but intentionally leaves no traces).
For example, a significant number of people deliberately do not register on community sites so that they cannot be found. Google&#39;s online applications, from a text editor to a photo editor and a news portal, can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and that do not build the best possible profile of us.
Public opinion is not-so-secretly waiting for Google to show its teeth.
With a current value of $156 billion, the business is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising space threatens advertising agency investment and services are being rolled out at an ever-accelerating pace they seriously make life difficult not only for Microsoft but also for numerous other software designers.
However, critical observers also find disturbing counterpoints: for example, the senior management completely rejected the protests of the employees after it doubled the fee for the company nursery school, the employees&#39; frequent daily meals were too expensive according to the company management, but all this is lost beside the fact, that Google bowed to the Chinese government back in 2006 and, in terms of their agreement, will filter out every finding that goes against the good taste or the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company&#39;s internal rules is that it never advertises new services in advance, only when they can already be used, but what is certain is that the expected problems of the coming months and years may move the world in new places: while some believe that Google&#39;s project aimed at for scanning and archiving books and magazines is taking on such dimensions that the company will soon have to deal with the US Supreme Court, others are afraid of its Health system, because in it we can compile a complete personal health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google compiles a genetic database can then serve as good starting material for the following generations of science fiction writers, Cory Doctorow&#39;s famous novel &quot;Scroogled&quot; describes with Orwellian reminiscences a future in which one can get frighteningly close to a person only with the help of data from google.
The double murderer from Ózd was helped by two juveniles to remove traces
Two juveniles were interrogated by the police in the case of a double murder in Ózd, according to reasonable suspicion that they helped to remove traces of this crime, said the spokesman of the High Police Directorate of Borsod County on Tuesday.
The persons admitted to the activity of which they were suspected and are currently accused of aiding and abetting a crime.
Both juveniles, according to information from MTI, two girls, are being prosecuted at large.
Aiding and abetting a crime is punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect of a double murder in Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into temporary custody on Sunday.
He is suspected of the crime of pre-planned multiple murders for selfish reasons.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed the 53-year-old a larger sum.
The suspect did not want to repay his debt, so he lured his creditor to an establishment in Ózd last Wednesday, where he first killed a man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from MTI, the young man was preparing in advance to commit the crime, which is evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the scene of the crime.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are being investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - was offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a 100% stake in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is the fact that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wishes to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
As the Czech economic daily E15 writes, the Poles&#39; offer represents the highest amount that has yet been offered to interested parties for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic stock exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have so far submitted offers.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties, and did not rule out that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Stock market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders&#39; agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25 percent, followed by Česká spořitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. arl with 13.5 percent.
About the financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
In their Tuesday comments dedicated to the deepening international financial crisis, leading European newspapers are already recalling &quot;the second September 11&quot;.
We have the US president to thank for the global financial disaster, claims Rome&#39;s La Repubblica. The President was not even able to rally his own party in support of that hastily paid-for bill aimed at remedying this desperate situation...
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, which billionaire and investor Warren Buffett recalled, we could talk more about a second September 11.
Also, part of the Madrid press sees the culprit in Washington.
According to the newspaper El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of a collapse of the American financial system is constantly growing, for which the whole world will eventually pay.
Bush&#39;s plan was not perfect, but after the vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political tool to solve the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - at the very moment when one of the biggest changes in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger points out.
Individual states can still throw faltering financial institutions a lifeline, and taxpayers can save them from failure.
However, if more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither cash nor other improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, the member states of the European Union need to get over their national egoism and unify control over the fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, the surviving financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros, reminds the Vienna Der Standard, according to which fears that, like the Americans, European taxpayers will have to dig deep into their pockets to solve the crisis, are becoming more and more real.
Until now, the European Union has not seriously dealt with the crisis that is sweeping the old continent like a tsunami.
The &quot;rescuers&quot; don&#39;t have to wave hundreds of billions of euros right away, but it would be good if they firmly established in which case it is reasonable to reach for taxpayers&#39; money in order to avoid even greater damage.
A smart car imitates the flight of a bumblebee
So what would be the best method of developing collision avoidance technologies if not to imitate obstacle detectors found in the natural world?
For example in bees.
The initial strategic idea of the surprising project, presented at the Japanese CEATEC trade fair, was inspired by bumblebees to engineers from the Nissan company. It was about how to build a new generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has constructed the BR23C Biomimetic Robotic Driving System, a robotic minicar that is equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
&quot;During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety protective envelope,&quot; Kazuhiro Doi, the brand&#39;s general manager of technology PR and R&amp;D, explained at the show.
An important role is played by compound eyes, which allow bees to see in all directions with a visual angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the compound eye, engineers reached for the idea of a laser range finder.
It identifies obstacles up to 2 meters in front of the BR23C in a 180-degree field of view, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately converted into an operation aimed at avoiding a collision.
The obstacle is caught in a fraction of a second, after which the robotic car begins to imitate the movements of the bee, turning the wheels to the extent necessary to avoid a collision, and immediately changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this evasive maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive manner.
&quot;If this were not the case, the robot car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,&quot; explains Toshiyuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the Robot Car Project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology conforms to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety protective envelope, within which a collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must mirror what the bee is doing to avoid other bees.
This process should not take more than the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed up, down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be turned.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to the bees when dodging, in the case of the robotic car only the possibility of rotating movement, acceleration and deceleration was applied.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they last longer than lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, what is important is an instinctive, intelligent response, not the ability to process, much less store, data.
This mechanism must process and respond to only a few incoming signals per second.
It doesn&#39;t need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it only uses a few kilobytes of memory at all times.
It does not need memory with a gigabyte or megabyte capacity.
It&#39;s the first step in developing the instant-avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates could be in production cars within a decade.
Another possibility of application can be the connection of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the motorist to the specified final destination after avoiding obstacles in the way.
The damn precious baby already has a name
The law on the economic rescue package worth 700 billion dollars, which is to be divided into several installments and which aims to buy out bad loans of banks, is already in writing.
Half of the amount will be used in the first round.
After further negotiations that ended just after midnight EST on Saturday, congressional officials reached an agreement in several days of debate on a bailout package worth a total of $700 billion, Reuters reported.
&quot;We&#39;ve made significant progress,&quot; said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, who said the only thing left to do was write the deal.
Both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain also supported the package compromise.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said of the outcome of the compromise: &quot;The program will work and be effective, but more steps need to be taken.&quot;
The written form of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8:00 pm Washington time (that is, on Monday at 2:00 am Central European time), but it did not cause any particular rise in the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the draft legal standard called the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which is to establish the program, then it will be the Senate&#39;s turn.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, after which news of the deal was also welcomed at the White House.
&quot;We are pleased with the progress made overnight and greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,&quot; White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
After all, the program differs from the Bush administration&#39;s original proposal, in which the entire sum of $700 billion was to be spent at once on the purchase of low-quality mortgage-backed securities.
Now, up to half of the $700 billion can be spent in the first round, with $250 billion to be used immediately after Congress decides on the matter, expected on Monday, and used by the Treasury Department to buy mortgage-backed securities rated as poor quality, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will then depend on the president&#39;s decision.
The program will be overseen by a special board, which will also include the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Spending the second half of the $700 billion will depend on the next decision of Congress.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can use a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy back bad loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, or other &quot;toxic&quot; loans.
The purchase can take place within the framework of auctions or directly, informed the competent representatives of the ministry.
The legal norm will allow the companies in question to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee for funds representing a cause for concern, for which the company will then pay a price corresponding to the amount of expected damages.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary funds to spend up to $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the American financial system, whether it is a large-scale purchase of bad assets, to insure them or to prevent the systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the big financial institutions.
&quot;We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed,&quot; he added.
Heads of banks that have got into trouble and are waiting for state aid, on the other hand, can count on the government to reduce their severance pay - which in overseas slang is simply called a &quot;golden parachute&quot;.
Their payments will be restricted only in certain cases, moreover, these restrictions will depend on the type of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The restriction basically means that if the ministry buys in the auction, there will be a tax surcharge on the golden parachutes, unless the fallen bank directors are sent straight into retirement.
In the case of direct buyouts of non-performing loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the money for management is not excessive.
It should be added that the already existing golden parachute contracts will not change, the restriction applies only to new contracts, which should be an additional incentive to participate in the program.
&quot;This is the first time in American history that there will be a statutory cap on CEO compensation,&quot; House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, a Democrat, commented on the provision.
In addition, the state will have the right to obtain a share in the banks participating in the program, which will reduce the risk for taxpayers, because once the economy and with it the rescued bank get back on their feet, they can also make money from this transaction.
The plan of the proposal includes that in the next five years, the president must submit a proposal to Congress setting out how the expected losses from the financial sector can be returned to taxpayers.
Of course, there were voices on both sides expressing doubts about the plan.
&quot;This is not what the American people asked for, this is not going to protect taxpayer dollars,&quot; said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
His fellow Democrat from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that the very people responsible for the collapse of Wall Street pushed for the provision.

Visa-free to the United States next year?
According to Kinga Gönczová, there is great hope that the US-Hungarian visa-free agreement will enter into force around January 12. The Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about this in Chicago in front of leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her opinion, &quot;almost everything now depends only on whether an electronic system for permitting travel, or controls, will be built in time across the sea&quot;.
At the same time, she pointed out that the new system will not include an entry permit, but tourists will have to be registered before departure.
The representative of Hungarian diplomacy continues negotiations in Washington from today.
He will meet Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will present the Middle Cross with a Star of the Order of Merit for the Republic of Hungary, and hold talks with foreign policy advisers to Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of a bank bailout
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major American parties, on Sunday both pledged their support for the government&#39;s $700 billion bank rescue package, but there are also politicians who are calling for the resignation of the Treasury secretary.
After several days of marathon negotiations between Congress and administration officials, it was announced early Sunday morning: a basic agreement had been reached on a bank rescue package.
The financial package, which aims to thaw the crisis of Wall Street and the frozen credit market, has become a central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain identify themselves as the more suitable of the two candidates who would lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, at the same time as economic issues came to the fore, Obama gained a certain advantage again and McCain&#39;s lead, which he secured after the Republican convention by nominating Sarah Palin for the post of vice president, disappeared.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that the $700 billion package would be quickly passed by Congress.
He emphasized that the draft contains passages related to consumer protection, which he also supports.
&quot;We must act now, responsibly (...) your jobs, savings, entire industries, the stability of the entire economy are at risk,&quot; he told a crowd of 35,000.
He didn&#39;t miss an opportunity to call McCain&#39;s ideas about the economy outdated.
In an interview with ABC television, McCain explained: &quot;It&#39;s going to upset everybody a little bit (...) but doing nothing is simply not an option.&quot;
As the Republican senator stated, the proposal includes the establishment of a commission overseeing the finance minister and the limitation of severance pay for top officials, which he insisted on.
Obama stated for the CBS station that McCain did not have a significant role in the negotiations, on the contrary, he himself was in daily contact with the minister.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Overview of the press of the German language area
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters within it have become more self-confident - this is how Der Spiegel analyzes the CSU&#39;s weak result in Bavaria.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled &quot;Bavarian revolution eats its fathers&quot;.
According to a well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
Christian socialists have been rebuilding Bavaria for decades - and now these very modern citizens are turning away from them.
At the same time, the change of seasons is a problem for the entire Christian democracy, and thus also for Angela Merkel.
The debacle was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday, a process that could be predicted for almost exactly ten years ended: the undisputed hegemony of one state party ended.
Already ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, the first time since the 1950s that it was below the 50 percent mark.
This was repeated three years ago during the elections to the Bundestag in 2005, i.e. still in the often mentioned Stoiber era.
The reason is the modernization that the CSU has consistently carried out in this country and which is eating away at its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they got the timing very wrong. Secularization, the results of education, the settlement of Germans from the east and the north in the developing regions of Bavaria, however, could not be without consequences for the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization is associated with the growth of possibilities, which also has its visible political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters within it have become more confident, more critical, more stubborn.
It is also obvious that in recent weeks it is precisely the classical civil strata that have distanced themselves the most from the CSU; self-employed people, self-employed people, individuals with a high school diploma and university education.
This has already shrunk the CSU&#39;s support below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled &quot;Who, with whom? Party leaders are restrained in coalition issues&quot;, the conservative Viennese daily deals with the confused domestic political situation resulting from the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids the interference of the SPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ appears to be open to all negotiations, the Greens do not want to agree on a coalition yet.
The election is over, now it&#39;s all about the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the leaders of the parties did not let their cards be seen much.
SPÖ chairman Werner Faymann confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
And the SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is definitely possible - it exists in some federal states and in social partnership.
Faymann left open the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the ÖVP, as vice chancellor.
As he put it, the Schüssel-Molterer course was overruled in any case.
Repeating this direction is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to red offers.
As he said, the cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the ÖVP&#39;s internal affairs.
Whether his party will choose the opposition or join a coalition is still completely open in the party, these questions must be discussed definitely within the ÖVP.
BZÖ chairman Jörg Haider again appeared open in all directions.
&quot;To prevent a red-black coalition, we are ready to take on the government&#39;s responsibility,&quot; Haider said.
Járóková: The vicious cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Equality Summit started today in Paris, which this year is hosted by France, the current EU Presidency.
Lívia Járóková, Member of Parliament of the European People&#39;s Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers at the expert meeting, in her message to the plenary, drew attention to segregation in education, as it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Roma children, and also the most serious obstacle to their application.
The Summit was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, and Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European organizations for the protection of rights and civic associations active in the field of equal opportunities sat down for negotiations.
According to the press office of the group of MEPs of the Fidesz movement, Járóková drew attention to the fact that, in addition to the discrimination that occurs during labor recruitment, Roma are pushed out of the European labor market mainly because of their low level of education.
&quot;The vast majority of young Roma do not have a secondary education, and due to the poor quality of primary education, only a small part of them can achieve a higher level of education.&quot;
Járóková further emphasized that education, as a basic human right, has a key role in the application of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economies of the member states of the European Union.
According to the deputy, it is necessary to strengthen the awareness of these connections in the widest circles - among Roma and non-Roma children.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the greater the chance he will have of becoming a productive member of the labor market; through income taxes and consumption taxes they contribute to the national budget.
&quot;Roma need to be guaranteed the right to quality education by virtue of their citizenship of the European Union and to guarantee the removal of their poor quality and separate education,&quot; highlighted Lívia Járóková.
According to the deputy, the cohesion of the European Union with an emphasis on the goal and action is needed in order to immediately speed up the processes of desegregation of schools, for this it is of primary importance to properly comply with existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
&quot;It is necessary to break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, it is necessary to provide Roma children with the opportunities given by the democratic space, so that they can participate in the future of Europe as full-fledged citizens,&quot; Járóková demanded.
In the sign of the &quot;European Year of Equal Opportunities&quot;, everyone is guaranteed the goal of the European Equality Summit, held annually since last year&#39;s meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum helping to achieve the goals of equality and the elimination of discrimination, set at the level of the whole of Europe and individual member states.
Fox in the henhouse
Life and health insurance companies in America often reject the possibility of concluding an insurance contract with an applicant based on people&#39;s drug purchase data.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become out of control.
&quot;There is a data protection program that binds the use of prescription data to the consent of the individual in each case.
It has to be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we&#39;re handing over the hen house to the fox,&quot; the Washington Post quoted Richard Dick, author of the prescription drug monitoring program, as saying.
Insurance companies make insurance premiums and amounts paid out in case of insured events dependent on the health status of the interested parties, and if the risk is evaluated as too great, they will not even take out insurance with him.
Previously, they sent the persons concerned for medical examinations and concluded the contract only when they knew the results.
Ten years ago, Dick came up with a much cheaper procedure: based on the identification number, the customer can easily find out from pharmacies what drugs the person in question has bought in the last year and a half, from which the program itself can deduce what kind of disease he suffers from and what his health status is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering medication, this indicates that he has virtually uncontrollably high blood fat levels, which immediately places him in a higher-risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some of which determine the risk coefficient at the same time, so the insurance company has almost no work left to do apart from the paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
Disadvantages include that some drugs can be used for several purposes, for example, some compounds are useful against migraines or hot flushes, but are also effective against depression.
From the point of view of commercial insurance companies, these represent a significant risk-increasing factor, whereas the first-mentioned problems do not.
In order to request and process the data, special companies have been created that ask the patient for permission before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies.
The authorities are now forcing them to do this, although they have not punished them for their previous negligence.
Recently, some companies have also been processing the results of laboratory examinations, which they combine with data on the drugs used, thanks to which they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, and at the same time, it will become increasingly difficult to control their use.
There is a special law for the protection of health data, but its effectiveness only applies to health service providers and insurance companies.
A bill that would give authorities the power to audit even businesses that specialize in providing data is before Congress.
Richard Dick recognizes that this is not enough: that is why he has developed his program in such a way that the transfer of data is tied to the express consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the person in question can hardly refuse permission, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
So the hens are somewhat dependent on the fox&#39;s goodwill after all.
CSU: temporary grace
The fate of the retired Huber-Beckstein duo will be decided at the end of October
Despite the shameful election debacle, heads have not yet fallen, the debate on personal issues has been postponed by the leaders of the Bavarian CSU.
Party chairman Erwin Huber and state premier Günther Beckstein can still remain in their posts, the question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent loss of votes, will be decided by an extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of the much-criticized duo have made it clear that they will not cling to their posts with all their might.
They thus tried to calm the furious members of the faction and the base, who, due to the loss of the absolute majority, demanded personal consequences the day after the &quot;Bavarian tsunami&quot;.
Five years ago - admittedly, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who was at the peak of his career - the Christian Social Union won 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, its strength was only sufficient for 43.4 percent.
The CSU was an &quot;autocrat&quot; in Bavaria, producing 18 percent of Germany&#39;s GDP, for 46 years.
Although the conservatives still have a high position in the southern federal state, which is of key importance for the Hungarian economy, they will be forced into a coalition in the future anyway.
One of the first signs of the reorganization within the party is the fact that a member of the narrow intelligence team that will begin exploratory negotiations on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, or rather with the right-wing Free Voters group, will also be the deputy chairman and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered for Huber&#39;s possible successor.
It is an irony of fate that Gabriele Pauliová, whose performance against Stoiber was used by the Huber-Beckstein duo to carry out a coup, got into the parliament on the candidate of the Free Voters, but then they made a mercilessly short trial with the ambitious communal politician.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition period, an active role will also fall to Stoiber, who until now has been spinning threads from the background, the former state premier and former chairman of the CSU called September 28 the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some scathing remarks about the CDU, saying that they would have deserved much more support from their sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel as well.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in the national success in 2005, somehow gets back on its feet.
According to Merkel, who had a hard time hiding her disappointment due to the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on Berlin&#39;s grand coalition.
Which is, of course, relative: nursing the wounded CSU will not be easier, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD achieved its weakest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6 percent.
Lukashenko: opposition - 110:0
In Sunday&#39;s elections, not a single opposition MP made it to the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability prevailing in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), by the illegalities that occurred during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the 110-member legislature of the country of 10 million has been without an opposition for well over a decade, the opposition united under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) had seriously hoped before yesterday&#39;s election that Lukashenko, who was re-elected for a fourth term in a disputed 2006 constitutional amendment his presidential mandate, this time he will &quot;allow&quot; several opposition MPs to appear in parliament.
The ODS thus abandoned the previously considered boycott.
In the background of the opposition&#39;s expectation was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which took out a loan to mitigate the impact of the ever-increasing price of Russian natural gas imports and contributed to the fact that Beltransgaz, which owns the gas pipelines passing through the country, fell into Russian hands - it wished to improve relations with the European Union, where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians are denied entry due to the Belarusian political establishment, which is rated as anti-democratic.
The relaxation was previously pointed out by the fact that the OSCE, when evaluating the pre-election campaign, emphasized positive developments, and not shortcomings - for example, the ban on the candidacy of a third of the opposition candidates.
Monday&#39;s flash report by the OSCE, however, already had reservations about the campaign, during which the opposition candidates could basically not appear in the press, especially about the fact that the opposition could not be present at the counting of votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, an improvement can be felt in the political system after all: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is willing to engage in minor confrontations with Moscow, when it continues to refuse to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which have broken away from Georgia, even though Russia, with which it forms Belarus a union state on paper, has considered these two territories to be independent for a month.
&quot;We took two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started,&quot; Alexandr Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate from the presidential elections in 2006, it is desirable that it remains so, despite the fact that &quot;the government was afraid to let a single member of the opposition into the insignificant parliament&quot;.
Looking at the results, the opposition is not planning protest actions, rather it is trying to deliver its message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
&quot;Of course we have a lot of problems with that, we have to print the opposition leaflets in Russia, distribution is hindered by local authorities, but even so I see that more and more people are supporting the change, even among the elderly,&quot; Milinkevich said, pointing out that Lukashenko&#39;s regime, who considers the creation of social security to be his greatest success, does not even consider the most officially supported class of pensioners to be correct.
&quot;Because of the country&#39;s indebtedness and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the social security &#39;inducing the silence of the cemetery&#39; collapses,&quot; judges Milinkevič.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers rated the election as democratic.
The head of mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Sergei Lebedev, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti that &quot;people do not believe in words, but in deeds&quot;, so the absence of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of the Belarusian electorate.
Global Marseille menu
The European Union and India will double their trade turnover
Since the European Union and India are each other&#39;s leading trading partners, this topic dominated the agenda of the ninth summit, along with other, mostly global, issues.
A French-Indian summit will also be held today, where it will mainly be about cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is a developing democratic power that should be given a greater opportunity to speak in international affairs, but the member countries have not yet managed to find a common denominator on the issue of supporting New Delhi&#39;s permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
This issue was not even further discussed at yesterday&#39;s, already ninth, summit held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy as the current President of the Union, respectively President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed that trade turnover would double within five years, or increase to more than one hundred billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods rose from 25 to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
As a sign of this, twenty-six already existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation were harmonized from a legal point of view, giving the green light to air transport in the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised that negotiations would be accelerated.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India&#39;s number one trading partner, New Delhi figures only in ninth place among the EU&#39;s partners.
The summit also paid attention to global issues.
Both sides condemned the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism in all its forms, and called for the urgent convening of a UN conference.
They also urged an end to the Doha round of trade negotiations, although both have played a large part in its failure so far.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate program, namely that it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least twenty percent by 2020.
India also agreed to this, as well as to the fact that next year&#39;s climate conference would require a global agreement to reduce the production of greenhouse gases by fifty percent by 2050.
Both sides would also like to prevent food prices from rising and support the convening of an international conference to analyze the financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Prime Minister will travel to the French capital, where he is going to conclude a deal on the peaceful use of atomic energy during a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that French companies will win the mandate to build Indian nuclear reactors worth twenty billion euros.
According to agency reports, the agreement should be valid for 15 years.
More than three hundred Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Large participation of Italian publishers at the international book fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will take part in the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred and one different countries for this edition, occupying 171,790 square meters of the fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles on display, with Turkey as the guest of honor.
The Deputy Minister of Culture, Francesco Maria Giro, will represent the Italian government at the inauguration ceremony in the Italian Pavilion: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Center (Punto Italia) - on 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by a meeting with the press in Room Struktur Buchmesse in Pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present figures, tendencies and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors in relation to the total Italian production is still decreasing, especially with regard to literature for children and adults.
Brunetta: &quot;Breakfast before work from now on&quot;
It is the first time in the history of Chigi Palace that a revolving door has been introduced for the arrival and departure of employees.
However, from today, this new measure against cunning people, against those who inject themselves and then go for coffee during working hours, will start working.
The news against idlers was introduced today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Mauro Masi.
&quot;The revolving door - says Brunetta - is a tool for better work, higher performance, more presence and more services,&quot; specifies the minister.
&quot;Now a new period of responsibility and transparency will open.
This is reformism&quot;, emphasizes Brunetta.
With Chigi Palace, we will complete the rollout in all buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masi, &quot;the choice of a revolving door is also important from a symbolic point of view&quot;.
There were no objections from the employees, assures the general secretary: &quot;It was a joint procedure with the workers and everyone&#39;s cooperation&quot;.
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and croissant.
The brunette smiles and says, &quot;there&#39;s nothing better than a proper cappuccino at seven in the morning&quot;.
During one conference at the Higher Vocational School for Public Administration
in Rome, the minister will finally announce that within three months the absence of public employees due to illness has decreased by 50%, that means 60,000 more people a year at work&quot;.
And he adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
&quot;its payment dynamics - the minister explains - has doubled in the last 8-10 years compared to the private sector and is far higher than the inflation rate&quot;.
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees came together to reject Brunetto&#39;s decree standards in line with a request supported by Codacons.
&quot;While the Minister for Public Administration will today present figures regarding lower absence from work due to illness - writes the consumer protection association - the nation of &#39;diligent slackers&#39; continues to grow.
In Italy we have thousands of productive and correct employees in the public administration who have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree&quot;.
On Tara, there will be a protest mainly against the exclusion of sickness allowances, which depend on activity; the extension of the time in which it is possible to check the sick person, in what time frame the check-up visits will be carried out, and against other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Occupational accidents, Napolitano: &quot;Resolute prevention&quot;
Every day in Italy, 2,500 occupational accidents occur, three people die and twenty-seven remain permanently disabled.
The values of Inail confirm that for the year 2007 we have approximately 1,200 deaths as a result of occupational accidents.
These values testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main reasons for death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
In order to reawaken the attention of institutions, social and informational means to this dramatic problem, Anmil celebrates today in all Italian regions the 58th National Day of Victims of Work Accidents, set for the second Sunday of October.
&quot;The disturbing data disseminated by Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how important the issue of occupational safety is,&quot; affirms the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Anmil, the National Association for the Crippled and Disabled for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his keen admiration for the continuous joint efforts for safety at workplaces, for the protection of injured workers, for assistance to the families of the victims and for the participation of public opinion&quot;.
&quot;Naturally, an outraged &#39;enough&#39; was raised, honestly shared in the face of tragedies that, by their scale, cause a stir in the media and the participation of public opinion, but everyday reality again presents us with dramatic cases, even repeating in their dynamics&quot;.
Napolitano does not hide that &quot;there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and awareness.
Of particular importance are the numerous initiatives promoted in the field of education, so that young people who face the world of work gain a clearer awareness.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its disturbing social significance, to apply and improve legislative norms.
For his part, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, emphasized &quot;how the phenomenon of death as a result of a work accident creates an absolutely critical social situation, how it offends the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort towards the necessary end of this situation.&quot;.
&quot;Regarding the data on occupational accidents, they seem to show a certain positive turn, but this does not deny that the number of deaths due to occupational accidents is still alarming&quot;, reiterated the president of Anmilu, Pietro Mercandelli.
&quot;We wouldn&#39;t want this &#39;reduction effort&#39; to lead to less attention, because the moment the attention stops, tragedy strikes.
&quot;We believe that generally too little is being done to stop the injury problem and there are many activities that can have an impact on the problem.
It is necessary, in our opinion - emphasized Mercandelli - to increase checks and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of training workers, right from school age&quot;.
&quot;Further efforts are still needed - he added - in terms of communication and the participation of public opinion.
But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards the phenomenon, which represents an exceptional social phenomenon&quot;.
Mercandelli finally stated that it is a progressive degeneration of the levels of the right to compensation expected for work victims and the &quot;relegation of supportive care&quot; that the system has been getting to in recent years.
&quot;So the goal is to return the insurance guarantee to the worker - he added - because the fate of those who injure themselves must not depend on spontaneity or gifting from time to time by the legislator&quot;.
Mp3 players accused, putting hearing at risk
Listening to loud music for long periods of time and using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to the announcement published today by the European Commission, which in one official report disseminated in Brussels cites the opinion of the Committee for Science on the health risks that have recently arisen and have been identified (Csrseri) Eu.
&quot;From this scientific opinion - we read in the notes - it follows that 5-10% of those who listen to music using portable music devices for at least five years, more than an hour a day per week and keep the device at high volume, risk permanent hearing loss&quot; .
&quot;It worries me that such a large number of young people, who often use portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels, can unknowingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way&quot;, admits Meglena Kuneva.
&quot;From the scientific findings - the leader continues - there is a clear risk and there is a need to react quickly.
The most important thing is that we need to encourage consumers and get this information out there.
We must continue to reexamine existing control systems in light of this scientific finding so that they become fully effective and keep pace with new technology.&quot;
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to investigate the issue, given the high use of portable music devices and the increasing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
&quot;Scientists - concluded the executive officer of the EU - confirm that there is a need to be worried and now the European Commission will examine, together with other members and parties that have raised the issue, what measures could possibly be introduced to better protect children and young people from exposure noise caused by portable musical instruments and similar devices&quot;.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100dB, but there are growing concerns about hearing damage that can be caused by overexposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to greatly reduce these damages by looking for solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee states that users of portable music devices, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for just five hours a week, exceed the currently valid limits corresponding to the maximum permissible noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for an extended period of time risk permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be calculated between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno will let the Commission for the future of the capital run free
We will start today, we will close in March, we will have the amounts in June.
Such is the calendar given by Campidoglio to the workers of the &quot;Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome&quot;, which met this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the commission will compile handbooks for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will evaluate the analyzes and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the &quot;official stamp&quot; of Campidoglio and his councilor Gianni Alemanno.
&quot;The commission is completely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are included there - wants to emphasize Alemanno - It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which will ultimately be used by the political arbitrators, who remain Giunta e Municipal Council.
There is no exchange of functions, but only an effort to have some place to process a large project for Rome.
In March, the work will be completed and then it will be dissolved, because this institution must have an exact time limit.
In June - announces the mayor - we will present a strategic plan and use the work done by the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome&quot;.
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: &quot;Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of their proposals.
If they are of good quality, like the proposals of the Attali Commission, and I am sure of that in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often politics gets wasted on day-to-day problems and emergencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wants to emphasize that &quot;this Commission is neither a useless undertaking nor a bluff: it is completely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a single euro and will serve to reflect and involve the best intelligence that the capital has&quot;.
For Alemanno, in essence, &quot;it is necessary to have a strategic outline as a starting point, neither definitive nor immobile, to allow our city to rise authentically to the level it desperately needs and to think with a united spirit about its future.&quot;.
A future which, the mayor of Rome clarifies, &quot;will not be limited only to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further&quot; not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as the capital, but &quot;will also include the role that Rome can and must perform as the main city of Europe and the Mediterranean&quot;.
Obama? The first anti-American president. You already know why
One well-known American president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: &quot;Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.&quot;
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions decimated the US economy and maintained relations (as he still does today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam&quot;.
Attacks against Obama are mounting just as the election date approaches.
One lady from Miami wrote on the website: &quot;This guy is full of ambition.
But Obama has the audacity: he thinks he&#39;s going to get the highest office in a nation that had two governors and five black senators everywhere!&quot;.
In reality, these attacks don&#39;t say much&quot;; they are clearly racial attacks and do not answer the voters&#39; question: will he be a good president? And then we have the polls; they all say Obama will win, and by a wide margin.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
One newspaper from Mississippi, from the heart of the South of the United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the voting booth, we know well who the American patriot will vote for.
One side of the American mentality, which remained Scythian until the last moment, will come to the surface.
Say what you want, in the end we&#39;ll take care of it ourselves, who to check, Obama or McCain&quot;.
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, the success of a black candidate seems almost certain.
But despite all these considerations for the Democrats, the main weapon is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his term? Eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost fifty thousand soldiers and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
4,500 soldiers lost their lives in Iraq and the Americans were not forced to pack up.
And yet Iraq has become Bush&#39;s weakness for most.
Whoever takes Georgia W&#39;s place will have a huge task.
The economic collapse of the USA was also felt by journalists: there is a period of investigation in newspapers. And many blame the Internet, the &quot;killer&quot; of print.
The PEW Research Center asked five hundred journalists about the state of their profession and their outlook for the future.
Well, today almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, those surveyed did not openly say they had less credibility concerns.
They don&#39;t feel as isolated as they once did.
The problem for American journalists is the money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, the room where the editors work to put the newspaper together, are a huge problem.
According to the interviewed journalists, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism as understood by the general public to fundamentally change.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades American journalists.
Six out of ten print journalists and senior executives believe journalism is headed down the wrong path nationally.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
Larger publishers are making their way to the Internet, which many see as the &quot;killer&quot; of print.
&quot;Economic coercion&quot;, which journalists point out, has increased by up to 79%.
Five hundred journalists interviewed admitted that they resort to technology in the hope that it will &quot;do something good&quot; for their journalism.
The biggest divide in American journalism is between those who run the newsrooms — that is, the executives — and the reporters who work for them.
56% of leaders at the national level are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the value drops to 23%.
This has to do with &quot;job security&quot; for someone.
Nationally, 47% of managers think they will lose their job within three years.
As for journalists, they range at 30%.
As for &quot;certain work&quot; regarding the staff (our editors, ndr) in America it is still the order of the day.
Only 13% of journalists work on contract.
In a nation as huge as the US, with three hundred million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, so it&#39;s a matter of take it or leave it.
Executives are almost always paid huge salaries, and an editor can earn as much as ten thousand dollars a month in addition to pension and insurance.
As for vacations, the argumentation becomes more complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year until reaching fifteen days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, by their own admission, often fall ill within a year.
It&#39;s just a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the submission of the real estate entrepreneur Daniel Coppola, who asked to be able to move from his town, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in connection with a counteroffer for the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at his own expense, he was released from house arrest last week, which was converted into a mandatory permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, requested that the real estate entrepreneur be allowed to change his residence from a country town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (against which pm spoke) would allow him to influence his company and get access to the evidence that incriminates him.
Elites in danger
This phenomenon was already evident a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the $700 billion bailout plan presented by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is also confirmed by yesterday&#39;s New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis is splitting the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, more moderate, friendly to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which is, on the contrary, conservative, hostile against &quot;those from Washington&quot; and against the world of finance, especially strong in the states in the middle part and in the south..
The soul that arrogantly manifested itself with the vote I spoke of at the beginning..
However, this thing just quoted is just an example of the changes, the big changes, which the current economic earthquake is already showing: not only in the United States, but in the entire West, and perhaps not only here.
In both the US and Europe, this crisis seems to be acting as an accelerator of long-incubating phenomena that are intensifying in the new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the reactualization, the extraordinary revival of the market, the dual category of State-power in relation to a certain renationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking and financial institutions, which of course have strong ties abroad, but in which the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state, are included to the greatest extent.
Which created at the same time a political problem for those who run it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis appears to be economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be largely out of the game or to have nothing much to add: the obvious proof was given by the European Union, which is divided as always between different interests and different state strategies and which cannot decide on a common political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each individual state, rescue plans, market recovery, new rules and, above all, the distribution of funds: the moment we get into trouble, only the states have the economic means, the amount of financial resources, to be able to try to put everything into ok
And they also possess the necessary means and authority to use them: two resources of immense value, under certain circumstances, which perhaps no market and no international organization will ever be able to command to a similar degree.
This new emphasis, which the crisis places on the state-national element, is, after all, in complete harmony with the ever-increasing importance which attempts to attribute recent economic progress to one factor closely connected with it: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of networks, increasingly sophisticated technology, immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to rule the world, we suddenly realized that our future would have to be the opposite to deal more and more with such little intangible things as water, grain, diesel.
All things, who would have said it, can be transported from one place on earth to another, but in each case they are connected, absolutely, to a bounded space, a territory.
So, whoever becomes their ruler certainly has a lot more cards up his sleeve than whoever isn&#39;t, and whoever has the misfortune of living in a place with no grain, no diesel, and no water.
I come to the second piece of news, which, however, predicts a turning point.
Whoever talks about the territory, the state, the government, inevitably talks about politics, that is, about leadership.
Taking into account the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena seem to be forming.
On the one hand, the realization that there is an objective need for authoritative leadership, a request for someone who could take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit towards the existing leaderships, especially the economic ones, which turned out to be equally unsatisfactory and full of dark places.
And together something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: the discredit, the impatience, the sense of incompetence and absence that tries to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
For it seems that the belief is spreading more and more among the broad masses of the population, rather than their actions being the same as the thoughts of the hitherto popular elite, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite have already outgrown their time and are indifferent to the opinions of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership feeds one branch from underground, but the strong movement to eliminate the ruling classes and the traditional political order manifests itself in sudden electoral &quot;revolts&quot; or in unexpected changes in collective moods in recent and most recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the fall of Labor in Great Britain, to the revolt of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it).
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligentsia, some would say their format, have more and more problems understanding, i.e. representing, which, not from today, is created in deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is re-invigorating, expanding, potentially over-exaggerating.
Before this, it would be an exaggeration to talk about a permanent &quot;mass revolt&quot;.
But we certainly can&#39;t say that it means keeping your eyes wide open.
Super glue for walking on walls
Defy the laws of gravity with super glue and walk on walls like Spiderman in the future.
This is the object of various American research centers, and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
The scientists managed to keep the 100-kilogram body stuck to a vertical wall using a sticker measuring only 2.5 centimeters square.
STUDY - The American magazine Science published the discoveries of some researchers of the University of Dayton, in Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is a development of already existing materials that use a special structure of carbon called carbon dwarf tubes.
&quot;We can imagine the base of the adhesive as a series of tubes laid out like an orderly pile of spaghetti,&quot; explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The researchers were inspired by the gecko&#39;s feet, which are covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to ensure a perfect grip.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, showed that the new glue is ten times stronger than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time &quot;simply peels off the wall&quot;, explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton School of Engineering.
WALKING ON WALLS? -&quot;This material could be useful as a temporary adhesive,&quot; adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk on walls like Spiderman? Perhaps so, but the researchers are thinking of a far less fascinating use as connecting electrical devices, since the dwarf carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could be in aerospace engineering.
No super heroes yet.
FURTHER RESEARCH - The University of Berkley, California, is also researching a new adhesive.
In one article in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, Californian researchers presented an adhesive formed from hair-like micro-fibers that clean themselves of dust by moving across the surface to still maintain a perfect fit.
Medicines: never with juices
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are mainly consumed in summer because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, together with some life-saving drugs, their ingestion changes the enhancement or reduction of the effectiveness with serious health consequences.
To emphasize the dangers of juices, both ready-made and fresh, in combination with the ingestion of certain drugs, David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, is raising a new alarm at the current 263rd national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: one glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some life-saving drugs, to nullify their beneficial effects and put patients&#39; health at risk.
Grapefruit juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to toxic levels the effects of some antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs.
DRUGS AT RISK - The Italian Medical Agency itself announced this in a newsletter two years ago, urging doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers of this mixture and to be careful what they drink if they are taking drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT - According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that suppress drugs.
A long list of effects dampened by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the challenge of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: &quot;Such discoveries are usually immediately reported to the various international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which eventually arrange and exchange the information instructions of the drugs.
So always read the explanatory leaflets of the medicines you get and if you come across something unclear, don&#39;t worry, but ask a doctor or pharmacist for clarification», emphasized the expert for the Ansa agency.
Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokenyan who teaches at Priceton University and is a well-known New York Times editor.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of the foreign, economic and political actions of the Bush administration.
A few months after the September 2001 assassinations, in the days of Enron&#39;s collapse, Krugman predicted in an op-ed in the New York Times that the second event would be far more important than the first in terms of consequences for the history of the United States.
A prediction which caused quite a bit of controversy and which he was criticized for years, but which turned out to be accurate.
«I am surprised and shocked at the speed with which collapses like Enron and Worldcom have disappeared from public interest, Krugman declared in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is &quot;an economist of great importance», but also a popularizer who has &quot;a very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excesses of the Bush liberal administration».
Open Office, here we have the third edition of the package &quot;anti-Microsoft»
It&#39;s the release day of Open Office.org 3.0, an open source package of personal production that aims to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the better-known Microsoft Office.
After about a year of work by volunteer workers, controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is presented to the general public with various novelties: to the welcome screen and the revised and improved opening window, other, far more important ones are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new of the ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest ISO standard version.
Emphasis is also placed on cooperation with the Office 2007 package, Open Office is able to open a document with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special functions of some models, such as the one that allows you to reduce the dimensions of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for transmission by electronic means, or the possibility to transfer the PDF file to the graphic design model and preserve the original appearance of the page.
Still from this point of view, we can create &quot;PDF hybrid&quot; documents that resemble the typical graphics of the Adobe format and have the properties of a spreadsheet or word program.
Collaboration is an element that has received many improvements inside the application programs: in Excel it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text program each collaborator is assigned one color for comments to make identification clearer in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working on the transfer of some Open Office functions to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should rebuild the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, it was added to the English version, which is on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD can also be sent to your home or workplace upon request.
And if the topic of free of charge can be a draw for expansion in households, it is precisely in the business area of Open Office that the package bets a lot, and can already count on various projects implemented in public administration and in schools.
And there are also offers of training, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress for Powerpoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, after all, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and when we consider that today we are at almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of a new version it is possible that this projected number can be exceeded.
Kohl&#39;s results are also positive, it is the fourth case of doping
A new positive case at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, third classified and winner of the top climber&#39;s shirt.
The news was quoted by the newspaper L&#39;Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth competitor to test positive for Cera, the third-generation Epo, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl&#39;s blood samples are in line with those performed in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the control analyzes confirm the positive at the Cer, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to face the stipulated two years of disqualification.
The news about Kohl&#39;s positivity to Epo of the third generation is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had already informed the Austrian government authorities about the result.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, he also won the dotted T-shirt of the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS: THE NEW YORK TIMES WONDER IS ITALY RACIST?
Italy &quot;as a country of emigrants only in the last house transformed into a preferred destination of immigrants&quot; received with resistance.
Does this turn a beautiful country into a nation of racists? That&#39;s what they ask in a long article in the New York Times, which devoted this article to the debate on racism in Italy, starting with the case of a young man from Burkina Faso, Abdul William Guibre, killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case makes visible what the New York Times defines as the &quot;paradox of the north&quot;: the northern regions are simultaneously those where &quot;more integration and more work&quot; are registered, but also &quot;the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the strongest support for the Northern League&quot;.
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
Also, new legislation demanded by Lego, which seeks to curb immigration and make it easier to deport illegal immigrants, is cited as an example of Italy&#39;s changing climate.
A tendency emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: &quot;Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedict XVI in the Quirinale, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism&quot;.
The plane of Steve Fossett, the millionaire who disappeared a year ago, has been found
The wreckage of Steve Fossett&#39;s plane, the millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris was discovered on a plateau at an altitude of three thousand meters above sea level, in the Mammoth Lakes region of the Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the plane.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson dispelled any lingering doubts: &quot;The plane has been found, we&#39;ve sent a team out there, and now we&#39;re confident that this is the exact plane that Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared,&quot; he said at a news conference. conference.
The sheriff specified that no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been presumed dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) announced that an investigative team was dispatched a few hours after the wreckage was identified, and it finally identified the plane: it was exactly Bellanco 8kcab, missing since Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada on a three-hour flight on September 3, 2007 .
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett&#39;s personal items were found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
They are two documents with Fossett&#39;s name on them, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, for cash and one jacket.
The search for Fossett was called off a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire earned a place in history thanks to a long collection of firsts.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a trip around the world in a hot air balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a plane without landing.
Among his many records is also a flight at an altitude of 15,445 meters, over the Andes, albeit with a co-pilot.
Glk, an ad you don&#39;t expect
One unusual Suv with an original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk from the &quot;compact&quot; jeeps of the house of the star, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring a whirlwind of innovations to this sector.
Thanks to its non-traditional processing, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk on the market and which will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17 will be unexpected and unconventional.
In this way, the advertising campaign that will accompany the debut of the new vehicle will start an unofficial way of communication also thanks to a futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which is thus used for the first time in Italy for a car brand.
Divided into three different phases, the maxi poster project will dominate Milan&#39;s main shopping street, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and with the help of special glasses that will be distributed near the Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real dimensions and in a three-dimensional format.
Indeed, when you look at the picture, you will have the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different moments in all its details, then recomposed into a single image.
Without a doubt, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new to the stereotypical area of automotive communication with this ad.
Will he succeed in arousing the interest of future customers in this way? We&#39;ll see.
So now we know who the Italian hooligans are
From Trivenet, they risk Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the &quot;Ultras Italia&quot; group who have been following the Nazionale azzurra for years and who, truth be told, have never caused too much trouble until now.
She never even met the opposing fans.
The orientation of the group is right-wing.
The founders come from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia they were joined by groups (actually few groups) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricolor flags showing the cities of origin of the participants: they removed them on Saturday night so as not to be recognized.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found true Nazi fans, Levsky.
Figc made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all in name, so easy to check.
And Viminale really checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with an ongoing Dasl, no one who was banned from visiting the stadiums.
Four Blues fans who had previous offenses from the stadium were refused a ticket and banned from the match.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports that will come from the Bulgarian police, then he will take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for five years at least to the fans who were arrested or those who were identified during the riots.
The international Daspo, which forbids visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, won&#39;t set foot in a single stadium anymore.
Good luck.
But now there is a fear of emulation: that is, more will be added to the more than one hundred and fifty.
&quot;We must immediately put out this fire and not justify those who behave in this way&quot;, confirm from Viminal.
So, &quot;eyes wide open, mainly because of the national match on Wednesday in Lec&quot;.
It is in Puglia that there is a small core of supporters.
Osservatorio will meet tomorrow, on Tuesday Casms, which can also count with one part of Aise, is a secret service that takes care of problems in stadiums.
&quot;Choir Leader-Leader and outstretched arm during Mameli anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...&quot;.
Such is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in a really unhappy way), who has been the director of the Viminal Osservatorio for a few weeks (taking over the position previously held by Francesco Tagliente and then by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously a bursar in Trieste, home to the core of Ultras Italia supporters, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the leader, but of course the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a shame.
&quot;I&#39;m not a sociologist - adds Observatory number one - crimes are attributed to the country in which they happened.
So far this group has stayed within limits, now we will take a good look at what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let&#39;s also talk about whistling during Mameli&#39;s anthem: it&#39;s not a crime either, but it&#39;s bad manners, if you&#39;ll allow me...&quot;.
Students victims of expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students knows no crisis.
According to the latest research by Sunio, the tenants&#39; union, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
&quot;The phenomenon has already reached such proportions that whole classes of students have lost the right to study because of the overall too high prices that their families would have to bear - explains the head of the office for Sunia studies, Laura Mariani - in this city, the high demand from students has distorted the market in such a way that it stimulated the process of price increases, which also spread to residents&quot;.
In most cases, rental offers contain several violations: open contracts, unregistered, no limited rent, associated subleases.
An exceptional intervention is needed for Sunji, which could regulate prices through a tax overhaul.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, about 450 euro is needed for a single bed, for a single room you pay from a minimum price of 650 (Zone Bande Nere) to an average value of 800 (Zone Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) up to a maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed costs on average 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in zones close to the university, 250/280 euros are needed for a bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single room.
In Rome in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, piazza Bologna) they want roughly 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double bed.
Prices are a little lower (550 euros for a single bed) in zones close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We save only if we move to the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in the zones of Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples, a bed costs about 300/450 euros, a room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari they want 250/350 euro for a bed, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have a greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where the most common phenomenon is rent for students from countries outside the European Union, one more anomaly is finally noticed: an increase of about 25-30% of the fee they want for foreign students compared to Italian ones.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema, cities are canceling historic theaters
Historical cinema theaters are closing in favor of the Multiplex.
&quot;A city without cinemas is like a blind person, it&#39;s like a face without eyes.&quot;
The picture offered by the director Giuseppe Tornator successfully documents what is happening in the big Italian urban centers, but also in the country towns.
The process of limiting cinemas, the birth of large multiplexes in the suburbs and the subsequent demise of monoscreens in the central zones of cities, is one of the events that seems inevitable and irreversible, but it also has all the signs of a real cultural crime.
Historical places full of memories often disappear, &quot;it&#39;s like losing a friend, an acquaintance with whom we shared part of the journey and a lot of emotions&quot;, feels the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won Tornator an Oscar and a grand jury prize in Cannes, and which told the poetry of a village cinema and the sadness of a way of life that cinema has probably lost forever.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years, 316 cinemas of the traditional tip have closed their doors, and the highest bill was paid mainly by theaters in the most important cities: by 10 less in Florence, by 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, by 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by closures, Emilia-Romagna is in first place with the loss of 82 cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And the proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the arrival of the multiplex are precisely these three Italian regions that registered the highest number of new cinema multiplexes: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna .
«The Italian procedure has developed irrationally», says Paolo Protti, president of Anec, &quot;it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the existing ones will survive, because if one cinema in the city closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to multiplex.
Then let&#39;s not even talk about the insufficient subsidy for the fund in favor of the operators: the previous state debt is roughly 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
Between 16 and 18 million euros per year would be needed to support the sector».
The case of Bologna is interesting, the first Italian city to be concerned about closures and which decided to find a way out by signing a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in historic centers and in the suburbs.
Among the planned norms are steps in tax relief in favor of operators and benefits for the audience in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the zone with limited traffic and will have special prices for stopping and in some car parks.
«I like this initiative» says Giuseppe Tornatore&quot;and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures».
However, it is certain that in order to stand up to the might of the multiplex, traditional theaters need to improve their sound and image quality, as today&#39;s audiences are more demanding.
The defense of the traditional cinema is a topic that has always been important: the closing of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to found the &quot;New Cinema Paradiso&quot;, which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the already closed Rialto or Quirinal in Via Nazionale, where I shared so many emotions so that I don&#39;t have to look at the inscriptions blackened by dust, I turn the other way».
Links between politics and the &#39;ndrangheta mafia group, mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
&quot;The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adjust the municipal elections according to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group&quot;.
The charges that the Anti-Mafia Directorate in Calabria are bringing against the mayor and vice-mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno, Carlo Martelli, jailed this morning for external collaboration with a mafia organization, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, a lawyer, namesake of the boss, already accused of committing crimes of a mafia nature, sentenced to pay 10 million euros, are also in irons.
&quot;They ignored all legal and moral norms, as well as common sense,&quot; state prosecutors wrote, when two local governments expressed their willingness to pay attorney Piromalli to consult.
&quot;Thus, they would allow the mafia group - write the judges - to officially enter the city authorities and facilitate the already huge possibilities of control and management of the public administration&quot;.
The president of the Calabrian regional commission, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that &quot;collusions between local institutions and the organized criminal underworld are many in his region: &quot;There are areas in which the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others, where collusions are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of the &#39;ndrangheta, heroes who are still unblemished&quot;.
This morning&#39;s arrests follow those in July last year in which police showed the final blow to the Piromalli mafia group.
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioii Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, the reason was even then the supposed connection between organized crime and the local administration - local politicians have been deprived of their functions in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chairman of the Christian Democrats, who at the time of the dissolution was elected head of the centre-right coalition after a narrow election in May.
He cried out over the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called the then deputy interior minister Marco Minniti to account, accusing him of masterminding everything for political reasons, but the judges explain in a prison order signed this morning that the mafia group even went so far as to request a change to the A3 motorway project.
From further interrogations ordered against Dal Torrion, public prosecutors write, it became clear &quot;a willingness to transfer the claims of a businessman, a representative of a larger group very close, as is generally known, to Piromalli and to adapt public administration elections to the interests of the mafia group.&quot;.
When energy is born from waves, the big ones come into play.
It is an endless deposit that covers more than 70% of the earth&#39;s surface and is now being discovered by the world&#39;s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, tides are new sources of inexhaustible energy, on which the eyes of giants like Chevron have caught their eye, which are now trying to get their hands on these sources.
The possibility of generating energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for more than a hundred years, and in the 1970s, in connection with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil dropped around 1980, the idea of using marine energy fell by the wayside. But now environmental organizations and a new increase in the price of oil have given the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London stated in 2007 that approximately 15 percent of the world&#39;s electricity consumption could be met by harnessing the movement of ocean waves.
this amount would be twice the energy that is currently produced in nuclear power plants.
In addition, there are currents and tides.
The giants attack.
the company that bet on marine energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When this plan was announced, it seemed like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more and more companies are betting on marine energy rather than conventional energy.
&quot;Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies - a spokesperson for one company linked to the US oil giant told the economic daily Wall Street Journal - and they are thinking about the possibility of working with us&quot;.
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary for the start-up of a project on the use of marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially when we consider that it is in Alaska that the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush came up with a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. is also pursuing a marine energy footprint. From New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, and the amounts invested so far, although not known in detail, indicate growing interest, according to observers.
Technology that needs to be developed.
Experts say the technology is still in its infancy because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
So far, the facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small in size and do not appear to cause major problems for the ecosystem.
However, for greater energy production, it is necessary to use technologies with a greater impact on the environment.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of battles that are interconnected.
The force of the waves, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure inside these buoys with the help of cylinders and cylinders.
The pressure spins the turbine, which supplies power to the generator.
Power is brought ashore by submarine cables.
For now, there are four devices of this type in the project phase, which are only waiting for federal approval, and part of the energy could be used for military purposes.
Conversely, Verdant Power already generates power for a shopping center and parking lot using six subsea turbines in New York&#39;s East River.
The movement of the water during the ebb and flow causes the turbines to rotate, which in turn feed the generator.
Verdant commented that they have a long list of clients who are waiting for the necessary authorizations for the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the tide.
Of particular interest at this point is the tidal potential, say the Electric Power Research Institute.
Although a discontinuous factor, tides are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
States such as New York, Maine and Alaska, along with other coastal states, already invested 7.5 million dollars in 2008 and predicted investments of up to 35 million dollars for 2009 in tidal energy.
