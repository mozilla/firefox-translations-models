Barack Obama to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize as America's fourth president
US President Barack Obama arrives in Oslo, Norway, for a 26-hour time to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth American president in history.
He will receive a diploma, a medal and a $1.4 million cheque for, among other things, for exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The White House chief of staff will arrive in the Norwegian capital in the morning with his wife, Michelle, and he will be busy.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with five members of the committee selected from 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
The presidential couple then have a scheduled meeting with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony at which Obama will receive the prestigious awards.
He will win him as America's fourth president, but only the third to win the award directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghan war when embracing the award.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he realizes that he is accepting the award as the president, who is currently at war in two countries.
He increased the war effort a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which will be remembered to be stressed by any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to give those to charitable causes, but he has not yet decided on a particular charity.
The packed program will then be taken by the president and his wife to a banquet, where, in addition to the King of Norway and the Queen, the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests will be invited.
Obama was more restrained from the start to price.
He said, for example, that he felt that he did not fully deserved it.
He also reiterated several times that it was not just a prize for him, but for all those who strive for the same values as him.
He said immediately after the announcement that they would be "challered for action" for him.
Conservationist accused of extortion
Litoměřice police have charged the chairman of the civic association Society of Conservation of Conservation of Conservation Litoměřice with blackmail.
In several cases in the past year, he has appealed to some building proceedings, demanding money from investors for his benefit for his benefit to withdraw the appeal, said Litoměřice police spokeswoman Alena Romová.
The chairman of the Litoměřice Society of Conservation of Nature is Lubomír Studnička.
He is now in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
The sorting containers of Brno don't really smell
In Prague, ordinary people can sort with beverage packaging, in South Moravian villages you will find sorting containers at every turn.
And in Brno?
There to reserve a few minutes before you find the appropriate bins.
I don't want to say that the waste in Brno would not be arranged at all.
But it seems to me that we are the second largest city in the Republic, the councillors are insufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the jungle league of waste sorting not only by being able to throw only paper, glass and plastics into the sorting containers here, but above all by the number of bins for such waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a PET bottle in the collection bin in the center?
It's a complete trick, it just takes time and steady nerves.
The only place I have come to have come to be at the Moravian Square opposite Potrefené Huse.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and my colleagues be mad at me, but I don't find it a hell of a lot.
Not to mention that in other parts, there is no honey sorting of waste.
Many of my friends prefer not to sort the waste.
Out of laziness.
They're far from the garbage cans.
I don't blame them.
I volunteered myself after the party to throw away a few glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colorful garbage cans on Kounicova Street in the foreseeable future.
Luckily, on the way to the shala, I came across the right place.
But the garbage from it was overflowing.
After all, this is still the centre of Brno that perhaps represents the city the most, is it?!
But ecology and some aesthetics are probably not of much interest to the Brno socialists.
They would rather buy the city a hockey extra league, which will embarrass us all over the country than buy a few extra containers and offer to sort out other ingredients for cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my conjecture with official statistics after a few moments of surfing on the internet.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst off in the whole South Moravian Region.
"Paroubka's" budget took money for pensions and sick pay
After the left has added to farmers or officials in the government's view, the budget does not have to have money for pensions, sick pay, or building savings.
But also to interest on the national debt or international lawsuits.
It will add problems to those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists advocated the increase for some groups, they relied on sensitive spending, pensions, or sick pay to borrow the government afterwards. "It's just postponing the problems to the future, laying mines," says Janota.
The money borrowed is paid for more and more interest and must come back at some point.
There's not much to choose from to get it, the state isn't supposed to.
If they do not reduce welfare or costs for the running of the state, they must raise taxes.
To all to whom the left has now added: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later, their children.
People don't have to worry about pensions or sick pay, from whose account 1.8 billion have gone, they get to them.
But at the cost of the state taking more debt – next year, this will not miss only $163 billion in the coffers, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will thus rise faster and faster, and with it the cost of interest.
The state will need the money to pay it, and it will no longer be enough to increase VAT slightly or reduce the maternity allowance, as the government did in its anti-idepress (ISET) package.
The money's move in favor of several groups of voters will also miss five billion next year to build highways and railways.
These are mainly already tendered and set-up sections that will not be reprocessed to re-export and possibly discounted.
Preserving the most, which is also not free.
It means a delay or halt to 30 large buildings, the use of European money is also at risk, warns Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed to solve the loss of the money in Solomon, to reach into CEZ's dividends, which the state mostly owns, and from them to add the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, and it is certainly not a bottomless source.
Last year, CZK 18 billion came to the budget from CEZ.
Every year, dividend charges are paid for the disposal of environmental damage, which are supplemented by a pension account or serve as a reserve for the forthcoming pension reform.
Moreover, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP.
But the carnival of the movements do not stop there.
Nearly three billion were reduced in the budget for various compensation to the victims of communism and crimes, or the spending on lawsuits, even building savings.
Whether the state can do without this money is uncertain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international case, we'll have to pay for it anyway, Janota says.
The minister will then have to save money inside the resort or, in the worst case, reach for the government's budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the already run-up to the $2 billion Treasury project to allow online to watch what the authorities are spending.
The first stage will start in January.
If the Chancellor of the Exchequer did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped, sanctions will come, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
In the future, Americans are counting on a mobile phone, on which the user will switch between different operating systems at the touch of a single button.
The unveiled plans sound promising.
Just press one key and from Windows Mobile you will be transported to Android in seconds.
This is precisely the possibility that is aimed at the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to run two user profiles at once on your mobile.
You can switch between them, you can split them into home and business.
Both will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware suggested in an interview with Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and was first performed a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, on which the Windows Mobile and Android systems were running alongside each other.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and American operators to test smartphone virtualization testing, and the devices are expected to reach customers during 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains plagues hoteliers
The bare slopes are not only worried about the Krkonoše toilers.
The lack of snow discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That is why, in the Giant Mountains, you can still get available rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Attendance on our website is a big one.
People are going through offers, surveying prices, but so far they are afraid to order in a binding way.
And if they're calling to us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be on the snow or on the mud," said the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want a New Year's Eve stay in Špindlerův Mlýn exactly according to their wishes should not hesitate to order any more.
Whoever prefers saving money and the quality of accommodation is only second to none, he can still try to wait a few days.
Spindleruv hoteliers have so far offered mostly weekly stays on New Year's Eve.
I think they'll try to turn them in for a while, but then they, too, will give up and go for a shorter time.
And then the available rooms will dwindle quickly," Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter dates are still offered by the Ingtours travel agency.
Now we're most interested in the Christmas week, which is not sold out yet.
Still half of the seats on offer remain free.
That's why we've already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute," said Ingtoursu director Petr Schiefert.
New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains can still offer a Vrchlabí travel agency, but there are fewer vacancies.
It also goes well for the first fortnight in February, with the remaining winter dates sold on average.
This year, interest in winter stays is negatively affected by the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to see if he'll think.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy during the week, Christmas will also be sold out," Schiefert says.
On the contrary, it is a little better than last year to occupy the rooms of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Snezkou.
We're about five percent better.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas we have the last few places.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in January and February is also selling well," said the director of the best kilky hotel, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of New Year's Eve stays are also booked by the Omnia Hotel at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, at Christmas, half of the beds available remain in the latest Janskolázeň hotel.
We were pleasantly surprised by January this year, which we already have about sixty per cent occupied at this point.
February is a little weaker so far, but as soon as the snow falls, interest in stays in the Giant Mountains will definitely rise even further, said the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
On a larger snowfall, however, the Krkonoše hoteliers have to let go of their appetite.
Thursday is to be cooled, if there are any precipitation, so the mountains should be snowy.
But then the warming is to come again, Jiří Jakubský informed the Hradec workplace of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repeation is the mother of wisdom
It is comical with the timekeeping efforts of Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest, is echoing in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself considered the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his longed-awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had copied it over a copycat from Bush's Iraqi script three years earlier.
Not only does he use phrase "as in Iraq" phrase several times in the text itself, but he did not hesitate to even use the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the title of his own declaration: "The new way forward."
Three years ago, he himself criticized Bush's idea of sending fresh military reinforcements to Iraq plagued by civil war as "irresponsible and in his aftermath of a catastrophic decision."
But the ensuing months have shown that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field commanders, was the only one possible and highly successful enough that Iraq is not mentioned at all in the news relames today.
Bush's reputation was unfulfilled, but objectively left his successor a much more gratifying initial situation than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
He was again asked to increase the military contingent by the field commanders, in particular the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even harshly criticized the reluctant White House shooters in defiance of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn't get anything better, so at least he cheated the general out of 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to wrestle the promise of another 5,000 from Europe, although he had originally planned at least 10.
The most problematic of Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in as little as 18 months and end this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than answers.
Many doubt that the half-hearted increase will bear the same fruit as the advance in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, with its leaders honoring the bargain.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the opposite symptom - no one can be relied upon and no agreements are respected.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces are being prepared ill as they are, accustomed to changing the master as they do, depending on how convenient it is.
Political institutions, even if formally founded, will remain a Potemkin village, beyond which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to be rampant.
The export of interests of different ethnic groups is unusually complex, given the confusion of circumstances that are further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even building a "accessor state," which is a minimalist goal of the operation, doesn't seem very real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy is puzzled by his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the brink of an explosion.
Believing that the soldiers sent to the turmoil of war for the purpose of "granting home" will be caused by a miracle made here, only a truly romantic, reality-doctile can only be a truly romantic, reality-docked.
Politically, setting the date for troop withdrawal is sheer irresponsible, as the Taliban will see it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans' willingness to take part in combat operations in Afghanistan is huddled with the red.
European politicians do not, nor do they want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the foothills of Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of intervening radically in the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the intensified sanctions do not affect the Iranians, the uproaring question will be of a towering question before the United States to avoid attempting to solve the problem with military force.
It will need to be answered at a time when, according to Obama, America will proceed with the victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will also mark a dramatic turn in the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Barack Obama is that there are three years left in the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time to come up with another strategy if this proves to be a total flop.
Goldman Sachs executives no longer get cash rewards
Senior executives at US Bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash rewards this year.
This was announced by the company, which is responding to harsh criticism of its wage practices.
Instead of money, the group of 30 leading executives will receive shares that can be sold in five years at the earliest.
In addition, the shares can be taken away from managers if they take excessive risks.
Goldman Sachs is thus leading the effort to combine Wall Street rewards with long-term performance, according to Reuters.
I believe that Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to take, said former JPM investment banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs came under criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion (nearly $300 billion) in rewards in the first three quarters of this year.
The total remuneration in the company for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today.
High rewards in the banking sector, with the rise of the financial crisis, have become a hot political issue in a number of countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intends to impose bonuses on bankers in excess of £25,000 (around £712,000) a one-time tax on a 50% tax.
Similar steps are being prepared by France.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics
The record-breaking five women in Stockholm today took over from the hands of King Carl XVI of Sweden. Gustaf of this year's Nobel Prize in professional categories and for literature.
Among them were the four female scientists, the Romanian-born German writer Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, for research in chromosome.
The Chemistry Prize went to the Israelica Ada Jonath, along with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for clarifying the structure and functions of the ribats.
The final laureate was the Nobel Prize in Economics, which was won by American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for economic management analyses.
The only professional category to do without the holder this year was physics.
This award was won today by scientists Charles Kao for Fibre Fibre Research, and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the Invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical telescopes.
Each of the awards received a diploma, a Nobel Medal and a certificate of financial reward.
This for each category amounts to ten million Swedish kronor (roughly $25 million).
If there are more honorees in each of them, they share the reward between them.
The traditionally most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize was received earlier this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, by US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his awards, as he is only at the beginning of his career and, moreover, heads a country that leads two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But he added in the defense of his policy that wars are in some situation necessary to fight for peace, even if the price is high for it.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning in Finance Minister Eduardo Janota, who is considering staying in the government because he disagrees with the shape of next year's state budget as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is expected that the budget and perhaps Janot's stay in the cabinet will be the topics of their Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too high, which further exacerbates the public-purpose crisis.
The meeting was reported by the president's spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to discuss his continued tenure with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
Under the Budget Act, which will now be given to Klaus for signing, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
But the House on Wednesday agreed to the left's proposals for money transfers and increased money for the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the Social Democrat proposals for hastily increasing the budget deficit.
A sharp domestic political dispute arose between the left on one and the government, Klaus, and the right on the other, over the opposite of the left, which is beginning to cast out a question mark over the further action of Fischer's clerical cabinet, which was agreed by the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party in the spring.
Critics argue that the budget as adopted by the House is essentially destroying the package of austerity measures that Fischer's government pushed through in the fall, which it says is to stop the state's debt.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the state budget bill, said at today's discussion breakfast with businessmen that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "sustainable deficit" of public finances.
Today, he says, he has no good solution.
Only a strong government could be improved, with a broader consensus among the political parties, the president.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek said the budget was terrifying and the government should consider continuing to exist.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas told the Czech Press Agency that the concept of a clerical cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "strong statements."
The head of the ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, responded to Topolánek by saying that the budget deficit that the former Topolánek government had prepared for this year and which will exceed CZK 200 billion is horrifying.
Already on Wednesday, the ČSSD called the approval of the state budget for next year a success.
Satisfied were also the people.
Mandela was played by Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's news
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: Undefeated tells the world a lot about the country, about its fights and victories despite some critics that the lead roles are played by American actors.
The story tells of sports, racial conditions and Nelson Mandela.
The relentless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is presented in his life story by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that the 91-year-old Mandela asked him if he could portray him in Eastwood's film.
It stars Matt Damon.
I told him, 'If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
The 72-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in Eastwood's Boxing Drama, the Million Dollar Baby boxing award, has already portrayed, for example, the leader of the slavery-relieft movement, which eventually became a slave, a fictional US president and even a god in Božský Evan, but rarely someone who is still alive and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active work for ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and then became president of the country for four years.
He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.
Invictus is the Latin word for the unbeaten and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him
The film is a true story about how Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francoo Pienaar, to help unite the country. President-elect Mandela knows that his nation remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes he can bring his people together through sport, so he decides to unite rugby players who are outsiders on a global scale.
The South African team will eventually advance to the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get the story of Mandela on the screen.
I had no other goal but to play this role in bringing it as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dine with him, be backstage before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found out that when I squeezed your hand, I'd take over your energy, it's transmitted, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to be a different person.
Matt Damon is portrayed in François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, which was dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard-core world of rugby.
The big surprise for him in the end was when he first met Pienaar at his home.
I remember ringing the doorbell, he opened the door for me, and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the film'.
Despite the distinct differences in the actors' characters compared to their real designs under Eastwood, Invictus won: Undecrafeated positive reviews, and there is also talk of Academy Awards.
The film's critic for the Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his review in the words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In the film reviews on rottentomatoes.com's website, Invictus received 76 percent of the positive reviews.
The secret of the glow over Norway deciphered: the Russians test the racket
Above Norway, it was possible to observe a special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defense Ministry only admitted yesterday that it was testing an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
But the launch was again unsuccessful, and the missile referred to as the "Bulava" that was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian military is slowly becoming the black moth of both Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence in the missile's tests did not have the proper effect of the test flight success.
The Bulava didn't usually take off at all or was damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, "Bulava" is already referred to as a "rocket that doesn't fly."
The rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This in the sequence already the 13th attempt was at first a normal one.
It was not until the end of the flight that the apparatus was again in technical damage to the apparatus.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, "The Bell" took off from the atomic submarine Dmitry Donsky, which was sailing under the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the launch to be fired from a vessel that is in the movement and submerged at the same time.
It is therefore likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unspecified flying object was indeed a broken "Bulava."
Indeed, the Norwegians had no doubt from the first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generals are fighting back this time, arguing that there is no clear question of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket lasted and the accident affected the third.
In previous cases, the engines broke down in the first stage.
Although there was not a single trial start completely without a flaw, the Defense Ministry's leadership considers only six of the thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The nearly 50% success rate therefore fills the generals with optimism, and so he still argues that "Bulava" will one day fly without any problems and that it will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov signed a one-year contract at CSKA Moscow at the age of 5
The legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will be back in a professional hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup champion will help out in the emergency of his CSKA Moscow team and will appear to be in the KHL's match against St. Petersburg in Friday's KHL match.
Fetisov, who ended his career at the age of 40 in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljash got injured, we badly need another defender.
Fetisov regularly trains and has agreed to help the team.
We just need to finish some formalities, the AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club Sergei Neminov as saying.
It is not yet clear whether the famous hockey player's comeback will only be about one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can boost the spirit of the other players, said Germanov.
According to AP, Fetisov will become Russia's oldest professional hockey player in the event of a return to the ice.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played for Hartford for the past 17th year, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world titles, and triumphed at the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championships.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he twice lifted the Stanley Cup in Detroit.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai complied with the unions. Cancels all overtime
The management of the Nošovice automaker Hyundai agreed with the unions to abolish all overtime.
It was because of the afored-relocated overtime that the unions declared a strike emergency on Monday.
Hyundai spokesman Petr Vaněk confirmed this.
However, the management wants to agree with the union on one more time this year's shift.
We cannot resign our production plan, that is essential, so voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, with two shifts being made, Vanek said.
The Seven.cz server wrote that the company of employees who work Saturday's shift offered a bonus of CZK 400.
This will be given to people in retrospectively for the working Saturday, November 28.
According to Vanek, the company decided to change the way employees were motivated for the proposed overtime.
They will either have their overtime surcharge reimbursed or they can choose a compensatory leave on December 28th, and thus extend the Christmas holidays a day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees receive a fare and lunch.
Given that overtime was the mosturgent and pressing point in terms of comments and complaints from trade unionists, as well as protesting staff who spontaneously halted production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon to cancel all overtime for the month of December with immediate effect, Vanek said.
Employees of the automaker had been forced to work two more overtime work virtually every day after the eight-hour shift.
After signing the agreement, the unions will call off the strike alert
Further talks between the car management and trade unionists are scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
The head of the union, Petr Kuchař, said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they would be ready to cancel the strike alert.
The situation at the car maker escalated last week on Wednesday, when some 400 employees spontaneously went on strike overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged bullying.
Management countered that overtime employees had to do overtime to meet the requirements for car supplies.
In their strike call for an emergency on Monday, the union also demanded that the staff who discontinued production last Wednesday were not sanctioned by any sanctions.
In the area of overtime, the union is asking the company to reduce the overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay a reward of CZK 5,000 for it this year.
Nošovice automaker Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
The company started production production last November.
By this September, it had produced some 80,000 cars, with its current production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on 'tursed' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow down the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works for the viruses that have already gained immunity against the drugs.
This fact outweighs in some cases that the compound does not work as strongly as some already available medicines to the common variant of the virus.
The AIDS disease cannot yet be cured.
However, patients can be significantly prolonged by a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of HIV from multiplying the virus in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, the incomplete suppression of the virus's propagation results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which the drugs are no longer inactive.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from the University of Technology in Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They demonstrated that a substance called methocarborates acts on the protein responsible for the HIV multiplication.
Metalocarmarcates are boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt compounds.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all the drugs used today, and therefore can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come up with new 'enhanced' compounds prepared on the basis of a knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
The metalocarborates have a unique three-dimensional structure: two polyhedron cages made up of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is a HIV protein protein that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by the fission of HIV, there would not have been a mature infectious virus particle.
When we stop the HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and the Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is further systematically amended.
A little weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of HIV protease agents was tested in the tube and also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborates on the common variant of the enzyme is not as powerful as for clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect for resistant options against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical treatment, make methocarborates interesting compounds for further research towards the design of effective HIV drugs, said Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Institute of Molecular Genetics and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
An argument over the budget. ODS has taken on Fischer, he fights back
The head of the ODS, Mirek Topolánek, called the approved budget for next year "horrifzes" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider another existence.
The ODS statement was described by the Prime Minister as strong statements.
He says he's having time for analysis.
ODS deputy chairman Petr Nečas said that the concept of a clerical cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely in the House on a minority to be in the race for a rising deficit or to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The ODS and social democracy approach to the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed, Nečas pointed out.
The House adopted a 2010 budget on Wednesday, with left-wing amendments worth more than CZK 12 billion.
The House has raised money for the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's criticism of the Social Democrat proposals was that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the chamber before the vote, granting the government's wish that even the amended budget is a less bad option than a budget makeshift.
Disappointment and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and frustration, with Prime Minister Jan Fischer saying that the government will assess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota were to threaten to seriously resign from office if amendments were adopted, the situation might have looked different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment for the prime minister after the government on Monday.
He indicated that he was considering staying in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer speaks for another fight with the budget deficit, Nečas says, the GOP nominees, which pushed through the budget changes, are not at all.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House approves further laws to increase the deficit, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or an amendment to the Public Servants Act.
Topolánek: ODS nominees not guilty
It is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire Government.
The ODS nominees did nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in a US text message.
He recalled that in several ministries there were people in the deputy's positions who voted against the budget.
Nečas emphasized that if Fischer decides to resign to the principle of combating the public deficit in the government deficit, "it is perfectly logical and fair to lean on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
But then, he said, he could not count on the support and tolerance of the Civic Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and when it is up to date, Defence Minister Martin Barták told reporters in the House of Commons, who was nominated to the government by the Civic Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels for the European Council meeting in the afternoon.
At the request of the Prime Minister, ODS backed down
Nečas also stressed that the ODS would probably vote in the House on Wednesday against the amended budget if the prime minister did not explicitly ask the members of the Civic Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, he then responded to the question of whether the ODS was the absence of the party's president in parliament and the Czech Republic in the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't notice my voice missing.
Even as I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the months to come it would be primarily about the Bolshevisation of the House and the destruction of all the positive, Topolánek himself responded.
Under the new ČD order, fewer trains will run for almost the same fare
Czech Railways will cancel or restrict some of the less busy fast trains and locals from 13 December, while other connections will be strengthened.
The overall transport scale will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most fares, including basic and customer fares, will not change.
For example, the residents of Ostrava will get more possibilities of connection to the capital, the railways will add one pendolino set to this line.
The speeding train, on the other hand, will stop going to Bratislava.
Fewer fast trains will also depart on the line Praha - Písek - České Budějovice, and the direct connections Prague - Letohrad will be fundamentally reduced.
Of the regions, the railways plan the largest reduction in transport in the Hradec Králové Region, by a total of eight percent, the increase can be enjoyed by Prague and its surroundings.
Two night trains on the route Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice and the operation of several fast trains on the line Praha - Písek - České Budějovice are also cancelled only to some days of the week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today Milovické must transfer in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at the destination station Prague Main Station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run in two-hour intervals.
Pendolin to Bratislava will no longer be taken by passengers since 13 December.
This year's regional railway bill: 200 million more
The speedsters are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, giving a total of CZK 4 billion to reimburse the so-called provable losses to the railways next year, as it did this year. The locomotives are being ordered by the regions, with a total of eight billion crowns for them next year, with the state contributing less than three billion to the counties.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The runways have a newly concluded 10-year contract for locals and fast trains, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The tracks praise the system, which is why they did not seem to have reached an increase in the price of the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will only be made for one-day ČD Net network tickets and cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from CZK 450 to CZK 600.
The price of eLiška will be newly based on the distance travelled, so far it has been uniform for the journey between any regional cities and amounted to 160 crowns.
Filipino militants still detain over 50 people, Children set to go free
Armed militants kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines today, including several primary school pupils and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which initially reported only 65 abductees.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The abduction took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 gunmen are said to be using the hostage as a living shield as fleeing police.
Local negotiators are now trying to arrange the extradition of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, police initially chased the kidnappers for the violence that required the settling of scores between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao, martial law was declared due to the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
The victims of the November 23Ning massacre related to the election for the Governor's Office were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential genus Ampatuan, was arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film Invictus (official Czech, Invictus: Undefeated) is released in American cinemas, capturing part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter was played by Morgan Freeman, whom he said he chose Mandela for his portrayal years ago.
The men's side role as the legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar was played by Matt Damon.
With the release of the film in cinemas, they are coming from the acclaim of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
The full name Nelson Rolihla Mandela was born on the 18th. July 1918 in the Mvez, South Africa.
He received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 1988, and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 with de Klerk.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
high expectations, as they come to the public at a time when South Africa's preparations for the World Cup are both at the height of their preparations for the World Cup, the media is being shaken by the worrying news of rising racial hatred and discrimination against the population by the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the response to the new film in South Africa has been mostly positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the casting of the lead roles by the "professional" Hollywood stars.
Nevertheless, Morgan Freeman is, in his words, proud of the new film.
I've been dreaming about the role for years and preparing for it.
I have also met Nelson Mandela in person many times to - as they say - draw his energy, he said in an interview after the film's premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we can remind the film of Mandela's personality and message.
It's the story of South Africa, but it concerns everyone, he added.
In the jersey of the national team rugby
The film, based on a book by British writer John Carlin, with the loosely translated title In the role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave rise to the nation, portrays a South African human rights advocate of a South African presidential term.
Morgan Freeman, therefore, has been trying to cement two racial and for years of mutually defined population groups and, as in 1995, Nelson Mandela, he also enters the playing field of South Africa's national rugby jersey to the World Cup, which JAR won at the time.
For entering the turf in a jersey that is seen in South Africa almost sacred, Mandela received a big ovation from a predominantly white audience fourteen years ago and earned the recognition of the white population.
The Football Championship may be able to bring people back into a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will only become clear.
But White South Africans are skeptical, as rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled to Britain from the country, revealed in a recent interview with the LN.
The championship will begin 11. June 2010.
A transformer for tens of millions of crowns burns in Lounsk
The fire engulfed the transformer of the company Čeps in the morning in the substation at the village of Výškov na Lounsku.
The fire is hit by six units, according to the spokesman for the Ústí Regional Fire Department, Lukáš Marvana.
Originally, firefighters wanted to have the transformer burned out, but later reconsider the view and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and special extingucing substances.
The cause was a technical fault, an internal short-circuit transformer.
No one was injured, the crash, according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandátová, does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, it will only be quantified after the fire is over.
The destroyed transformer will need to be replaced by a new one, according to Mandate.
Nothing like this has happened in the ten years of the company's ten years of operation, defects of this type are unique, she added.
Electricity supplies were not interrupted, according to ČEZ spokesperson for North Bohemia, Soni Holinger Hendrychová, the functioning of households, authorities and companies were not affected by the fire at the transformer station.
A.s. The sits operate in the Czech Republic as the exclusive transmission system operator, the power lines 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, restores and develops 39 substations with 67 transformers converters converting electricity from the transmission system to the grid and the 4339-kilometre line route.
Jančura files criminal complaint for defamation against three ČSSD governors
Student Agency owner Radim Jančura will file a criminal complaint today for defamation against three social-democratic governors.
This was on Michal Hašek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínek from the Pardubice Region and the Governor of the Olomouc Region, Martin Tesařík.
Jančura made the announcement in Twenty Minutes to Radiožurnál.
The lawsuit is linked to the firm's efforts to operate regional train services in some regions.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three generals are attacking us and talking about choosing raisins, yet we have only made an offer for what they wanted.
He says we are more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true because we know the prices of Czech Railways that were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It is for defamation against Student Agency, he told Radiožurnálu Jančura.
At the same time, he said he had evidence from all regions that they had not taken steps in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing the initiative for the European Commission.
Hasek sees the filing of the criminal complaint as a further continuation of Mr. Jančura's media show, which serves as an unpaid advertisement for his companies and his own.
I am, of course, prepared to defend the good name of my region and mine, and to the same thing I will call out to other generals.
I expect that even on this occasion it will become clear that it is Mr Jančura who is manipulating the public about regional rail transport and using false and false arguments, Hasek said.
Jančura announced last week that he would invest several million crowns in advertising to be highlighted by the regions.
He told Radiožurnálu that he would suspend the campaign after Christmas and continue it after the New Year.
He specified that the campaign would be waged against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jančura after the regions agreed to operate regional railway connections with Czech Railways and did not tender for a contract of around CZK 150 billion.
According to Jančura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of the train transport in the regions, he says, Jančura was already threatened by the ČSSD MP.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose the bus licensing.
He introduced himself as a ČSSD MP, I know which gentleman he is, I will not say his name, he told Radiožurnálu Jančura today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococci will bring down the established customs from January.
It is to be the first for families to be free and optional at the same time.
But there are already voices that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are at its peak.
The drugstitute already sets the maximum prices for vaccines paid for by health insurance companies.
Experts are also already clear on the vaccination course.
New vaccination
Free vaccines for August children
From January, children born on August 2 last year and later can be vaccinated against pneumococci free of charge on August 2 last year.
The condition is that they have not yet received a single dose of vaccination.
Whoever started vaccinating last year or early has to pay for another booing.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between the age of the child and the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococci.
The parents paid CZK 1,600 for one or more benefit.
Inviting the youngest children, four doses are needed.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend between CZK 300,000 and CZK 450,000 per year on vaccination benefits.
But it will save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has given roughly 500,000 a year for all the child-wide vaccinations.
The parse vaccination was introduced by the so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also severe infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
We die from pneumococcal infections in our country in a year in a year, according to hospital surveys.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they introduced reimbursed blanket vaccinations for children against pneumococcal in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are suggestions that this vaccination could be made compulsory in the future.
It is to be paid for by insurance companies and optional from January.
The mandatory vaccination was better, for example, suggested the head of the civic association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovský.
His association has long promoted the pneumococcal vaccines.
Experts at the international conference that our association participated in were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we had voluntary vaccinations.
It's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that at least this has been passed.
I think that's the way we have to take now, Kalovský said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination process against pneumococcal.
We are not considering it at the moment at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say
Hana Cabrnoch, chairman of the Professional Society of Practitioners of Children's Physicians, acknowledges that she has her disadvantages to volunteer vaccination.
If all children were vaccinated, consideration could be given to reducing the number of booing "In a situation where this vaccine costs such a large amount, we quite understand the political decision that the vaccination was triggered as voluntary," says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococci from next year by more than 80 percent of recent parents.
Vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in that it is the first to be paid for by health insurance companies, not by the state, as the first across-the-board vaccination.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, saving on further treatments, Cabrnoch explains.
Doctors will have to buy the fabrics themselves
But this is linked to the concerns of general practitioners of pediatrics, which relate to the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original intention, the vaccines were to be purchased by insurance companies, and doctors would receive them in the same way that the state supplies them with substances for other vaccinations.
But some MPs feared that insurance companies might "drag money out of health insurance."
Doctors will therefore have to buy the substances and wait for the insurance companies to reimburse them.
According to estimates, individual practitioners will invest 40,000 a month in vaccines, a significant sum.
It won't be easy at all, says Cabrnoch.
Son of American artist 'crawled at the museum'
The son of renowned American fantthal creator Frank Frazetta has been charged with attempting to rob the $20 million (£12 million) of his father's museum of paintings.
Police in Pennsylvania said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
The appointee, the appointee and the second man, were used a backhoe to break into the museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr Frazetta Sr., aged 81, became famous for creating the characters of Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time of this, the artist was in Florida, as reported by the Associated Press.
AP quoted an unnamed police official as saying that Mr. Frazetta Jr. could have been motivated to act by prolonged family disputes.
In front of the police, Mr Frazetta, the younger sworn statement, the age of 52, that he had done so at his father's behest "to get to the museum in any possible way and move the paintings to the hedgeholes," as the agency said.
Mr Frazetta Sr denied granting any such authorisation, as the Agency said.
Labour resists planned tax increases
Minithers advocated an increase in taxes and spending cuts, announced in a preliminary budget report against criticism from the opposition, business and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling put it, the Tories have "smocked" the possibility of showing that they were serious about postponing the decision to reduce the deficit until after the election.
The chancellor, too, came under fire because of the disability of low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, this is mainly an increase of 0.5% in social insurance and a 1% adjustment of public payments from 2011 onwards.
Distram over social insurance
The unions protested that low-income workers had been punished for a recession that they had not caused and warned in advance of "problems."
Social insurance is increasing - an increase of around £3 trillion a year - outraged by the community of entrepreneurs who said it was an employment tax while focusing on the recovery of the economy.
This increase, limited to these incomes of more than £2000 a year, will affect around 10 million workers.
KEY POINT-TERM OF PBR
Social insurance to increase by an additional 0.5% from April 2011
The economic situation will deteriorate more than expected, by 4.75% this year
New taxation of 50% of bankers' bonuses
Increase in firms' 1% tax on depreciation for small firms
Tax reduction for electric cars and wind farms
Increasing the assessment of pensions by 2.5
According to an estimate by the state administration, some of the £30,000 revenue of £30,000 a year will be reduced and some £40000 income will be reduced by £1900, while some £100,000 in revenue will increase by £110.
Ministers announced that their target of halving the deficit by 2013 meant "complex decision-making" but insisted that 60% of the special taxes should account for 5% of the highest-income earners.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms denied that the proposed increase in taxes and spending curbs would be a "drip in the ocean" compared to what would have to be done.
"These are big numbers. This will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is absolutely the basic requirement for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said that he believed that the economy should grow at the turn of the year.
But making a forecast for future economic growth - which will have an impact on the volume of loans needed and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the chancellor was forced to revise the earlier sums.
In the opinion, he said, the economic downturn this year was 4.75% - far worse than the 3.5% decline, forecast in April - because the loans were £3 trillion higher than previously estimated.
A wasted opportunity'
The Conservatives, who launched a new promotional campaign on Thursday, warning of a "crisis of indebtedness" by the Labour, called the planned £878 trillion loan intolerable over the next six years.
Ministers failed to submit a credible plan, as could be reimbursed, "cynically" postponed this decision until after the election - which must take place by June 2010.
"They have not harmed anything significant that would be feasible," said Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond. "They had a chance to do it, but they wasted it."
"All the important announcements will be made after the election if we win them "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, as opposed to the Tory proposals, who would like to reduce the deficit more quickly and to a larger extent.
But the Liberal Democrats argue that the money raised by raising taxes and spending cuts should be used to support spending next year and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans are "built on the sand."
The BBC's political commentator Nick Robinson said of the timing of the message - for example, the aforementioned inflation will rise and there will be an inability to receive benefits next April - that this could lead to an accusation by the chancellor of the election campaign if the money would be difficult to recover a year later.
But the Labour insists insist on providing special assistance if the people in need of it very much and the situation is revised in September 2010.
Suspicious budget'
Although ministers did not disclose details of the post-sided spending, economists said it was clear that a reduction in public spending would only be the start of medium-term curtailments.
The respected Institute of Budget Studies reported that the chancellor's figures indicated by substantial cuts in many areas, potentially in the budocna involving transport, higher education and defence.
"It's really painful so far," said its director, Robert Chote.
"All the important statements will come after the election if we win them," Roger Bootle, an economic adviser to the Deloitte's account revirore, added.
"That was the report of the suspected preliminary budget. The markets are making it."
FBI conducts investigation at 'American prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting an investigation at a prison in Pakistan for five Americans suspected of being linked to extremists.
The men were imprisoned for the attack on a house in Sargoda in eastern Punjab province, as reported by the BBC in the American Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI said it was an investigation into the same men who were pronounced as missing in their last month at their home in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said it was also about getting information about these men.
Three of them are reported to be originally from Pakistan, one of whom has Egyptian ancestry and the others are from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and under what circumstances they were staying there," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency had been briefed on the incarceration and had been in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are cooperating with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are really missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washgington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
It said the house had always been the focus of local police and that charges had not yet been filed against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillry Clinton declined to comment on the arrest, Reuters news agency reported, but said the United States must "collaborate much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in uncovering the infrastructure of terrorism that is being christened in the recruitment and training of the people."
The disappearance of these five students from their home in N.N. Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Rejecting the amnesty for the Iranian abused.
The situation in respect for human rights in Iran is as bad as in the last 20 years, as reported in the Amnesty International team's report.
The report details the "mandours of torture" in the pre- and post-various presidential election in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Others said he was at risk of being raped.
Iran has denied the above criticism of this report on respect for human rights.
Officials described the criticism as politically motivated.
Thousands of people were imprisoned in Iran and dozens were killed after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the biggest street dismantling since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Dozens of them were remanded in custody, and prosecutors sentenced the last five people to the death penalty.
The BBC's correspondent in Tehran, John Leyne, who is now in London, said that earlier in the protests of Supreme Leader Ayatolah Ali Khomeini, he declared the unlawfulness of certain methods of torture and banned their implementation at the Karizak Correctional Facility.
But since then, almost no criticism of the legal power has been tolerated, as our correspondent said.
False confession'
Amnesty International cited a report by a 26-year-old computer science student, Ibrahim Methari, who said he had been charged with "working with the Facebook network" and protesting the election results.
"I was often beaten in the face," he said in the statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, my head... They threatened me with execution and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still bleeding and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was detained after the election after the protests and was tortured to death in prison and the others were raped.
Iran's senior civil servants have denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that torture took place.
Amnesty also reported the case of a former prisoner who said he was being held in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a prison in Kahrizak.
The Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the post-election riots and the government's response, but said that the mandates and the powers of the institutions were unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees were published.
The group said that at least 90 people have been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn the monument in Bristol into a downhill track for the plant.
The downhill track for the park race attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowborders to compete for the financial prizes.
At the top of the downhill track in Brandon Hill, the short ski jump was a 100-meter long downhill skiing track.
Fourth-grade medical student John Hickman said it was a wonderful view from the top of the downhill track, but that it was really distressing.
It was a wonderful view of the blinking lights of the city below.
There were some of the best skiers and snowborders from all over the country - some of them real talents," he added.
The awards were awarded for the best pieces - or manoeuvres on the downhill track.
After Thursday night's race, the snow was left to melt.
Still them and us
Can a Muslim be a Frenchman?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters were calling for a ban on the construction of minarets and alarmist news is widely circulating about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, the American academic wrote and informed, wondering whether Muslims could integrate - and whether they were integrating - into one of the continent's most open secular societies.
Some of the readers, after reading this book, became an admirer of the author's last work, "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves" (2006), this elegant and discussed study on contentious issues that have been splitting and employing the country for 15 years, and the effects of which are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book has a broader and much more ambitious take.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media said about Islam in France, but what really happened at the ground.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes now caring for 5 ÷ 6 million of the French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces."
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students about the issues that are most of alarming.
Should a Muslim enter into a marriage marriage at a mosque or City Hall (or both places)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about the evolution and rights of gays?
Can a Muslim woman marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does a Muslim have the right to use a promotional banking system if he wants to get a mortgage?
These seemingly worldly contentious issues are being discussed, and which are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among others of well-known people, including Tariko Ramadan, the Arab, the Muslim researcher and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is attempting to open up a debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society at the same time.
They have no arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are distrustful of the true ideo of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists interviewed are inclined to the housewives that this is a counterpart to Selafi—the favorants of the teenage Sunni Islam, grouped in Saudi Arabia— this group is small, but influencing European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adapting requires compromises on both sides.
He wonders how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite who so doggedly advocate the lay public) are, in fact, indulgences to the idea of pluralism.
He is of the opinion that Muslims are probably less experienced in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than developing pragmatism, he found "the cull of the screenshots."
Can a Muslim be a Frenchman? After reading this book, one may have a tendency to say, "Yes, but not now."
The most deserving outlook in the world
The Arctic is changing more dramatically than the rest of the planet's environment.
The bounding ice melts at an alarming rate, which affects the animals and their survival as anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural water resources, along with diplomats, lawyers and writers in their wake.
In "On the Thin Ice," Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, depicts the natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Well acquainted with the complicated history and whaling practices describes the long tradition of polar explorers who attempted to seize the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's meeting with a daring 14-year-old lifeguard who fought only with the collapse of the musket is indeed a myth, but everything else is true.
The young bears who swam behind the bodies of their just-killed mothers were captured and sent to the zoo and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears were suddenly performing in one circus tent.
Even today, the zoo enclosures typically have an area a million times smaller than the area available to adults in the wild. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore turned green from algae growing growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws on the works of other writers and historians, often returning to the threat of hunters threatening the survival of the species.
Although hunting is banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where they are hunted from helicopters and Indians on skis, and are all armed with powerful attacking rifles to blast their prey.
The irony is that it takes place in the water to the north of these two hunting nations, and that the ice will eventually be the greatest.
In his new book, "After Ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers science's clear and dismal responsibility for the Arctic, and an intriguing glimpse of how the future can change it.
Not everything scientists have the answers.
Even meteorologists and oceanographers do not have an adequate response to the speed of the changes.
It's for lack of testing.
Fridtjof Nansen's research trips at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries first indicated the movement of floating ice.
Submarines during the Cold War then mapped the shifting watershed as they were floating.
Satellite scans and extensive probes in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but many are still being held thanks to the intrepid individuals camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson peers into the extraordinarily fragile world of the catchment system in the interior of the Arctic ice, created by the trickling of salt water, which shrinks during the freezing.
But from the outstrip of the bear to the microscopic miracles to be stuck, all doomed once the summer ice moves, which takes place sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... that's how we'll be
6,000 Marine riders laid wreaths on graves in Arlington
Petty Officer De'Angello Robinson, 19, had travelled on a seven-hour bus to lay a simple wreath on the soldier's grave, had never met the deceased.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from the Johnson camp in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the Arlington National Cemetery to garnish the graves, that was the day in which they would pay tribute to men and women who once wore the same shoes.
In a few months of boarding, it could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me to show me respect as I am trying to do so.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered on that Saturday morning to lay wreaths in the veteran cemetery in several departments of commemorative ceremony in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Funeral Society in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the commemorative ceremony in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition that Mr. nMorill and his wife, Karen, make this trip every year and stop in different cities along the way to honour the memory of military personnel and victims of terrorism.
The Worcestesters are not looking for profit, wreaths across America, which they also lay in other states.
That year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths at Arlington Cemetery, Pentagon, graves at the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City, and the commemorative site of United United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year running, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $1,50000 to buy and transport wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, the deceased member of the armed forces.
As her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs Hunt said it was her trip to return what the victim was.
It's a small way for citizens to support our troops, she said.
It's like a visit to the family grave.
Covered in the coats of warm cloth, the volunteers walked through the cemetery along the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed for the older graves of World War I and the World War and the Vietnam War, because these are not visited as often as newer graves
The mood was positive when the children played and held their hands together as they carried the young pine tree to the grey tombstones.
Each circular wreath was deep green with a small red arc of the upper part.
Near§ in Unit 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, there has been a real silence.
The affiliated services organizations donated to 1,000 wreaths to decorate the department, but the gloomy mood of the ongoing wars filled the area.
Some wept sincerely, some prayed, and families and friends held each other in the cold air.
Some read the names, engraved in the stones, while others bent down to inspect the small black-and-white name tags, pushed into the wet mud where the tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from her eyes outside her son's grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the final resting place of hijacking Sergeant with the underwater artillery sergeant David Shane Spicer, who died in the battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. . .my son paid the price, she said.
"Even though I've been away for a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
U.S. government contractor imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has imprisoned a U.S. government contractor who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, as reported by State Department officials on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, worked for the Bethesda-based Alternatives Development Alternatives Inc.
The company is working on projects for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the American Intercitas of the Riding Association, sought access to the detainee who was imprisoned on December 5.
Some accusations have not been made public, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreigner may be imprisoned for almost anything that is described as "dangerous."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, such as mild protests and critical essays, are at risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered to be serious offences.
In Cuba, there is a young blogging community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Ms Sánchez repeatedly applied for permission to leave the country in order to receive the prizes, but was denied the permit.
The detention of an American supplier may be the result of rising tensions between the communist Castro's brother, ruling Cuba, and the Obama administration, which was watched as a "reserving tactic" in improving relations with the island.
They were first reported on the imprisonment of the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy has stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and creates more space for the opposition, the combined states will take reciprocal action.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, though they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average wage for a public servant is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones this year; these are mostly used to send textgures, because a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one day's wages.
Internet use on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans, who often want to sign up, must announce their names to the government.
Access to many websites is forbidden.
Detention of an American in Cuba is a rarity.
Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in the Cuba prison are behind bars for stressed-related acts like drug smuggling, Gloria Berben, the U.S. Across-Oprising Section, press clerk for the U.S. Interest in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she could not provide more information about the prison.
The imprisonment and detention were clearly amoral.
Such activities that would be legal in any other open society - with, say, free mobile phones - are a criminal offence in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the US human rights group program that recently published an unfavorous report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, the same Cuba," as a reference for the installation of Raulo Castro as the country's leader and a replacement for the auspensive older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants were often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said that all solutions would be more political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are moving towards a more extensive dialogue.
Pakistan's civil service staff is uncovering a conspiracy to broadcast men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered the alleged leader of a conspiracy on the deployment of five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill members of U.S. troops there, and said they hoped the case might help expose a large network of recruits of terrorists who prowl online and seek out radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were searching for a grey rebel figure, known as Saiflah, who invited these men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one of these men posted a commenting approving the terrorist attacks ma's online video player.
Saifillah took the lead on these men as soon as they came to Pakistan, he tried to help them get into the distant region of Pakistan in the territory of the indigenous tribes of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who reported the case said on Saturday that Saifull had been unsuccessful in convicting al-Qaida commanders and that the men were not part of the CIA's attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were dropped for several days into the eastern district of Sarghoda, far from the menacing mountains in the northwest that had become a refuge for the terrorists.
They were considered a strike force.
The question of why they were dropped was said by the official, who spoke of maintaining anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to get approval to gain access to al-Qaida camps when they were arrested for exercising the Pakistani law.
The case of this five - which remained in Pakistan and was questioned by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruits in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, determining who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001, US intelligence service has assigned the top priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaida.
The organization's recruiters act as guards, eliminating those who are not serious enough in their commitment to holy war and those who could be spies.
American fake recruits have been subjected to special scrutiny in al-Qaida, analysts said.
But they were also considered extraordinarily interesting in the group because, given their potential approach to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, an senior analyst at the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years, allowing the coh to accede to them because U.S. intelligence agencies have recruited experts in their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to break into these groups, is there no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has been so tracked? said Mr Kohlmann.
This model is one of those that is much more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanded climate 'action'
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets this Saturday, demanding stronger climate action from negotiators at the city's Bella Convention Center.
Protesters reported the number of many hundreds of thousands of participants in the event, but police are striving that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively quiet, and a handful of masked activists laid several small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
The day a minor incident occurred in climate talks sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists passed through the city, carrying banners with the English words "This is not Planet B" (i.e., second-rate) and one in Spanish, who proclaimed "Earth says 'Else'."
The protest was attended by several celebrities, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said she had travelled to her mother's birthplace in Peru and provided me with information about the bleak state of the country, in which the influence of climate change, which is still taking place.
This is a partial reason why we have decided to join this great march -- to walk through the world and appeal to the world's leaders to present a fair, ambitious, and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it cannot be avoided all the time.
Police prevented the protesters from approaching the Bella Center and said they had detained 19 people, in the first place because they had either wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during the demonstrations.
According to one of the detached viewers, who does not wish to be identified because he is involved in climate hornners, activists masked as athletes and black suits have laid several charges in the comeogled against Copenhagen's main channel, located near several ministries.
They agitated at the buildings, he said, opening with flares, but followed by "several major explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the TV screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not penetrate the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Weie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if the demonstration nevertheless had a constructive impact on the international negotiations, he replied in English to "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (actually, it is something I do not realise).
Then he went on to Chinese and said "Because the site is extensive, I can't hear what's going on out there."
He watched as to whether the march was painful or helpful depending on everyone's prospects.
You can see the focus of the general public and the various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: "It can also be said that this is a violation of the conduct or the freedom of other persons.
Test data revealed constant persistent racial differences
The federal certificate from last week on the knowledge of mathematics achieved was a welcome element of the good news about Columbia's public education.
Though the precinct lags far behind the country's high-performance systems, the certificate has shown greater advances among fourth and eighth-grade students in the last two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers of the National Attestation Centre for Progress in Teaching are the persistent differences in the knowledge made between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average result for the fourth-grade Columbia district of white pupils over the past two years increased from 267 to 270 points (from a possible 500), but for their African-American peers there was only three points to grow, from 209 to 212.
Indeed, the difference in knowledge gained increased from 53 to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
Progress with the eighth-grade African-American remains essentially aligned, with a deflection of a statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The average result for white pupils was not included in the test results as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over the horizon of six years is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between the white and black pupils of the fourth grades in 2003, when the first NAEP in the precinct was carried out, was 60 points in the scale (262 to 202).
Although the result achieved in children from the twoia groups improved during this period, the difference was barely close to 58.
Some of the precinct's education attorneys in the last week have said the results, hailed by secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) has been more widely stimulated in white students where there were already high results.
That would suggest that we have increased the total support for those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, D.C. CEO. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates the equality of doing so in the district.
I'm not jumping up and down for a two- or three-point variation, said committee member D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Primary School.
Often criticising Mrs Rhee's administration style, Ms Brown said that reporting on the test results was a state of secondary education in the city and requires attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the pros, and I respect that.
But what is terrifying is that we have devoted almost no time and energy to devote to our secondary education.
Mrs Rhee said the district's aim was to continue to find better ways, focused on the needs of low-catchers.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in using the new curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at upper-class students in primary schools and high school students who have failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their round-ending careers, lagging significantly behind their peers.
The day-to-day math and curriculum curriculum of mathematics in the sixth grade, highlighting the games and experiences of real life that made it to the precinct under former director Clifford Janeyi, can be attributed to the progress of the NAEP, which was reported last week.
And I think we should continue to work and make the best possible interventions for those students who remain below the level of the class, said Mrs Rhee.
The others said that the NAEP results clarified the question of whether Mrs Rhee could continue to roll down the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and funds for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It is a certain outspoken dilemma of Mrs. Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teaching professor at the University of California, Berkeley where he studies the test results in urban areas.
The conventional correction procedure is to focus the means and administrative reforms on schools, located in the worst parts of the Columbia district.
Thus, the focus can bring political repercussions that are directed against an important agenda.
But the rebuke also belongs to other city directors who are trying to maintain the central approach between the whites and the black.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We must tighten the affinity of our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can be relied upon to be given excellent public training to their children.
Mr Janey, now the headmaster of the Newark schools, said in an interview this week that the basic element of reducing the difference in the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, in order to take place the legitimacy of the schools.
You must get up to 200 days to push through the changes, said Mr. Janey, who signed a contract with his teachers' association last year for a school year of 185 days, which he considers a "sign" for finding a bigger increase next year.
To make higher education part of a better future
The oncoming bus entered Gettysburg College with a loud rest.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stepped out and rested for a moment on white pillars, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Graciela's parents barely graduated from college in El Salvador.
So far, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the grounds of the college.
Now she and other eighth grade pupils in the group surveyed Gettysburg, where tuition fees were $8,669 per year, their position being rather than fearful visitors enthusiastic potential students.
Yes! That's it! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the knowledge building.
She said thoughtfully when they were told by the low-level professors' relationship with the students.
The Pennsylvania College was one of seven who were visited on their three-day trip and were now completely intrigued by the future news: The question is not whether you will enter the college.
The question is from where.
However, this is a bearing issue regarding the high number of children born in the US of Spanish immigrant children who are excluded from colleges or become pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive a college education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, a fifth of this "dupe generation" of the Spanish college pupils - the remarkable results achieved indicate that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central American residents, made it to the United States without finishing college.
Their success story is important, researchers say, as this underlines their point of the way forward for the generation that played a marginal role in the country's workforce.
Those who have reached a university degree say they had a natural leaning towards the school and innate assertiveness and an effort to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and looked for ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Gracieel and the millions of children who would like to take the dorm - especially if these efforts persist over in time.
Considering that I come from low-income groups whose parents have no experience and the ability to help them orstand to help them get to the system, any simple intervention at each of the individual points will not solve this, says Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American region.
We must think about giving these children a preschool network in all ways to get started by college.
The federal program that funded Graciela's trip on the tracks is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (investigate), it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launching dorming preparatory programmes that start for students from small-income groups in high school and continue until these students end up college.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, more than% of whom entered the dormitories, according to data from the US Department of Education.
Iraqi oil Ministry reached agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to get major oil companies to redevelop their sickly infrastructure during the two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements were concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum Industry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in rebuilding the Iraqi oil industry, crippled by decades of warfare and sanctions.
American companies left with a shareholding of just two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven US companies paid for their participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one made the lost offer.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements on the fields that were auctioned in June.
The shredding participation of the US oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened the door after six years of war, and instead of American companies, you have Asian and Europeans on the way in the first place, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
That will be long before anything else is for sale in Iraq.
Concerns about security, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the U.S. military, are likely to discourage American companies from doing much more intensive business in Iraq, which has demonstrably the third-largest raw material reserves, say analysts.
American firms have been at a disadvantage in some cases, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy firms have noticeably lower operating costs and are more prone to taking risks because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to conclude agreements with the ministry.
Leading American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintained close contacts with the Iraqi Oil Industry Ministry and offered technical assistance in recent years, left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts awarded at the end of this week.
China's state-run National Petroleum Corp. participated in offers for more contracts than all other companies and left with large stakes in contracts for the two main fields.
We all know that China is striving to become a major economic, as well as a technology force, said oil ministry spokesman Assam Jihad.
We believe that Chinese society will be comparable to the competition and honour its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that were preliminarily selected for bids, which were then compared by the Ministry at the price per barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay to strengthen the output above the current levels in each field.
The top planner for al-Qaida was apparently killed in Pakistan.
The impact of the U.S. missile's missile at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week appears to have been killed by the top-of-the-range planner of al-Qaida's operations, as reported Friday by U.S. counterterrorism officials.
As confirmed, this could be the second fatal attack on one of the terrorist's top leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who were killed when several rockets hit their car near the city of Miran Śáh in Sevverní Vaziristan province, according to U.S. sources and pact officials in the area.
Local authorities dug to the fact that the missiles were fired from the unmanned aircraft, with which the CIA operates in a zone of illegal indigenous tribes.
These were directed at a white car that was heading towards the Afghan border when it was hit, the official and the Pakistani Cicilian Intelligence Agency said, which was on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said that the local militants rushed to the point and quickly confiscate what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two US counter-terrorism officials cited an unspecified witness who said that Somali was dead.
Somali was cited as a high-ranking planner for al-Qaida military operations, who directed terrorist groups operations outside the Afghanistan and Pakset regions.
He was involved in the progenitis worldwide, said a senior official who did not wish to be named, who stated the sensitive nature of U.S. airstrikes in the territory of Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, he was probably involved in the attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from the top management of Al-Qaida and planned possible terrorist attacks on the basis of them.
Another US official said that Somali had advanced rapidly in the al-Qaida hierarchy and was well linked to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not have been a well-known person for some Americans, but that he did not humiliate himself in any way to pose before us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somali should be the second high-ranking al-Qaida or Taliban leader who should have been killed from September, when Najmudin Jalolov, the leader of the militant faction in the indigenous tribal band, and three other top pomeative leaders were killed in a similar attack.
The pace of attacks launched by the CIA with drones has been reduced since the summer from an average of approximately six operations per month to two, according to Long War's records, a website run by a nonprofit group.
The reduction may have a reason in the improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability by also ruthlessly killing those suspected of being informants, the page said.
The top delegate of the United Nations in Kabul resigned.
The top delegate of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would like to resign from his post in March, ending a stagnant term that was marred by accusations of widespread corruption in the election of the president in Afghanistan, backed by the UN.
Eide's departure is happening because the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 1,300 US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN delegate said it supported the increase, but expressed concern that the US timetable for the reduction, which would begin in 18 months, a challenge for other NATO governments to withdraw its forces.
We need to accelerate the construction of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they should have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment made must be a long-term one.
The Norwegian diplomat also pushed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian employees to help with the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the part of the civilians, he said.
Eide said he would not resign, but that he was simply delivering on the promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has now said he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it's high time to look for the heir, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month-old vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban began seeking a replacement.
Officials said the decision was made between Staffan di Mistura, who is of Swedish-Italian origin and formerly led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, a Frenchman who had previously conducted UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who was indicted in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the country's presidential election elections for masking the presence of massive election machinations.
Eide denied these allegations, but said that the accusations against Galgraith -- who had been released -- "certainly damaged the mission because there was a high degree of scepticism with regard to international intervention" in the election.
Eide said he proposed a meeting with the top representative of the citizens to coordinate the relief of efforts at the US Force leadership in Afghanistan.
He also urged the leadership of the UN to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries to lend them for the Afghan mission, so, he says, he would like to strengthen their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limitations of its efforts in Afghanistan, saying that the ponderous UN recruitment regulations undermine its ability to exploit capabilities.
The UN rules are such that I have only had the opportunity to get one person since May, he said.
This is a disaster and I cannot go on.
Gates: Iran faces more sanctions
Defence Minister Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose "more significant sanctions" on Iran because of a lack of engagement in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week's trip to the areas where the war is being fought in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to the soldier's inquiry into the likely development. "
One of the things that depends on me is whether I've learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, [that] is the inherent unpredictability in the war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could hit Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has signaled that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said that a "package of incentives and inhibitions" would require "to get the Iranian government to actually feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its people will suffer extraordinarily" sanctions.
In response to a statement issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has involved European leaders in a warning that Iran will bear serious consequences unless it puts its nuclear program in full compliance with the United Nations Nuclear Safety Committee and its Supervisory Authority, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In the talks in Geneva 1. He indicated in October that he wanted to return to talks on the curtailment of his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial portion of his enriched uranium-enriched stockpiles in exchange for the urgently needed fuel for the reactor to conduct medical research.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement as a way of creating trust between the two sides and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to be stepping down from the interim agreements - partly therefore, the expert says, because the Iraqi leadership is divided into views on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, with regard to the Iranian stubbornness towards the international community in the case of some of the proposals it actually agreed to at the beginning of October, I think it brought in the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together on a trip that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran on December 31 to respond to the proposals before returning to the search for other elections, including surveillance, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions."
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations condemned on Thursday what it called "unjustified and unfounded accusations" to some members of the Security Committee on Iranian nuclear activities, stating that it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to reach a proportionate long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before he flew to the Kurdistan region, oil-rich, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
There is persistent high tensions between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, mainly because of borders, ownership rights and income distribution.
The Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potentials for the conflicts to prevent the US plans to limit the number of US troops from 115,000 to be 500,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dampen Kurdish concerns about the lingering depression. The official posts of the US quoted Gates as saying to Massandaa Barzai, the president of the Kurdistan regional government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In an ageing China, a change in the course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters read that "Mother of the Earth is too exhausted to support more children" and "One extra child means one extra grave."
Then they learned the lesson that when the official government posts in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and the ageing population in their city, they suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their response was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all of our time and energy to just one child.
We haven't saved anything for others, says Wang, 31, the human resources manager who has an 8-month-old son.
China's more than 30-year-old policy of having only one child has been introduced, creating two generations of only notoriously chubby and pampered children, the affected "little emperors," the country's population crisis is threatened by a population crisis.
The average birth rate dropped to 1.8 children per pair compared to six before the Vpolice went into effect, according to UN figures.
The breakdown of the population, where the population at the age of 60 and above is predicted to storm up from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is of larger, wealthy coastal cities with a higher-educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and above accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai-registered residents, while the birth rate was smaller than one child per pair.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for the Population and Family Planning, said many couples must have children to "help the proportions of an ageing population and a reduction in the manpower's numerical strength in the future."
He says it's about "beo old doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden."
Gradual soothing
As it was put into the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably still the most controversial mandate, established under the Communist Party.
The pair that violated the policy faced immense fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
Chinese official posts advocated a policy that helped the country prevent critical use of natural resources, while human rights advocates were condemned to advance the policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to submit to miscarriage at the second child.
Moreover, many couples had to have sexist-promised abortions, leading to an unnaturally high proportion of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have been gradually more lenient in their opinion on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they generally allowed a list of exemptions - including city dwellers, members of national minorities, and cases where a man and a woman were only children -- and in 2007 they relaxed the diction of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the University of Beijing's Population Research Institute, said that central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to incitement to more births.
Almost overnight, the posters, urging the parents to have only one child, were replaced by copies of the regulation detailing how it would be justified to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city administration sent out officials to plan families and volunteers to meet couples in their houses and to whack the fliers under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who chose to have more than one child.
The response was cold, family planning officials said.
A purifying response
Even though officials in an country town around Shanghai have seen an increase in interest in couples who would like to have a second child after the campaign trail, most city districts did not report changes.
The city's Huinan district with a population of 115,000, for example, still registering four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of the city born in 2010 is still expected to be only around 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee at the Shanghai Quarter of Caol said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people did not want to have more children.
They want to provide the best for the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said she would like to have two children and have been legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, who have only inadequate health and life insurance, provided by the government.
Without a docile hampma, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the west are judging the one-child policy wrongly as a contentious legal issue, says Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is in union with her first child at the seventh month of pregnancy.
Yes, we were deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It's about the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, the human resources manager, says he only wants one child, because she was also an only child: "We were the focus of our families' attention and we were all caring for us.
We were not used to provide care and we didn't really want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, 42, who the gherder translation company, made it much more open.
For double-chicled parents in the middle class who have reduced the birth rate, he said, to be successful is to be selfish.
Today's 20 and 30-year-olds, growing up, view parents as breaking through the first days of the Chinese experiment with capitalism and don't want this kind of living for themselves, he says.
It is one child who places enormous demands on the time of the parents, he says.
A mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the contentious issues of the propartment -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You must have resumé ready at a time when the child is 9 months for a good preschool.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, says Che, but not with two.
We are the first generation with higher live standards, he says.
We do not want to bring too many sacrifices.
The UN Group has outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The United Nations sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching unruly attitudes and mutual reclamation -- looked again on Friday at the release of a document that proposes an ambitious reduction in the amount of greenhouse gas over the next 40 years with industrialised nations bearing most of the burden at the earliest time.
The text, which can provide a starting point for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, emphasises the remaining obstacles as it illuminates the way forward.
But you could see important progress in the negotiations that took place at the wrong time with the world's more than 100 world leaders who will come to Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN Working Group on an ad hoc basis, this text subtletely states how much money rich countries should provide to those poor to deal with global warming in the long run and over the long term.
And it provides an entire array of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies so that they can limit their carbon output and what the upper limit for the rise in global temperature that policy-makers will still be able to tolerate.
This adds a great deal of flexibility to the process, says John Coequyt, the chief executive of the Washington club, Sierra.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, described the condensation from the 180 pages of the text in the meeting to focus on what a top official on climate issues at the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, described as a "great picture."
It outlines a possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions to between 25 and 45 percent by the year compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions to between 15 and 30 percent during this period.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by 2050 to between 50 and 95 percent.
The European Union deliberately discussed on Friday the promise of providing $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries accept adapting to climate change -- from managing floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
But he still gave Friday the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevailed in last week's interviews.
US Special Ambassador for Climate Affairs Todd Stern rejected the speech calling for a binding reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries compared to volunteering among the major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The shift signaled that the Obama administration had established a tougher line against China by officials from the Bush administration just two years ago.
The United States will not accept the treaty without the transfer of major developing countries and implementing the actions, said Stern, who also complained that the text was not sufficient to ensure the restrictions and should be vetted by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after Chinese Deputy Secretary of State He Yafei told the US chief climate negotiator that either the lack of "colsel's sense" or "extraordinary irresponsibility" led earlier in the week to say that the United States would not help financially China to deal with global warming.
With the economic path of the world's major powers at stake, the wrangling has erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current struggle is mostly to preserve individual economies rather than to preserve the planet, between China and the United States, to meet their respective commitments, while the poorer nations point out that the two dozen of the world's most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to carry out more forceful actions.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate to Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the major powers were fighting over who should bear the cost of curbing greenhouse-gas-related, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in finding the way to prevent large issuers from taking responsibility at their actions.
It is clearly a game about the new economic hegemony being developed, said Ulate, which also serves as a regional adviser on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international conservation.
Some of the countries that are the most vulnerable to climate change have indicated that they would like to continue to push for a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants said that the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states, which has 43 members, created a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who has conducted international climate negotiations in favor of the European Commission, said that the promotion by small island nations "carried out the political tumbled in the entire field-wide process" partly because they are now united and demanding action from growing economies like China and India.
The hearing raised new urgency as soon as the delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining contentious issues before the heads of the governments competed for the agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as India's Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China's Deputy Minister, withdrew from the planes and ran through the Bella Center's halls to the closed doors of the meeting and the new conferences so that they could set out the demands that would be assessed next week.
The vastness of the gathering - with 13,000 people moving from and to the convention center on a daily basis, guitar-playing activists staged at night with an ironic spectacle of countries they thought had been sent to, and the hand-to-hand forwards was passed on to paper rather than by e-mail -- controlled by challenge.
The intensity is only a superstructure: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen and earlier on Wednesday 60 heads of state.
We have come into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the Deputy Minister for Global Policy at International Conservation.
Heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first train 140 miles per hour redefined his feelings this Monday
at 5:13 a.m., on Monday morning, the whistle cut through the darkness to mark the departure of the train that revolutionised the British traffic.
The country's first high-speed passenger train will reach speeds of 140 miles per hour and will fly from Ashford, Kent, to London's St Pancras, to cover a distance of 58 miles per 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister for Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and boarded the first high-speed passenger train outside of the Lord of John's.
It hopes that the new service will possibly link Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great agglomerations of Midland, the north and the Scottish Republic with London.
The worn-out stagnant waters should be reduced by passenger and business travel times, and the transition from aircraft and cars to the rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties were allowed to be won for this vision.
But the tens of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable fight for projects and environmental disruption concerns have now hampered the building of British high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide a feasible study to the government, forwarded its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, as the Times reported.
It provided a detailed map of the routes of another planned high-speed network stage.
London's new route of the West Midland route was designed to five metres in urban areas and neighbourhoods, where it could be problematic to reach the life's vault.
In the open countryside, the final route was scheduled to reach the 25 m.
HS2 also envisages setting three options for an extensive North-based high-speed network.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred choice is the reshuffling of the shape of the letter Y, with one high-speed line to the western Midland.
The line should be divided near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It looks like the most powerful choice has taken place," he said, and the railway expert.
As soon as it's done, the journey times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than 1 o'clock in the present.
The proposals should allow trains to run at 2250 miles per hour, making the UK network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line is already proposed to hinder trains of 400 m , which would be able to carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains could operate every hour on the London-Bunmingham line.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if needed.
In view of the capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would be expanded to confer a high-speed network.
Experts from the rail industry argue that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intended to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultations and planning procedures mean that the kech will not make the final decision before the general election.
Even if it sets the wheels in motion, the network should be built in parts.
Trains should first be put into service not on high-speed lines, but in the existing lines north of Birmingham, and keeping the journey times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is seen as a crucial contact point for ensuring the switch from aircraft to trains, a landmark for the revolution on the railway.
Taxpayers have paid out £75,000 in Tory Orangement
Alan Duncan, the holder of the Tory front seat bench in the Chamber of Deputies, was paid by the taxpayers thousands of pounds of the cost of the last year for the orangery he had built in his home in the constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living "in rations," increased his mortgage to £75,000 to build an oak-clad extension in his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month to the taxpayer.
The municipal authorities approved the claims in time and so he was not questioned by the Sister Thomas Legg who inspected the member expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan made his demands "would have been a quicker or simpler one."
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns two-storey houses in the village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The houses are worth approximately £1 million.
There is a kitchen, a living room and a dining room on the ground floor, but the IRS has agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added a conservatory to the house, which is labeled "originry" in the plans.
Neighbors describe it as "greenhouse for fun and treat."
Mr Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last check by the Municipal Standards and Privorizo Committee in the last mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month that he had broken the rules, after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the pentillary security to a mortgage of £271406 from his estate in London to a house in his constituency he bought in 1991, the year before he became a member of the House of Commons.
Documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan claimed around £1,400 a month in the interest of the mortgage until March last year.
In April, his demands increased to more than £1,800 a month.
Mr. Duncan's RBS mortgage repayment interest could not have changed at this time, suggesting that all of this was intended to finance a loan of £75,000.
The standard RBS mortgage repayment variable declined from 7.94 percent to 4 percent in March of this year in March of this year.
The latest document from the municipal authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1,250 a month in May this year.
Mr. Duncan left his job as the shadow leader of the House in September after a secret newspaper filmed it and said that MPs must survive "admissions" after the spending scandal.
"In principle, it's nationalized, you have to live on the ration and be treated like a s**t."
He said, "I've spent the money for my garden and my claim and a small fraction of what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't do it."
The MP, a millionaire from his former career as an oil trader, was first asked to explain his extradition in May when it became apparent that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, before the IRS was approved, that it "may be considered excessive."
One of the activists dug a pit in the shape of a pound emblem in Mr. Duncan's lawn in protest after it was revealed that he had claimed 4,000 pounds for three years.
When he was asked last night about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said, "It was because of the capital increase, which was approved by both the IRS and subsequently Legg."
He added: "it is not a contentious question of hiding and zigzagging or breaking the rules or something else.
It's an absolutely straight downline line, by the rules, justified and that's all.
This would not be able to be many other sorts of cleaner or simpler."
Come and see the cottage on the brighton coast with the Advent calendar.
Coastal cottages in Brighton found a new meaning of life in the up-raising months as an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that inspires ducal activities with creativity called on the 24 owners to decorate their cottages for every day in December and to use the Christmas rounds as the theme of this decoration.
The event began on 1 December, when it allowed visitors to see the last cottage from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. every day, and a biscuitic sandwich and mulled wine, provided free of charge.
The carols selected included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, when the cottage presented the work of Janetty Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, an assistant at television marketing at Hove, is a non-acconciseean priest in the Diocese of Chicherster and head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion much more important to the people of post-Christian society.
"Why are we, as a church, expected to see people coming into a strange old building? I feel that the church should come to the people and serve in a wakeful.
"The idea Advent Calendar in the cottages was created as a conversation with some friends during the dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place, and we tried to try and present it to the spiritual way."
Strong mobilizations in Copenhagen and the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday, demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen, where hundreds of people were arrested by police on that occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and a hundred thousand, according to organizers, rallied in cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference to adopt an agreement by Friday that could enter into force on 1 January 2013, according to the organisers.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate climate conference, said that the growing global mobilization, of which the current ralions is clear, contributed to the "political tax" of any failure in Copenhagen that would be too high.
According to an AFP journalist, the incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the parade began, with a group of about 300 demonstrators dressed in black, beginning to smash the windows with cobblestones and hammers.
Riot police immediately intervened emphatically.
In total, police announced the arrest of between 600 and 700 people and clarified that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks," of ultra-aradical separate groups that had already been manifested in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without the difference" and stressed that about a hundred of them were in handcuffs and sit "hanged in the streets on Saturday night ", despite the extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the procession calmly went in the direction of the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
Demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to penetrate.
A podium was built for the speakers, before which a cleric candlelight meeting took place with the participation of the former Archbishop of Cape Town of South Africa, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to Africans, there were a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue cape, formed their first rallies in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of the Earth group to create "blue waves" for the "fair climate."
Today we are taking to the streets to demand a settlement of environmental debt in favour of the south, explained Lidy Nacpil, the Philippine fighter at Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't tell each other anymore: it's time for that, Benin singer Angelique Kidjo claimed.
In Africa, rivers and watercresses are drying up, today we can walk in them and that was never possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of a UN convention, the Fight for a Next World movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP Jose Bová, one of the figures in the fight for another world, said he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate and social justice." "There is currently no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world."
The first rallies began in the Asia-Pacific region, which find many islands particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, organizers say, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
Several hundred people marched in Manila, mostly students, in red clothing and scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, the Yakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred protesters took to the streets, demanding strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in the "350"-organised protests, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva, several dozen people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia condemns it as a 'farce'
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, Tbilisi, on the other hand, declares the move a "farce."
About 131,000 people were invited to participate in this first election after the Russian-Geerinsk War in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
The polls closed at 17 hours of GMT.
According to officials from the Abchazian Electoral Commission, the turnout was 58% a few hours before the polling stations closed.
The first preliminary results should be announced at night from Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including the incumbent, Sergei Bagapsh, categorically reject the idea of a merger with Georgia that condemned the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has completely fallen into Russian supremorbitement," said his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of the territory with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it to be part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia, after the conflict in 1992-1993, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia is trying to show through the election that she is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, a new era for our independent state, Kvarchiya Svetlana, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted to the vote for President Bagapsh, told AFP.
She was one of those who came to the polling station at a school in the capital, Sukhumi, to a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian rule is the main issue of the presidential election in this region on the Black Sea, which can boast beautiful nature.
Across this small country of 216,000 residents, huge billboards are being placed with Bagapsh, alongside Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime MinisterVladimir Putin.
In Gaul, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to oversee the successful conduct of the elections received a warm welcome from the district mayor Beslan Arshba.
"We, the Abkhaz, are grateful "said in a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support and, in particular, its decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, said Aleksey Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian Parliament, toasting with a glass of vodka.
The opposition, which was represented in the election by former vice-president Raule Khadzhimba and two traders Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the treaties concluded last year with Moscow, such as a treaty that allows Russia to control the Abkhazia railway network for a period of 10 years.
Fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he supports neither the current government nor the opposition.
To win the election, an absolute majority of 50% plus one vote is required.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive contest must take place within two weeks.
Climate: World rally, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday, demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested around 700 people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and a hundred thousand according to the organizers, rallied in the afternoon in the cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, on an agreement that could come into force on 1 January 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the procession calmly went in the direction of the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
Demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to penetrate.
A podium was built for the speakers, before which a cleric candlelight meeting took place with the participation of the former Archbishop of Cape Town of South Africa, Desmond Tutu.
According to an AFP journalist, the incidents occurred shortly after the parade left, when a group of several hundred demonstrators, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to smash the windows.
Riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened without waiting, several manifestants being knocked down in the process.
In total, police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, clarifying that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks," ultra-aradical separate groups that had already been seen in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg in eastern France.
Late in the afternoon, one police officer on the jaw was injured by a cobbler and four cars near the squat near the incidents were set on fire, resulting in the arrests of about 20 people, according to police sources.
We are concentrating on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Yakobsen warned, while police helicopters flew up again.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from the major German cities, London, Amsterdam and Milan were of European origin.
But there were also a lot of Asians, including several Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue raincoats, formed their first rally in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" as a "fair climate."
Today we are taking to the streets to demand a settlement of environmental debt in favour of the south, explained Lidy Nacpil, the Philippine fighter at Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't tell each other anymore: it's time for that, Benin singer Angelique Kidjo claimed.

French MEP Jose Bová, one of the figures in the fight for another world, said he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate and social justice." "There is currently no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world."
Oxfam has called in several well-known figures, such as Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN Refugee Commissioner Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first rallies began in the Asia-Pacific region, which find many islands particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, organizers say, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people rallied in front of the City Hall of the Philippines capital, mostly students in red clothing and scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several hundred demonstrators also met with a demand for a strong measure against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in the "350"-organised protests, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva, several dozen people gathered.
Geography and history items will be strengthened as part of the general grammar school reform, Chatel said.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said on Sunday during an interview with the JDD journal that the subjects of history and geography will be "strengthened" as part of the general grammar school reform, even though their teaching will no longer be compulsory in the final year of the grammar school with a focus on exact sciences.
Now all second-grade students will have four hours a week and for all the same programme from the general culture, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "it is necessary to quit hypocrisy" because, according to him, the S specialization is no longer focused on exact sciences" but "basically there are the best students in it."
The specialisations of the EC and L cannot be for the kind of sub-specialisations, he continues, stressing, "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would have made it difficult for themselves to learn geography and history in the final year of professional grammar schools."
A survey by the Ifop agency, published by the daily Humanité on Saturday, showed that seven French people out of ten (69%) disagree with the government's project to abolish compulsory history and geography in the senior year, as a result, many intellectuals and teachers have criticized the abolition, both the left and some members of the right.
The minister, on the other hand, added that "it is not an account" of abolishing the philosophy in the specialization program S graduation.
At the same time, Luc Katel defended the reform in the education of teachers, while 16 organisations (students and unions) called for participation in Tuesday's mobilization against this project, which they believe will sacrifice the pedagogical education of future grammar school professors.
As part of the Master's degree 2 (M2), he will undergo an entrance exam focused on their field at the beginning of the year and another testifying to their ability to teach at the end of the year, the minister explained.
They will attend professional internships during their second year of master's degree and will perform as a professor-steriist in their first year before the pupils.
If you add up all the internships you will be offered to you before the admissions process, you will get more experience with the pupils, almost 300 hours, continued.
The minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education," which does not yet exist in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to cancel the school map by 2012.
At the elite University of the École normale supérieure, experts have 15 minutes to convince themselves of the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the goals of the Copenhagen Summit: this is a challenge announced on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, the vice-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Climate Experts on Climate Development (GIEC) at the instigation of the University of Ecole normale supérieure on Ulm Street.
As one AFP journalist reported, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a one-day seminar of 15-minute contributions from experts to be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something to draw people in and on the basis of which they would be more inclined to learn more, explained on the occasion of the conference 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, which was named after the fish from the local pool, which was named by the students.
About 20 contributing experts from the various scientific disciplines will be selected and the selection is based on their charisma.
Climate warming "we can talk for hours, but we can also summarise the basic targets in a few minutes" said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke in front of fifty listeners without pre-prepared comments, using only graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed with the hope that the audience will recognize that "the Codan conference is underpinned by a very serious scientific foundation."
Videos filmed at these lectures will be placed on the school's website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" seminar is scheduled for February, and more will be followed with regularity every two months.
Paying delays: angry prison guards, planned measures
The union of the prison guards announced a "general mobilization" on Friday, as they are demanding that their premiums and overtime be reimbursed by the Christmas holidays, the reimbursement of which has been deferred to January for financial reasons.
The Prison FO (2nd Conservation Department) has asked staff who will not be on duty to attend a demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prison facilities and to "knock them down" to alert them to "theft of their wages."
The CGT for the prison guards (the sector's 3) called for them to "request rallies in individual prisons and start a major mobilization" with the 'flatth and unacceptable' that "over-time and supplements for work at night, Sundays and holidays" not be paid for in December.
The first union of the guards, the Federal Union of Prison Supervisors (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for the overall mobilisation (...) in order to show dissatisfaction and indignation."
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime increased a lot in 2009 and not all were included in the financial budget, but assure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari had sent a memo to the prison guards' union assuring them that the payment would be made next month.
I know of the efforts that prison staff are making to ensure the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, the minister writes in her memo.
I have ordered the administrative directorate of prisons to take immediate measures to prevent the situation, which arose from a poor assessment of the overtime, in the future, Minister Alliot-Mari added.
December's pay will therefore be low, with the exception of the managers receiving the famous bonuses for performing their duties and fulfilling their goals, says Ufap/Unsa, and for those "it always finds a place in the budget."
It is simply a scandal, the FO inter-regional union in Marseille was outraged and announced its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and subpoenas."
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or holidays unless the supplements for these days of October are reimbursed in December, as well as overtime, the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne is also threatening.
At a time when we are being given more and more work and more tasks without being given available to us by additional staff, it is sad to allow the lowest-ranking staff to pay for it, says the CGT-prison guards in Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of them are better off than others.
However, in any case, the funds of the e-G.S. were little stated by the Secretary-General of Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
Obama says he's giving 'better gifts' on Christmas' than the ones he's getting
US President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family at the White House, confided to Oprah Winfrey's "goddler" screen that as far as gifts are concerned, he has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than the ones I receive."
The president and his wife, Michelle, spoke in a special edition of the show, which will air on ABC on Sunday night about how they are about to spend the Christmas holidays and the end of the year at their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion gets his gifts.
Santa Claus also likes Boa, said Michelle Obama, noting that the dog will also receive "of course" a gift, according to excerpts from the pre-transient broadcast of the show.
And Michelle Obama also objected to her husband's claim on the quality of the gifts she receives: "Oh, no, I gave you a great gift last year," teased the president.
Well, of course, that's true, the president was forced to agree, but immediately afterwards he pointed the finger with humor to the pearl necklace of the first lady: "Who did this give you?".
In this one-hour, very relaxed show with the famous presenter, who worked hard to support Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, Mr. and Mrs. Obam called for their most popular donors, which they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a 10-step gearbox, but also a basketball league given to him for Christmas by his Kenyan father, whom he rarely met.
I remember seeing my father, who came to see us for Christmas and give me the basketball, the president told me.
It wasn't until a long time after that I realized that he had actually given me the ball.
The first lady was remembering the dollhouse again.
I didn't even know how to organize it all in the little house, so I lined up all the furniture along the wall instead of placing it around the fireplace, but I loved the little dollhouse, reminisced Michelle Obam.
Johnny Hally day re-adjusted, RTL says he's in artificial sleep
Johnny Hally Dressed in Los Angeles due to "injury" after a major surgery he underwent in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his closest, while RTL reported that the singer was in artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-open on Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors noted the "injunction-based operation" of the sprawling disc he had undergone in Paris on November 26, his press office told Paris, saying that these lesions required a "repairs operation."
However, the singer's press office sought to reassure the public and said the situation was "under-check" and at the same time announced that a new medical communiqué would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, which is the lead partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday has been put into artificial sleep to avoid "painting and complications."
In 48 hours, when the patient opens the eyes, we'll be a little more confident, RTL adds.
The press office, when asked by AFP, did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also states that according to "some sources" no drain was placed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated on at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for a sprained disc.
The surgery, which had been scheduled a few days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well known in art circles.
But the doctor was unavailable on Thursday to comment on RTL's information.
After the surgery, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection that occurred after the hit.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said on RTL radio on Thursday that his friend was going through a "bad time" but added that he was "not worried about the rocker" because he was a big "fighter."
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing a stupid thing because spending 12 hours on a plane after an operation like this is no joke, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, was reassuring the situation, who said that Johnny Hallyday would "respond well to antibiotics" and that the infection had been "stopped."
Mr Camus also said that he had met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had noticed no particular concern.
The singer's health problems have only been multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after he crashed on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday had been operated on for a "small small-grown tumor" and then a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour of the "Tower-66" which is presented as his farewell.
But since then, every medical problem of his has been highly monitored and commented. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team had to re-exammit the news of the new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/Small pool: premiere of Bousquet in his favourite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Championships in a major swimming pool, won the title on Thursday at the 2009 European Championships in a small swimming pool in a discipline he particularly likes: a 50m freestyle.
On the first day of the Championships, at which overalls are last allowed, only three world records were set, although many more were expected.
One of them beat Hungarian competitor Evelyn Verrasztová in the 200m semi-final and the two remaining men's relay team of the Russian in the 4x50 m positional race.
A great grief for Bousquet, who was striking for the world record at the 50m freesty world record, which he already holds in the large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, at which the premiere was started by ten swimmers instead of the normal eight.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergei Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20) and he had not set a record.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if the world record is in my reach, I will try to do it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore jumpsuits made of polyurethane, which will be banned from 1 January.
The jumpsuits have helped to 238 world records since February 2008 and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first to be hosted at the same competition in 1999.
The use of the jumpsuit did not help Germany's Paul Biedermann, the two-time world champion in the summer in the big pool in Rome, who had the world record at his fingertips.
The young swimmer failed to break the 400 metres freestyle record (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time of his career (3:34.55), over Russian driver Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't give it my all in the race.
I knew I would not break the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I fulfilled my task.
Lobintsev will be a serious contender for the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: Zola's Romanesque sarcophagus record was auctioned for $1.5 million
A record of a Romanesque sarcophagus that belonged to none other than the French writer Emil Zola was auctioned for US$1.5 million on Thursday, which is significantly more than estimated, said art dealer Sotheby ́s.
The price of this two-metre-long and 63 cm high front desk, dating from the third century A.D., was estimated at between $150,000 and $250,000.
Marble "representing four Dionýs scene in an elaborate architectural décor, surrounded by satyars and bakchants is a rare piece, there are very few such pieces in the world, perhaps four or five," Florent Heintz, Vice-P.17 at the auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian arts, told AFP on Tuesday.
The work was sold among hundreds of others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it is the object to which it was perhaps the most bidder, Sotheby's spokesman, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
The fact that Emile Zola acquired this marble was found a few days ago.
The record was in Rome for almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borgia family and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorelová, who decorated with her a bathtub at her private hotel in Paris and at Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic of the Republic of France and briefly the President of the Council before the rise to power of Marshal Petain.
She stayed there for about fifty years.
Florent Heintz discovered while searching the Louvre Museum's database that the record was part of the "sunremises of Emil Zola" opened since 1903, a year after the death of the author "se Raquin" and the frescoes "Rougon-Macquart."
Interrupted attempt to leave President Zelay to go from Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico decided on Thursday that the conditions for the transport of ousted President Honduras, Manuel Zelay, to whom the rebels refused to give a safe exit guarantee, were not met.
After a phone conversation with President Zelaya last night, all indications are for the time being that there is no way to make this transfer, Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, said.
The Mexican government plane that flew back to El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya, the Directorate-General for Migration said.
The government of the putschists wanted to force President Zelaya to "demisi" and to apply for political asylum abroad, only to give him the possibility of a safe exit.
But the omined president rejected those demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as the exiled head of state.
The post-Petrio government "did in another failure when it wanted me to resign (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Globo Radio on Thursday, in which he often commented on the political crisis that has been in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, added the overthrown President, hidden in the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months, and played a few chords.
The embassy of Mexico has asked us to provide a safe transfer guarantee, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not include an asylum application, the Interior Minister of the P landsman government, Oscar Raul Matute, said on Wednesday to the Honduranator's HRN radio.
I will not seek asylum for any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with the Telesur station, which is based in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
The rumors of Zelaya's departure were mobilized on Wednesday by supporters of the ousted president who came to gather around the embassy of Brazil, where the military stepped up protection.
Brazil's foreign affairs minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the putschist government.
They show their marginal stance on international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who became close to the socialist Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, was toppled with 28. June, the day he organized public consultations in preparation for his re-election against the recommendation of the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
He unexpectedly returned from exile in Costa Rica on 21 September and found refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he comes out of here, he will be arrested and will answer for the crime of the "high treadmill" he is charged with, the putschist government says.
The Puppet President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election to replace President Zelay.
In the controversial election, recognized by the United States, but convicted by Latin American countries like Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya's return to power until the end of his mandate on January 27.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance prompts optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended with an increase on Thursday, and the US trade record results suggest a rise in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final deadline, the Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 and the Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06.
The Standard & Poor 500 index improved 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market focuses on "a half-full glass."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly focused on the US trade balance numbers, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter."
The U.S. trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, had expected an increase in the deficit.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, especially the export of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of the United States' main trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week, unemployment rose against all expectations, and the number of jobseekers reached 474,000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has fallen "for the lowest this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The securities market has also fallen.
The proceeds of the state treasury with a view to 10 years increased to 3.482%, compared to 3,423% on Tuesday night, and the return to 30 increased to 4.492% compared to 4.408% the day before.
Cuba : hundreds of regime supporters booed "Ladies in white"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime booed the wives of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day on World Human Rights Day on Thursday, for which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About forty "Dam in white," wives or close political prisoners were drugged right to the street by supporters of the regime of Raul Castro's regime on their march toward the center of the capital, demanding the release of political prisoners, the journalist reported.
Out with the Yankees!, "Jubs!!", "The Street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" the regime's supporters of the dissidents chanted with a raised fist.
Dissidents were eventually escorted by plainclothes members who arrived to "secure security."
The day before that, there was a similar rally in Havana against "I'llad in White," but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in Havana's Vedado district, plainclothes police officers were detained by the plainclothes police, who were also preparing to rally on Thursday on the occasion of World Human Rights Day, a journalist told AFP.
According to this journalist, police loaded dissidents who were drugged by supporters of the governing regime into civilian vehicles using force.
The arrest of dissidents in similar conditions lasts only a few hours from the rule.
The 2005 Sakharov European Parliament Prize winners "Ladies in White" organized an unauthorised march for "fling all of them, according to dissent, about 200 political prisoners," said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
Cuban authorities consider opponents to be "mercenaries" or "agents" paid for by their mortal enemy, the United States.
A miracle done, Cuban television reported on Thursday's rally of the governing regime's advocates against the "opponents of the revolution."
Cuba, with the Communist Party at its head and the one-party government's policies, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of disregarding human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
The madman killed an 80-year-old man with a knife and injured 5 people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A madman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at peak times on Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary results of the investigation, the assailant, aged 28 allegedly assaulted an 80-year-old man in or before the pharmacy with two knives and for unknown reasons, to 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of the police and witnesses.
The badly injured old man, born in 1929, died of his injuries in hospital, according to the Police A-A.
In this pharmacy or in front of her, the attacker then attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
The husband, aged in his 30s, resisted and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital in which an 80-year-old man died.
The second injured man's life is in danger, according to police sources, the vital authorities were apparently hit.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to the hospital "in shock," a police source said.
The armed man, who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as a police source said, then fled to the street, still on boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He wounded two more people, apparently by accident: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old man, the other man seriously.
How all this happened is not entirely clear, as it all took place in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives he carried across the crosses behind him, the head of the Alliance syndicate at Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé, said at the scene.
Several passers-by, including young people, attempted to stop and disarm the lunatics, according to the testimony of the gathered AFP.
I saw a guy in a 30-year-old green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed to do so because he was quite strong, commented Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
He was rushed by a crowd, including a city police officer who had broken his wrist in the process, he added.
Still at the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the level of 61, two city police officers, including their commander, attempted to detain an armed man while injuring them, a police source said.
The incident occurred in one of the main streets in the Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passers-by came to tell me there was a wounded person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and noticed a big stomach wound, Frederic Allione, a 30-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person in his 30s, who also had knife wounds, came in.
A man who was not carrying identification documents was eventually arrested by state police.
The public prosecutor in Nanterre referred the matter to the investigation department of the Hauts-de-Seine Regional Police (SDPJ 92).
The suspect attacker was taken to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody awaiting questioning.
A police source did not rule out his placement in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said it was needed to handle him at the police station in Clichy, where he was taken.
He was "completely out of touch" like "all lunatics of this type, whose strength in action increases ten-fold ".
US: Polanski's lawyer again asks for an end to the prosecution
The lawyer for the Polish-French director, Roman Polanski, reapplied in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States) on Thursday to halt the prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence over the moral affair that took place 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the director's attorney for the film "The Pianist," criticized the two-city district's appeals court in California before three of the court's trial at the time of the events of 1977.
I demand that the prosecution be halt now and immediately, said the lawyer Hummel, adding that, out of the conduct of the judge who ruled on the matter, Laurence Rittenband "waved his spine."
According to him, the judge (who had already died in between) was alleged to have dealt with the prosecutor before the verdict, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison – a serious offence against the rule of law.
Information about this interview appeared in the documentary "Roman Polanski: desired and wanted" (Roman Polanski, sought and requested), from the mouth of the prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally stated at the end of September that he had "limed" the author of the documentary.
In case the court refuses to halt the criminal proceedings, lawyer Hummel will demand a trial to be held in which he will be able to produce evidence of his claims.
The prosecutor reiterated what had already been said at the first state, namely that there would be no serious study of the request to halt the prosecution until Roman Polanski came to court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before the court handed down its "illegal sexual intercourse" case with a teenage girl aged 13.
He has never entered the United States again since.
A deputy prosecutor in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the trial."
In this case do we want to say not only to Roman Polaski, but also to other defendants that it is possible to escape? asks Mrs. Asayam.
He is of the opinion that the director "requires the court's kindness while despising his authority."
One of the three judges who now have 90 days to take a decision also stressed "that there are other alternatives to escape."
The lawyer, Hummel, was not alone in asking for the prosecution of Roman Polanski to be discontinued.
The victim's attorney, Samanthy Geimer, also asked again for the prosecution to be completed.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear the eternal harassment every time the Polanski case surfaced, adding: 'No one in this room can say that the trial was fair'.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on orders from the USA
After more than two months behind bars, he was released to house arrest at his cottage in Gstaad, where he is awaiting a possible banishment.
Wall Street ends without a direction, held back by the rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without the roll on Friday, with the market fumbling among indicators that are better than expected in the US and a rising dollar price: Dow Jones won +0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final deadline, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points and the Nasdaq, with technological dominance leaving 0.55 points and finishing at 2,90.31.
The Standard & Poor's 500 increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,166.141.
Frankly, the market is very calm, said Mace Blick Blsilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of trade has decreased very much and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by publishing economic indicators that are better than expected and which "helped improve the mood in the market in terms of stability of economic recovery," summarised the Charles Schwab analyse.
In the US, retail sales rose by 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month, and far more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate from the University of Michigan index, US consumer confidence also returned, rising strongly in December to 73.4 against 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the indices were hampered by the new increase in the dollar price against the euro, which is the highest in two months, "pushing downward-looking sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technology stocks are losing ground.
The securities market has fallen.
The yield on the treasury with a view to 10 years rose to 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday night, and with a 30-year view, increased to 4.497%, compared to 4.492% a day earlier.
The choice of Miss World again in South Africa.
After a month's travel across South Africa, the Miss World's 112 candidates for the title pageant on Saturday set to cross the target mark to reach their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
This great beauty celebration was held in the vicinity of Johannesburg for the second year running and so far five candidates have won the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargboo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Mae of Canada were chosen by Miss Sport or Miss Top Model during their African sojourn.
It was a true whirlwind of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Houseurban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things and I have so many experiences!, she confided in Miss Sierry Leone.
The competition, which takes place in South Africa for the ninth time, will be broadcast live from Midrando, in the north of Johannesburg, from 5 p.m. (Fr) time.
I couldn't dream a more beautiful country in which I would put a crown on.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy I could have experienced it twice, confided Miss World-World by Ksenia Sukhin, in the hot south-fainting summer.
For the young Russia, her second stay in South Africa was in the spirit of numerous meetings with the other candidates and the new discovery of the country and its "rashlands that are taking off their breath."
After a month of performances, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss page is now focusing on the competition itself.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to go in the steps of Priyan Chopra, elected in 2000, who is also taking part in the election by Aishwarye Rai, the winner of 199199, who both became stars of Bollywood.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman's dream, but it's not just about appearance.
We are an ambassador for my countries and I want to come home with the crown, says Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th edition will be carried in the spirit of music and dance.
The candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in a swimsuit.
The show will be presented by Chinese TV host Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World Committee chairman Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with a warmth that is difficult to cope, said Julia Morley, the president of the Miss World competition.
As last year, the candidates took part in safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on a bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Unusual to the president, Miss Sierry Leone noted.
Undoubtedly the most beautiful memory will be the draw in Cape Town (in the southwest) for the World Cup, which will be held in June 2010, which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could have met people I never dreamed of.
I will definitely return to the 2010 World Cup, says with enthusiasm for Miss Italy Alice Taticchi.
According to David's son, the reports of Hallyday's condition are "very positive."
Reports of Johnny Hallyday's condition are "very positive," as his son David assured us on his arrival at Los Angeles airport on Friday, where he had flown to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It is very strong and everything is going very well, said David Hallyday on his way off the plane, arriving from Paris moments after 1 p.m. local time (21pm world time)
The singer's son, who appeared calmly, said he would "as fast-moving" report to the Los Angeles Hospital Cedars-Sinaï, to which Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday to post an in-authorisation infection sprained by the inter-breach disc he underwent in Paris on November 26.
According to a press release, the singer's night in Los Angeles was "left into artificial sleep" to prevent pain and facilitate the administration of treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was a doctor at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles to be put into artificial sleep. The hospitalization was due to an infection after an operation for an out-of-breaking intervertebral disc conducted on 26 November in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be operated on again during the night from Wednesday to Thursday.
According to the AFP photographer's information, his wife, Laeticia, attended a school performance of the French Lyceum in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by their daughter Jade.
The head of the orthopaedic surgery and trauma department at the la Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, reported that he was leaving for the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer heavily accused Déphane Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Surgeons from Los Angeles have said they are outraged, M. Camus.
I've heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday"listed too quickly to Los Angeles, with the permission of his Parisian surgeon."
I spoke to the doctor in person by phone and he assured me that this trip was no problem, which surprised me greatly, as I myself had already suffered from the win for the intervertebral disc twice, he added.
He had said at the RTL radio station a moment earlier that the singer had apparently left after a Paris operation without a drain, without anything."
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well known in art circles.
He operated on the actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic he was on at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg in the removal of a hematoma, resulting from a cerebral hemorrhage.
But he is also a dark-home reporter, convicted several times in medical malpractice cases, tax evasion and fraud.
The medical association's attorney for the medical association, Olivier Metzner, called him a "no scruples" who is "regularly" summoned to the medical chamber, and who cannot be "far recommended."
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux commented on the matter through his lawyer David Koubbi.
He reported that the procedure was "completely good" and the post-operative examinations were "normal."
The operation was not of a haemorrhagic nature, so the introduction of the drain was not necessary," he added.
The singer's health problems have been mounting since this summer, and in any case his next tour seems to remain with a question mark.
It is obvious that the date of the resumption of the planned tour on January 8 (in Amiens) appears to be too close, Camus said.
UDF's tens that increases the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre to no longer take their shortcut.
UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançoise Bayrou, responded to the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morino, the president's attempt to take advantage of the former Giscard Party's shortcuts, saying he must not use the acronym in any media outlet under threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to appropriate the acronym UDF, saying that François Bayrou did not deserve to be carried by his heritage after he extended his hand to the left.
The Defence Minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the Nouveau Centre (NC) National Council.
This move received support from the Hervé de Charett (former za-UMP now for NC), who is crediting his ownership of the UDF brand, having first been registered at the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriété industrileelle) in 2004.
But on Friday night, the UDF Association committee, run by friends of François Bayrou who has no intention of being expropriated, withdrew from his silence and made a formal request to both the minister and the MP to stop using the abbreviation and to forward the ownership of the trademark, under threat of prosecution.
In recent days, you have increased the disturbing statements that you will propose to your political movement +joke the acronym of the UDF+, writes the Association in its letter, signed by 19 of the 24 members of the committee, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez by the MoDem, or Senator Jean Arthuis of Alliance centriste.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place the name+Nouveau centre+ on your movement's welcome website, with the slogan +UDF today+, the letter's signatories also note.
As you know, you have no right to use this abbreviation, explains the UDF Committee, which asks the NC"movement to immediately remove all references to the name UDF from all promotional material, including (his) website."
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette "to hand over the ownership of the trade mark to the legitimate owners."
If you do not do so, we will go to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories point out.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement in 1978 "and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "elected" leaving in 2007 " to create a competing movement, as others did in 2002, to establish a UMP.
The Nouveau centre therefore has no right, according to them, to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la demonçaise).
At the same time, they recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join the MoD for three years and to create a committee in charge of defending the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues "when he registered the trademark," he was "not a member of the UDF for three years" but UMP.
He scandalally and fraudulently used the non-existent acronym registration to do so on his own account.
This indiscretality is beginning to be transformed into a criminal offence, they claim, and then, ironically, commenting with NC's strategy: "It seems to us that both in politics and in everyday life it is more valuable to create a name for itself than to withdraw from the anonymity by the fraudulent acceptance of a name to which we have no right".
Liliane Bettencourt's case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for misuse of a state of weakness.
Nanterre's court on Friday decided to try the artist François-Marie Banier and pass judgment on whether he had used the eighty-year-old billionaire's weakness to deprive her of part of her fortune, as her daughter, Liliane Bettencourt.
The photographer (62 years), known for his photographs of the famous, will be on trial on 15 and 16 April 2010 for the abuse of a state of weakness, a crime for which a maximum sentence of 3 years and a fine of €375,000.
This decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in a case that can be described as the family saga of one of the richest families in France in which the mother and daughter are attacked and the fight for the management of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, to be carried out by a college of three doctors.
The heiress and the main shareholder of L'Oréal have always refused to undergo such an examination, certainly not under the terms offered by the prosecution at Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should produce a report by 10 March 2010 and at the same time submit comments on whether Liliana Bettencourt could have been in a state of weakness and in which period.
I think he'll go through with it.
I will speak to her about the matter, Ms Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said after the hearing.
As for the lawyer for Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, the court's decision was welcomed.
It's an excellent message(...). Expertiza will show that he has been manipulated by this old lady in need of protection (M. Banier), confirmed.
It is two years since Lilana Bettencourt's only daughter opened criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and an all-artist who she accuses of using her mother's long-inel of weakness to obtain a gift of €1 billion in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or paintings by the masters.
Liliane Bettencourt, on the other hand, has always denied being manipulated by the photographer she considers a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the legitimacy of the lawsuit filed by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the attorneys' court appearance at times changed to the family hour of the truth.
Liliana Bettencourt's lawyer made three letters to her notary (in 1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she expressed her mistrust of the husband of Françoisa Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt adds, according to the attorney,: "you could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
Ever since she got married, I've never been able to talk to Françoise."
The prosecutor's office in Nanterre reunited that the complainant's actions were not justified, all the more so because the guardianship judge had these days rejected her request to open the legal proceedings for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully able to attend the court, is not under protection or custody.
No one else will act for her," confirmed the prosecutor's office, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court ultimately decided to comment on Ms Bettencourt-Meyers's legitimacy at the time of the start of the trial.
A management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the big French companies, our fight to develop economic intelligence was pointless...
For more than a decade, it has been a reminder of the behaviour of large companies' management towards employees' approach to consumers before the marketing revolution: the point is for co-workers to identify with the "values" destined for the mountain, as was the case before, when the consumer had to be forced into the products that emerged from the ideas of the factory technicians' heads.
By becoming the center of business companies, the customer has compared the marketing revolution's market-extraction strategy in the right direction...though the authoritarian efforts to impose products, different from customer preferences, are returned on a regular basis!
The employee's passive approach can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon that employs predominantly managerial cadres.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all the intellectual functions of society, including R&D, and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "requires from all stakeholders (...) an active approach and the ability to anticipate" and requires staff commitments that are completely at odds with the revenues of authoritarian management.
We therefore call for a managerial revolution, which should aim to put workers at the centre of interest of the company as well as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls.
Internal opinion polls - as a questionnaire submitted to Orange's employees - will contribute to the revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I have already convinced myself that in the face of the new situation, the structure will return after different digressions to the first priority to... what she has always done!
Furthermore, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, is increasing in proportion to the seriousness of its own failures.
Finally, because most of the managers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of colleges for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For reasons of thought convenience, they adopt an old behaviorist theory, now reanimated by the "unhearsal" from the US and widely disseminated without much knowledge of the scientific institutes and the media.
With the fact that it is possible to move the "pitch" of managers' involvement, a recent Ipsos survey showed on the website Figaro.fr, which only confirms the managers in their position of mechanical management, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobility factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolutions necessary for the proper functioning of modern businesses presupposes the adoption of a final vision of human behaviour.
It consists of incorporating a basic observation into all the intentions and practices of management: For employees, commitments to the business will only be possible if they appear to be a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of employee motivation is only addressed by studies Motively functional analysis.
These studies have shown to evaluate their businesses on the basis of a predetermined doix that allows them to assess what it offers to realise their life's goals through an image that says the business.
By identifying and measuring these mobility factors, executives can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and bring their human resource management "on the right paths."
This creates the breeding ground for the development of solid and effective economic intelligence.
By addressing: "just war" by Obama's praise from the right.
On Friday, the American right welcomed a speech Barack Obama's speech the day before in Oslo, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner had defended the concept of "fair war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who at first mocked the award of the award to Obama 9. October, this time the presidential address was applauded, including Sarah Palin, the former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin, the muse of the right-wing Republican wing, told USA Today, adding that she herself had expressed herself on the subject of the "sometimes necessary" wars in her memoirs, which are just coming out.
War is, of course, the last thing the Americans would like to have to work with, but it is necessary.
All terrorists need to be detained there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from his predecessor, George W. Bush, on Thursday in Oslo, justified sending forces and used a speech to clarify his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days before.
Obama's next opponent, Newt Gingrich, assessed that the president had done a "very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated by the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the President's reference to the "existence of evil in the world."
In a way, I found this speech entirely historic, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway."
The former MP, whom some consider a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was delighted to be seeing the "leftist president" to be reminded of members of the Nobel Prize committee," that they themselves would not be free to hand over the Peace Prize award if the use of forces did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, the former author of speeches, George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama gave a "very American speech."
Not only did he introduce himself as a "salt citizen" as he always did, but "he spoke as the US president" and reminded Europeans of " that they live in a safe bubble they have not created themselves, and that they are not doing too much to preserve," Gerson assessed.
The few right-handed discontent include the Bushh-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, who called the speech "united, pompous and without inspiration," as he reported on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, the Democratic representative, Dennis Kucinich, is appalled at the sight of Barack Obama justifying the use of forces.
"If we wrap the war in the cover of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the mid-left press holds a laudatory view of the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to find the award of the Peace Prize to be premature to be to Obama, it has rated its output as an "excellent" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide to international decisions in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression," the California daily reports.
Obama "came to the speech for what it took," the New York Times assessed, and called the speech "as simple and enlightening."
Road carriers: three marathons to an agreement to save the supply of supplies for Christmas.
Three merger marathons, the union of road hauliers and the TLF, the only employers' organisation left to the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening to end, ending the call for a strike and a threat that hung over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
The Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, expressed his "celebrity" at the signing of the agreement on Friday after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of the discussions, the negotiators split early on Friday morning with the hope that the text of the agreement would be signed as quickly as possible at the end of the morning.
This is despite the fact that three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew from the meeting.
But it took another more than six hours of a meeting, which began at 11 o'clock to all agree and sign the agreement at 6 p.m.
This conflict would "wild businesses do very much" and "there would be a danger of the holidays being disrupted at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text contains a 4% wage increase for the lowest salaries (for local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest salaries is increased from €8.72 to €9.06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort behind it, Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
Tonight, we're going to order our members to avoid blockades, no blockades of supply centers.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not satisfied," he added.
Philippe Grillot, the president of the TLF, welcomed the "right agreement," although it was difficult to admit a high pay increase given the international competition ".
According to him, there will be an increase of €170 a month for the lowest wages and by €100 to €120 for the highest.
It is an agreement of common sense and respect for employees, CMaxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historical agreement."
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is a "acceptable compromise."
The agreement also foresees a revaluation of travel expenses of 3% and a report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010 which will also allow a focus on the 13th salary and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled the "lowering of €100 million in taxes on business wages" which was the subject of the government's amendment to the draft law on the 2009 budget, which was voted on on the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate for a "significant" vote.
The signing allows this agreement to apply first to the undertakings that are members of that organisation to the whole field, in the event of an extension by the Ministry of Labour.
It will take place "at the earliest possible date," Bussereau assured.
The whole process can only be hampered by the opposition of employers' organisations.
The FNTR talks of a "bad trade" as €100 million "the sector has already been offered as part of the carbon tax to compensate for part of the carbon tax."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to act in an emergency not as a result of the analysis with the result of a mutual analysis, but to avoid fading turkeys' eaters at the time of the upcoming Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
For Otre, the agreement is at risk of "burying a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field" in the next 12 months.
Suburban trains RER A: disruption of transport at the weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the transport company RATP.
The intermission of traffic on the RER A commuter line, which is the largest line of the city's public transport in France, will continue over the weekend, as Friday's talks between the unions and the RATP management did not lead to any specific results on the issue of the premium's request for the second day of the strike.
On Saturday and Sunday, the days of the important shopping weekend before Christmas, the trains will only run between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., every other train will run on the main stretch (between La Défence and Nation), with only one of the four trains on the main stretch, on the main stretch (among the La Défence and Nation).
The link with SNCF will be interrupted at Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to transfer to another train.
Galeries Lafayette's commercial homes, which are expected to be over 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP was trying to secure a link with the big department stores."
The RER A line runs from the west to the east of the agglomeration of Paris.
The RATP line runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one of the two was in operation at peak times, and virtually no train was running at the time off-peak, as planned.
As on Thursday, the people of Ile de France arranged differently and there was no confusion on the platforms.
So early in the morning there were far fewer people than usual at the Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station, among other things because the pupils and students were missing.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, a 29-year-old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he had risen "an hour and a half earlier to be sure he'd arrived on time."
Saint-Lazare railway station was not overcrowded, the state railway SNCF announced, as a larger number of order administrators and vigilantes were predicted.
Suburban RER A-bound trains operated by SNCF in the direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station with a metro stop.
The strikers' next general assembly will be held on Saturday and Sunday to assess the results of Friday afternoon's meeting with the management, which the unions have rated "weakly."
The RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for the RER A suburban trains in all respects, the organisation of working hours, the course of careers, etc.
However, this is not the issue for drivers who are demanding the deserved bonus, according to Thierry Garon (Unions Jih).
RATP even postponed the premium proposals for the time being, which scored the accuation of the CGT, saying that the management "did not be able to solve the problem, while travelers and SNCFs did: well."
At a new meeting scheduled for Monday, "they will review the conditions of the profession more closely," RATP said.
Which was the reason why the union's union thought the business was "smoking fun of the weekend's passengers."
In the morning, about 150 drivers were seized by the company committee at its Paris headquarters.
The leadership, which until now has so far rejected any discussion during the strike, has therefore decided to meet in order to "reassuble."
There is a danger that the conflict will spread to the RER B line on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Independent announces a strike alert.
The unions are asking for a premium of €120 to €150 for €150 of the variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants (Independents)) and make it difficult for them to deteriorate working conditions on this route, which carry a million passengers a day.
Drivers of the RER suburban trains earn between € 2200 and €1,700 of gross wages and €600 and €650 in premiums for irregular hours and for work on Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish judiciary has dissolved the Kurdish side, and this decision carries severe consequences.
Turkey's Constitutional Court decided on Friday to abolish the country's main pro-Kurdish party. This decision immediately triggered protest demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can greatly complicate the task of a government seeking to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it became a "nest of activities threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Chief Justice Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of negotiations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, with the need for the dissolution of the party with a majority-seven votes, Kiliç said, adding that 37 party cadres, including its president, Ahmet Türk, and MEP Aysela Tugluk, were banned from participating in political life for a period of five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Türk and Ms Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of the 500).
The party's leadership had already warned before the verdict that MPs would rather leave Parliament rather than act as political-affiliated MPs.
The decision is a continuation of the trial initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation, Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obedience to the "guides" of the Workers' Party of Kurdistan (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that DTP is a legal political case for the rebels of the PKK.
The party assures that it has no "basic association" with the PKK, but refuses to label it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court's verdict comes as the government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand, offering a series of measures to strengthen their rights and attempt to limit the support of the Kurds against the PKK to end the conflict.
The DTP leadership confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to a resumption of tensions in the southeast of Anatolia, where many demonstrations have degenerated in recent weeks against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is detained to clashes with the police.
Since the announcement of the justice decision, thousands of demonstrators have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast that are inhabited by the predominantly Kurds.
Police used tear grenades and water cannons, and protesters threw Molotov cocktails or fired rocks from slingshots.
Also in Istanbul, about a hundred people demonstrated.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said that the decision of justice would only be "defected by despair."
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (the Kurds) with a ban on the party, he said in the press.
The government, formed by the party emanating from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We are out of principle against party disruption.
It solves nothing, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a complete shade of democratic proposals launched by the government, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we may see a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for one of the most deadly attacks in the north of Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
Snow may come
Pretty crunchy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he would like to bully citizens, says the head of the FES Technical Services Department of Winter.
But to allow its employees to test and learn to control all the vehicle technology.
This could happen for the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
Over 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of the snow and ice.
In doing so, the FES is proceeding according to the exact plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt across the board and temperatures drop below zero, they will go to 20 so-called A sections of the high-end A, Brauburger explains.
These sections include the main and transit routes as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, commuter public transport lines, pedestrian areas and descending sections like Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at 3 a.m.
If necessary, it is necessary to sprinkle with moist salt in a maximum of three hours, which holds, something like 1040 kilometres.
That's why the FES starts at 3 a.m. at night, "to make the roads open when the right to start work."
It's difficult when it only starts snowing at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the Winter Technical Services Department, "because no one is willing to make a place for the sprinklers."
Only when they are not so snowy are the driveways and interconnection communications, which also include Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is for the side and the secondary roads.
Brauburger knows they'll be complaining.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES infantrymen set out, with preventable places and crossings being cleaned.
FES usually can't take care of all bike trails.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that mainly monitors bridges from 22 to 4.30, says Brauburger.
As ice is forming fast on them, the sprinklers rides out as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
If necessary, the police will also call them.
Cradle of the dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: The two-meter-long animal ran at two thick hind limbs, with a long skull with sharp, curved teeth, short forelimbs with sickle claws and a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing out of the ordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas, Austin, and colleagues in Thursday's edition of Science magazine, the journal, write that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body traits.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in the equatorial dry dry area of the supercontinent Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window to earlier evolution of the dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about kinship relationships, the prevalence and the signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavations at Ghost Ranch in north New Mexico.
Sometime in one day we found a dozen dinosaur bones, this is unprecedented for the sediment of the Triassic Triassic, team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah reports.
Some of the bones were identified by scientists quickly as a new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains from a total of five individuals.
The finding is confirmed by the theories of the early history of the dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the Sun God of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it's an unusual find: "The dinosaur fooses of the trias are very rare, mostly there are only individual fragments."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
This finding is not particularly sensational, but it confirms some of theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
In the current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared some 230 million years ago.
But a lot of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of pradininaurs is mostly questionable.
Experts discuss, for example, when the lizards split into the three most important developmental lines: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyranranosaurus rex, Velociraptor, and also the birds, the "long-digit" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the herbivores Ornithischia (take-off) that included the likes of Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is the original therapy after analysis by Nesbitt and his colleagues.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, researchers found, for example, evidence of aerial bags that even the offspring of the teropods of the birds have.
The air sacs make bird breathing more effective than mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since a related line of huge sauropods later also had air bags and light bones, this useful innovation was probably created by the common ancestor of the two groups.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the most recent known dinosaurs were living in South America, scientists inferred that the lizers had first appeared there.
According to this, the three developmental lines were divided soon and spread from South America to all the continents that formed a single earth mass at the time as the supercontinent Pangea.
It would also be said for the fact that the team, along with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not especially closely related to the theatres.
The three of them can't come from one common, embedded ancestor, the scientists argue.
We believe there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the scientific study.
There are, of course, contradictions.
One of the elderly species, Silesaurus, which belongs to the group of the most difficult dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His conjecture could put together a distorted image, because very many primitive dinosaur fossils have been preserved in South America, with rare occurrences on other continents.
As the dinosaurs proved, that they evolved from the relatively rare secondary line of the genus of the rebel to the ruling vertebrates on earth in the days of the Earth's Middle Ages, it remains a puzzle.
During the Triassume, the dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
Around the end of the triass, the dinosaurs spread around the world and evolved many new species, while relatives died out and the interface of the triasse and the jury.
The history of success did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs had adapted better, so they could push out the competition.
The history of success did not last forever, anyway.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped another group of animals that had also developed into the trias and had lived in the shade ever since: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors at the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna, and Berkeley in California.
Docors from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen joined in.
The police eviction of the occupied casino of Frankfurt Goethe University has caused a worldwide uproar.
The 278 professors and teachers of the University of Goethe, as well as universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America, have been solidarised with the protesting students at the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "didn't praise" a presidium-sponsored police intervention.
With the scribbled walls and works of art, the university's president, Werner Müller-Estler, had the building occupied by striking students and lecturers last week.
Five students were injured in the process.
Damaged things, the signatories say, do not justify the "violent dissolution of self-organised teaching of students and teaching police commandos."
The eviction represents an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedoms of research and science.
The unobtatical focus on vandalism is used to "unjustify the protest" and distracts from the contents.
The precision avoided the necessary discussion.
Lecturers are calling for a halt to the prosecution.
It is claimed that most of the strikers did not support the material damage.
A legitimate protest
The youth of the trade union Verdi and the German trade union are also solidarising with students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one's own future, says the mysterious Earth Youth, Verdi Alexander Klein.
Meanwhile, the Hessen Minister of Science, Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), has defended the advancement of the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the University President.
Destroying and casting are completely unacceptable means, she said at Aktuellen Stunde (Actual Hour) at the Wiesbaden Landtag on Thursday.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we have no sympathy for vandalism, said the member of the Member of the Landtag for the CDU, Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and Linke saw it.
The CDU takes the painted walls for an excuse to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of looking at the arguments and demands of the learners, there was a vacancy.
Linke has filed a motion calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For years it paid for a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the west.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union it was a strictly guarded site where secret weapons research was carried out.
Today, this county with 216,000 people, 37 kilometres from the Moscow city centre, is considered to be the "Russian Silicon Valley."
There are significant micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres.
Since September 2008, Green Nuclear Representatives have established contacts with the Frankfurt science center Riedberg - with the university institutions and the firms of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There have been several mutual visits and on Wednesday they signed the "Protocol on close cooperation" in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg.
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow's Vice Mayor Yuri Rosljak and the Prefect of Zelengrad, Anatoly Smirnov, and was signed by the head of planning officer Edwin Schwarz for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in science research will go to the seminar in Zelengrad.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
The FIZs will be allowed to take hold in the growing Russian market.
Russian science firms, on the other hand, want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronics, the large concerns Sitronics and Rossiyskaya Elektronika.
The county was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literated translation "The Green City") has acquired its name from the wooded hilly landscape, which is planted with research facilities.
Stuttgart brake
The Stuttgart 21 dimension is not at all prepared enough.
For the project's fans, this is quite simply a 'new heart of Europe'.
Okay. The S21 is more than the launch of the station, a more than monstrous structure that will plunge the capital of Baden-Württemberg into desperate building chaos for a century.
Stuttgart 21 was made up of the spirit of the 1980s.
The track stations that ended up in the city centre were then considered to be the 19th-century transport and technical fossils, which act as the brakes of modern rail transport, as it took an enormous amount of time to cross the locomotives from the rear of the front.
Go, stop for a while, keep going - that's how it should work.
And that's why the head stations are disappearing: Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies about halfway along the route of the Trans-European Railway Infrastructure between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan about the "heart of Europe."
It is actually starting with the S21, although the 1980s' visions are no longer compatible with reality.
Very ambitious designers themselves recognized that in the Hessen and Bavarian cities, the start of construction was almost unfunded.
Since modern shuttle trains with motor and control vehicles have existed at both ends, the head stations no longer have trouble getting through and leaving.
Still: Starts with Stuttgart 21, including the new ICE to Ulm track.
It was pushed by the country's and municipal politicians.
The tracks cooperate, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state group.
Urbanistically, the project can still be excused in some way.
There will be a new urban space that - if we believe the designer's computer images - will contain a lot of greenery.
The railway transport system is the S21 harmful.
The passable railway station and the construction of the line are for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980s - was credited with a huge increase.
Back then, there was no competition for cheap flights.
But a modern transport policy must be about strengthening freight, because rail transport is far greener than the lorry on the road.
But the new line is not suitable for freight trains due to the steep climbs.
More seriously, the S21 indirectly touches on a lot of other rail projects.
The good six billion euros were to be buried in the Swabia.
That's the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be a shortage of funding for other knotty points and bottlenecks in the network.
There are sixty larger projects on the Department of Transportation list.
One of the most important is the construction of the roughly 180-kilometre-long route through the Rhine valley.
It has been built on this route at a slow pace since 1987.
This would have been where you'd need a hard push.
But the S21 will be a brake.
The line through the Rhine valley will become the throat of a bottle of international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government examines airport ruling
The country's government has left the Wiesbaden Landtag open to see if it goes against the ruling of the Hessen Administrative Court of Justice (VGH) regarding the ban on night flights and will have it revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to legally assess the more than 400-page VGH ruling, said Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
VGH in Kassel explained in writing today that the state would have to re-regulously modify the night's ban on flights in the event of the planned northwest runway runway of Frankfurt Airport.
The permit for the 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as foreseen by the Landesseek, does not correspond to the statutory protection of the population against the night air noise.
The Coalition must decide by 4 January if it will demand a revision of the judgment.
The opposition criticised the postponement and railed on the representatives of the government to renounce the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD faction leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and the FDP to revisit the promises it had made to banning night flights it had made before being elected. Otherwise, it is possible to view it as "violating a given word."
It's bloody hard if you can keep your word, said Greens boss Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's election slogan, "We're keeping the word."
Minister Posch rejected the rebuke of Schäfer-Gümbel, the Land Government is trying to get to their night's flight by "overwhelming the law and tricks."
A precise legal check needs its time.
The Coalition does not want to work on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His faction's remarks to ban night flight days have never been as being given by the opposition.
US banks repay their aid
American, crush-shattered big banks are getting rid of state bonds.
Bank of America repaid aid from the Tarp Banking Rescue Fund at the same time on Wednesday, totalling $45 billion (around €30 billion).
According to a report by US-based CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to repay the state aid.
The Constitution thus wants to get rid of the restrictions that were made by the adoption of money - a reduction in the payment of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America has procured $19 billion in net money from investors thanks to convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the sums from her coffers, which were filled with, among other things, thanks to trade unions.
Kenneth Lewis, the bank's chief executive, explicitly thanked the US taxpayer on Wednesday night: The money injection helped us through the difficult time.
The cash institution was hurt at the top of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup wants to be exempted from its liabilities to the state by procuring money in the capital market.
CNBC, citing sources, reported that the US bank could have announced a capital increase of around $20 billion earlier on Thursday.
A Citigroup spokesman would not comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley already repaid the aid.
Quick Choice
It was going faster than expected.
The station introduced its successor just two weeks after the board of directors forced the editor-in-chief, Nikolaus Brender, from the office.
Last night, the board wanted to settle on that person.
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of ZDF Studios in the capital in Berlin.
But the station has not confirmed this - officially, to avoid overtaking the process.
But the role could also have been played by not wanting to harm ZDF intendant Markus Schächter if the proposal failed with the board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the board.
The result of the vote was not known before the deadline for this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter crashed on the board of directors with his proposal to extend his contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven against him. Brender's loss of mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, though it was to be expected.
Indeed, a EU majority on the board had signaled weeks before the election that it did not want to confirm to Brender in office.
The opposition to the editor-in-chief was orchestrated by Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to remain in the high-geriled editor's office by arguing that the ZDF news broadcasting watch quotas had fallen under Brender.
Until shortly before the election, protests were therefore being sharply criticized in which political influence on the ZDF was sharply criticized.
The last time, 35 legal lawyers were involved in the debate, who view Koch's action as unconstitutional.
It was no good.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romanistics.
He then worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey went to ZDF, first to the "heute-journal."
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal editor-in-chief's personal officer; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; leading and presenter of "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 head of foreign policy ZDF; then head of ZDF's main studio.
After being deposed by Brender, who was voted the expert Medium Magazine journalist of the year on Wednesday, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional lawsuit.
Koch's opponent on the board, the Snitch-Falco Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal states should amend the state treaty with ZDF so that the intendant's personnel proposals could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also refused to expel party politicians from the ZDF supervisory boards.
Brendner's presumed successor, Peter Frey, commanded the board with a clever chess move - the board strongly criticized the board for this immediately after the removal of Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, he could nominate him for the position of editor-in-chief without losing his face, so he could be elected by the board of directors without getting under the suspicion that the party's partisan had been pushed into office.
In the party's arithmetic, Frey is ranked as a left-wing liberal anyway.
Studying gets rid of junk
Partial success for students: After a year of striking, the ministers of culture finally went to the Länder on Thursday: At the conference of the Ministers of Culture and the university rectors, both sides agreed that there was a will to improve the learning conditions for bachelor's and masters.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the load on the tests: As a precaution, each study module should be completed by one single test.
In addition, the workload of learners should be checked and a 'real and defensible degree' should be guaranteed.
To do so, policymakers and colleges want to simplify the recognition of exams between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Land commits to creating a more flexible, joint structural award for bachelor's and master's degrees of study.
Earth's deviations should cease to exist.
Fewer trials
Since the start of the student protests in the worm, the culture ministers and the university's chorek had winged words about better study in their mouths.
Now, for the first time, they are filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Board decided to reduce the number of examinations in part drastically: "Each module will usually be completed by one test," the 30-page report reads, partly to regulate the approval of the fields of study.
"Significantly lower exam burden," said Reinhold Grimm, the chairman of the Accreditation Board, to "beat the erroneous development that significantly reduced the difficulty of the study."
This is to say that the "introduction of studies" in the future is to be a "decisive criterion" in the implementation.
Modules and contents must be "must be hard to check" so that "unnecessarily do not restrict learners in the election
seminars."
Students would have a "a step on the space that allows and supports their own initiative."
The rules are to apply when approving new fields of study, but also for existing fields of study after review.
These need to be "re-credited" every five years – but this means it will take until 2015 before all the fields of study are reviewed.
Responsible for this, there are ten accreditation agencies throughout Germany, which are subject to accreditation boards set up by the Länder.
Culture ministers called on the "strongly" federal states in October to act on the agencies in such a way that the subject matter of the subject was not too great and the exam regimen was not strict.
In the various Länder, universities and universities have already agreed with the provincial ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country so far, the Rhineland-Palatinate has pledged additional resources to further develop the Bologna Process.
With the money, universities should primarily cover consulting programmes and study consultancy, and to strengthen the test and foreign authorities.
That's what countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on.
At the beginning of 2010, the administration wants to submit an amendment to the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
According to her, only one single test should be needed to terminate the study module.
The format of the study should be even more flexible, in order to guarantee the recognition of exams from other universities and to make it easier to make the Masters available.
By the end of next year, the complexity of all fields of study in the country should be reviewed.
The government and the opposition were again arguing about the country's learning conditions on Thursday.
In addition to the praise, criticism of the resolution was also criticised.
The Federal Board of Directors of Juso Higher Education Groups called for the creation of education policy not to take place in the future "behind the closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
After the strike at the latest, "at least a word should speak in this" students as the persons concerned.
Future academics also received support from the president of the Conference of Higher Education Rectors (HRK), Margreta Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students," she said Thursday at a meeting with culture ministers with whom HRK consulted on a joint reform report.
According to the Education and Science Union (GEW), the Bonn resolutions have not gone far enough: They demand a legal claim that would give each graduate of a bachelor's degree in a master's degree in a master's degree in a master's degree.
Second, the federal states must ensure that for today's Bachelor's students, there are enough places available for today's Bachelor's degree courses tomorrow with the best possible learning conditions, said GEW board member Andreas Keller.
The Lands must employ far more lecturers.
But the culture ministers have not commented on the free access to the Master's programmes.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Getting to Germany and out is nice, almost no control..." reads the opening line of the poem of the poet Werner Söllner, who, in this ragged linguistic piece, themes the experience of arriving at the time of one dissident who gained his freedom but also lost his linguistic environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in the Banat of Romania, working first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing house, then relocating to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner was awarded various literary awards, and he gave poetry to the legendary Goethe University of Frankfurt in 1993, and has been head of the Hesse Literature Forum in Mousonturm in Frankfurt since 2002.
A considerable off-line commotion was made last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, which was "German literature in Romania in a mirror and a broken mirror" mirror."
The obviously insecure and subdued Söllner left a statement in which he was in front of fellow writers by the Romanian Germans, among others. Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, he admits to the cooperation as a secret informant of the Romanian secret service, Securitate.
Together with some of the presenters, Söllner won the German Language Prize in 1989.
Attempts to recruit were said to have begun unobtrusively, not until 1971.
I am, Söllner continued, "that is, someone who has not resisted sufficiently the attempted intimidation by the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is undercover agent Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize to Hurea Müller and her unparalleled literary dealings with the mechanisms of the dictatorial government, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that marks the depths and infamy of a political sympathic based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if this can be said according to the current state of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but he is also a victim.
In the Securitate acts, secret agent Walter played a role, Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession, referring to the positive effect on the undercover agent Walter.
He "cut me out" at the time at all the points of boreholes, says Markel.
It has a moral obligation to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in this form and in front of this audience, but absolutely surprising, the admission of the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Herta Müller wrote in July, when she read her own briefings, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the Leopers of Securitate.
The perpetrator, one can assume, will speculate, and in some cases I think, to know which name is behind the code name of Sorin, Voicu and, most of all, Walter.
In the Czech Republic, meanwhile, a very certain inspecting of the files of the Stazi, the manipulation of the survivor of the Securitate control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic enlightenment has been undermined and curtailed.
One of the Birthler authorities, which corresponds to the National Council for the processing of the Securitate (CNSAS) files, was only established in 1999, the issue of the act has been rather lengthy since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law that governs the administration of the components.
That the former members of the Securitate still have a lot of influence in Romania, one interview was documented after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta, in which one of the former Securitate chiefs from Timisoara was dismissive of the award winner.
She is said to have psychosis, after all, she was questioned only once.
The disgrace of power was expressed here quite indiscriminately in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, there are inevitable questions about the Söllner case, as in the context of the hindered offense.
Why now? Who hurt? The audience's special reaction to Söllner's admission is to be expected to be determined by the continuation of this chapter by a desire for knowledge rather than for the indictment of guilt and shame.
To the geneis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Carried deposit by the Champions League
It was as if a clean-dressed sales rep came from a cute Christmas party handing out a sportswear manufacturer of candy while boarding a quarter of an hour after midnight to the summoned C-C-Class Mercedes, the new coach, VfBr Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange-colored sponsor's bag. "
The man with the striking bald bald man had been rushed around him for a strange city.
Otherwise, he could drive himself - the alcohol was not in play, and the 55-year-old man was not drunk enough, too.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the job will be continued.
Or it's just beginning.
In the words of only three days of the committed Swiss: "We reached the last eight," that is, in the Champions League thanks to a 3-1 win over Unirea Urziceni of Romania, "but we must not be dazzled by success: It will be a brutally tough fight against the descent."
"A near-more important assignment" faces us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the royal class in Mainz even in an ordinary league day.
And to avoid the obvious weaknesses again after three quick goals from Marica (5), Träsche (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
draw
Champions League final eight (match on the 16th/17). + 23./24 February/Courtesy matches 9. + March 16/17) will be drawn in Nyon on 18 December.
The joy of the onset of Babbel's successor will therefore remain intact.
Not just for the supposed healer, who gave the insecure Stuttgart professionals their confidence, willingness to be put in commitment and the joy of the game to a short time.
I went to the players and told them that they were supposed to focus on their strengths and encouraged them to be bolder, explained the soul healer Gross so simply-sounding a successful recipe, but hea no longer showed any effectiveness under the therapist Babbel's therapist.
He stirred up a certain magic, Babbel's liaison, Jens Lehmann, admitted, "when a new impetus comes up in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't think possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a multi-week break from an injury, became the best player on the pitch because of his dynamics, tried to describe the found "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the new supervisor's work practices: "He is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
Za Babbel was clearly missing it.
VfB Stuttgart not yet rescued, warns sports chairman Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs but more constancy.
Like Gross, the players and managers don't want to overestimate the victory against the weakened substitute and utterly overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would have won in Glasgow before a nasty awakening came after a 0-4 defeat at Leverkusen, Khedira muses.
And the sports chairman, Horst Heldt, recalled that while one goal had been reached in the season, the other was still a long way off.
We're not in the clear yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate on his 40th birthday after his first home victory in three months was caused by the weekend's events, which were newly revived in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others and not Jens, Heldt replied to the harshly criticism of Lehmann.
He was hailing the board of directors of the weak lead and decided to change coach after pressure from the teenage fans.
Even the fact that he was cancelled on his day off after the matches was marked by Lehmann as a sign of the lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's statements "formulate pure egoism," Heldt replied, announcing the implications for the goalkeeper.
The two 40-year-olds will probably have no more joy in life.
Anyway, they're one with the others that without the job of a deposed coaching team, it wouldn't be possible to play a strong and combative performance.
Babbel and his assistants had a "great share of the success," say Heldt and Lehmann in unison - and the man agrees with the plastic bag.
Battle of the World Heavyweight Championship
Passionate duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of world champion Vitaly Klitschko.
However, after 12 hard-line rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title of the WBC boxing organisation.
The referee's verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitaly Klitschko remains the heavyweight boxing world champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated the American Kevin Johnson in Bern on Saturday night with points (120-108, 120-108, 119-109).
For Klitschko, this is the third successful title defence since his return in October 2008.
Prior to that, the Ukrainian was twice WBO and WBC world champion.
Unfortunately, it didn't turn out to be what everyone expected.
Klitschko improved his record to 39 victories in 41 professional duels, having been defeated twice by injuries.
Challenger Johnson was defeated for the first time in the 24th fight.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Bernsk arena, the 2.02-meter-high Klitschko duel was driven primarily by his left-handle.
The 11-centimetre-taller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, was pulling back before the world champion's strokes, so that Klitschko could not deliver a decisive blow with his dangerous right.
In all, passive Johnson did pretty little to the challenger, and he was just trying to get to the next rounds.
Klitschko did provoke words and gestures, but his strokes rarely hit the world champion.
Even so, it is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought Klitschko for a full twelve rounds.
The challenger took care of the commotion in the Swiss capital before the duel.
He insulted Klitschko as a "addly zombie" that "can't do anything properly."
During the eighteague on Friday, the champion was provoked, pulling off Johnson's sunglasses "so he can see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's return
Klitschko remained after the fourth contest after his return 11. October 2008 undefeated.
After a nearly four-year hiatus, he defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back "his" WBC belt, which he had to hand over before without a fight.
He defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba in defending the title of Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September by Chris Arreolo of the USA.
In this fight I only got one shot and physically in good form, Klitschko justified a quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to be the defence of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF world organisations.
But the WBA belt is worn by Britain's David Haye, after dethroning the 2.13-metre-high Nikolai Vulajev from the throne in November.
Haye canceled a duel against Klitschko in the summer, scheduled for September.
He is reportedly planning a duel against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
A leading attack from the opposition: The head of the Greens faction, Jürgen Trittin, called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar about poor information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and Linke (Left) are calling on the chancellor to provide an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the Kunduz raid, the opposition believes that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) committed conscious deception.
The minister said "consciously untruely untrue" on the bombardment of the two tankers in September, the head of the Greens faction, Jürgen Trittin, on the ARD's "Tagesschau" news program on the ARD news program.
Call it the usual expression: He lied.
The order for the killing was issued in disregarding the rules of the International Security Forons of the Security Forners in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO, read by Mr. Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it emerged that the attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
The US raid, which was requested by the German commander of the Kunduz, Colonel Klein, suffered as many as 142 people, according to a NATO investigation.
The Greens, the SPD and Linke called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to immediately comment before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Mrs Merkel must explain if the targeted killing strategy is part of the Federal Assembly's Afghan policy - and if the Office of the Chancellery, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Greens' colleagues, Renate Künastová, called for.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected the criticism.
The chancellor's office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
Doubts were also raised in loud Saturday about the Department's trial of the background to the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL's information, both of them informed Guttenberg correctly and completely of the background to the attack on the tankers.
Officially, it was said that they should have denied the existence of NATO reports and withheld the minister's sensitive details.
However, it was said from around the two top officials that they had even alerted the Ministry of Defence to several reports, among them a two-page document by the commanding Colonel Klein and one of the military police reports.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert should have asked in the letter to clarify the situation in the meantime.
It is noted that he has not yet received any response.
The ministry did not comment on the criticisms on Saturday and pointed out that this would be dealt with in the Investigation Committee of the Bundestag, which will be established next Wednesday.
Worlds of Dreams
Some see images in the waking state and hear voices that others can't see and hear.
It is not only for the mentally ill or in the drug intoxication that the boundaries between imagination and reality come together.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything's fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we are allowed to surround ourselves with the wildest fantasies and fantasy delusions.
But those who experience dreamlike states in vigilance see and hear things others cannot see and hear, are mostly in the Western world today for a fool or a drug addict, or at least a weirdo.
However, such images and voices are not only made for the mentally ill or in the drug intoxication.
Our imagination is to blame: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint or write novels take care to see to it that they blend the boundaries between dream, of the idea and the reality.
Houses of a changed state of consciousness can occur in a variety of forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worse delusional.
Although the initiator and effect may vary, the vision of the mystique Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet New-Age Carlos Castaneda, the shamanic states of delirium, psychossees and hallucinations can be derived from such trials.
Hallucinations or visions arise if the balance of the neuronal transmitters of the brain is derailed - mainly dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - and the interaction between different parts of the brain is canceled.
Comprehensive hallucinations and vicious thoughts occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity doesn't have power over him
The link between the delusion and the dream employed philosophers and doctors from antiquity.
Aristotle understood the hallucinations as a form of waking dream, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, stated in 1861 "a great similarity to raving with dreamlike states," for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "psychosis, with all nonsense, mirages, deception of the senses."
It's the fall of 2001, Henning T. is turning into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and garishly colourful.
Gravity has no power over him, it floats at the ceiling of the room.
He feels kicks.
Behind him, winged devilish figures with blood-red grimaces, his teeth cherishing.
He's being chased, kicking him with heavy, fiery shoes, throwing it against the walls, feeling the pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices are threatened from the walls and on the radio.
He can no longer endure the voices that call him and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo, smokes them into a loop and attaches it to a hook on the ceiling.
He steps up on one speaker and puts the noose around his neck.
Junk.
The loop loosens.
Be a lesson, shouting chorus-turned voices tearing at his eardrums, "go to the clinic and get treated!"
Today is Henning T. 40 years old, he experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD was launched.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoiac psychosis, in addition to being manic-depressive, taking anti-depression medication, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he's married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and deepest doubt, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality
About one percent of people get sick with schizophrenia at least once in their lifetime, in psychiatric clinics it's the second most frequently treated disease.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, the disability cannot usually distinguish the inner and outer world, they are given to a congested state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions or the illusion of persecution.
Awards are particularly widely used to hear voices - the voices that command, comment on or lead the dialogues.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The sufferer is unable to distinguish the important from the unimportant, the brain cannot filter out the interference signals, the consciousness is inundated with impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis of the floodgates opens up a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Chief Medical Officer of the General Psychiatrie Clinic Clinic of the Heidelberg Clinic.
Schizophrenic is at the center of the action, everything is meaningful to him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, becoming, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and tampered with.
Comparisons with reality are usually not possible for them, phantoms are a terrible reality, waking is excluded.
Once in a lifetime, experience hallucination
Other than in a dream, says Fuchss, "remaining but the sensual and spatial structure of the reality one perceives in psychosis, fundamentally preserved."
Delusional ideas and hallucinations are based on reality, the theft of the experience occurs in a real framework.
Scientists are still faced with a riddle as to why exactly our brains are making somersum like this.
Exceptional states can lead in each person to lose their relationship to reality in the short term, says Fuchs.
But not everyone develops into psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determinant factor.
Scientists are based on the fact that the affected people have minimal brain damage.
We believe that at an early stage of development there will be damage to the neuronal maturation of the brain, for example by the viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a puzzle of how the neural system malfunction occurs, which has not been shown in the process for years.
The influences of the surroundings also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the instigator of psychosis if there is a disposition to it.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transfer system.
When our brains are in a preservation
The crazy thing is that the psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, swallow expensive medications, others give money for drugs to get it, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Whether we see delusions as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, last year he interpreted his results in "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (The Westworld in Our Head).
Hallucinations are one of the typical accompanying phenomena of psychoses, but also to surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline personality or depression, also often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma.
Surprisingly hallucinates under certain conditions the brain of a healthy person himself.
Hallucinations, according to Casten, consist of content of ideas that are normally suppressed.
They arise when parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or not repressed; if our brains are inervor or when the stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the withdrawal of the stimulus, the stress, the worries of love or other exceptional states.
In more recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported that they had been halluculously at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, he lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and goes to the local grammar school.
A perfectly normal girl, actually.
If there weren't those patterns and the voices.
At the breaks, she can be approached by a colock with long, dark hair.
When he answers, the classmates look at it with surprise - no one sees or hears this boy except her.
This shy girl regards the uptight dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't eat, she knows.
He's awake, hears and sees the boy, just as he can hear and see the girl sitting next to him in the pee.
He may even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It feels good to feel, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, he asks.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the appearances are rather dismal
Often, delusions are a burden.
When he sits in the classroom, he can't often watch the lessons, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just representing a new classmate, but he explains to all the others audibly and visibly on the math equation board.
At night, the appearances are rather disheartening.
When he waits in her dark room for sleep, which comes in rarely and too late, he often cannot distinguish whether he is awake or asleep, whether the images he sees, the grimaces, or a girl with bleeding cuts on her hands and feet, is made before her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, yelling at the characters.
She doesn't tell her parents and friends about it, they'd think she'd gone crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She graduated last year and is living with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since contacting psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she has known exactly that she has not gone mad.
Ploughs are also an art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or taken away by the stimuli, they will very likely have hallucinations, says Kasten.
I believe that the brain does not have enough jobs and takes care of its own fun.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of the other children as a little girl, often playing for herself.
Her halting began when she learned at 13 that the man her dad had been calling since the days she thought were not her own father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that also process real perceptions and sounds, it is hard for the disabled as Sarah K. to distinguish delusions and reality from each other. "Each experience," says Kasten, "it takes place in the brain, reality is also displayed there.
Hallucinations are also images that let the brain create, which is why it feels so real."
Night dreams are also evaluated by Kasten as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not distinguished as a matter of principle from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Compared to schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
K Casten therefore advises its patients to assess hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our world too much to be aware, the imaginary experience is mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and chief medical officer at the Florence-Nightingale Hospital Psychiatric and Psychotherapy Clinic in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, oppressive illness, but it also brings positives, creativity - a mirage is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard explored the so-called one-parisconteic form of experience, a strange form of altered consciousness to a dream.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictitious dreams that the offengine of the person considered to be real and cannot even distinguish them retrospectively from the waking state.
The oneirogue state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, such as polyradiular inflammation, who experience motor paralysis in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and one's own, perhaps persistent, with complete inability to move, it replaces the life-threatening real situations of their own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
Type of borderline state between the dream and hallucinations.
As it is not possible to manage a situation in reality, there will be a change of worlds, but the real situation will be made more visible.
An intense form of support for the senses and the transfer of the sensals in some excruciating situation that allows us people to move into loss of consciousness in an instant.
Everything is real, even later in the memories
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his one-irogue experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (Heart Exchange) as a soul rescue.
He was 49 years old when his hearth was operated on a delay in his consciousness on a several-day journey after a heart valve transplant, with his body lying motionless in the intensive care unit.
Claussen immersed himself in the world he had created, visited foreign times and places: He becomes an old man bedridden with a bed, in a train sanatorium, the robot guards his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among a nobleman who makes intoxicating substances out of the blood.
On his motorcycle, he is kidnapped by the Greek to his homeland, surfs in a hospital bed at a company in the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
They plummer completely into an imaginary action, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These inner paths are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
The dream is a different state, describing its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of those mental journeys are clear after years and in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intense, even more clearly, than a real experience.
The intensity of this experience shatters the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, they show one-iroxic states, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug intoxication, how fragile our inner images of external reality are even in the waking state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Casten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
A fact that can also be enriching.
Snow may come
Burda
In 27 to be taken over by publishers by children
The new manager at Kallen is a transitional solution: For a long time, Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
Holding is also to be owned by a family 100 percent in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda has long seen his business in the hands of his children.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and have a firm will to enter the business, says the 69-year-old SPIEGEL.
We handled the details carefully for this.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is asked afterwards.
The question of whether they have the skills to do so.
It is not possible to put their children at the top of the 7,500 employees if they are not sufficiently capable.
That would kill both the kids and the business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he was withdrawing from the chairmanship of the board of directors from January, appointing Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
Kallen, a 52-year-old member, has been a member of the board of directors at Burda since 1999.
First, he was in charge of the technology.
Later, with the Treasury section, the Treasury added responsibility for the company's assets and, after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer, Direct Marketing, Cizin, Tisk and Finance.
For the first time, none of the family members are at the head of the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 today, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen is also used to "fell 10, 15 years," Burda said.
Holding should still belong to a family 100 percent in the future, says Burda.
In light of the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda commented that even the family businesses were not assured before their demise: "This was always the subject of companies that were contracted to be in the desire for capital, which they speculated and thought they could become big players.
It was never my strategy.
He never had "sons of world power," Burda says.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country like Springer, and I don't want to play in the world league with "Time," these deals are too big.

Escotes variados
Christmas is coming, and that's when it's a good time to find out what the celebrities wear and adapt their solemn wardrobe to it.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the character, which must be noted.
We are making several proposals.
Singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut. Not recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona, with an electric car
The Energy Company Endesa, together with the Barcelona City Council, founded the 'Office LIVE'.
It is a project for the development and promotion of an electric car in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE's office (Logistics on the deployment of electric cars) will set out and manage the Roadmap for the deployment of electric cars in the city and provide for mobility agreements, to process, coordinate and submit posters, etc.
It will also develop the projectMOVELE, promote electric cars, collect views and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the purpose is to promote this means of transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the project of introducing electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will also join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government as part of the IOCUMMORE Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
Energy company Endesa has already signed a framework contract with the Catalan government.
The purpose is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan Autonomous Community.
This includes energy-related activities and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative with Endesa's participation in promoting electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively implements a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero anticipates's a time of rest' with the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero foresees that the Spanish automotive industry, the state's main export sector, is in for a quiet time."
In the Prime Minister's economic report for 2009, Zapatero summarised the measures that were put in place during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Competitive Plan for the Automotive Sector, we would face a state of abandonment today, the closure of some of our main manufacturing businesses," the Prime Minister noted.
"Thanks to this plan and the wish of individual brands to continue to operate in this highly competitive sector in Spain, a period of peace with this industry is foreseen in the future, which is our main export sector", he added.
In that sense, he noted that the competing plan, which forms part of the Integrary Plan of the Automotive Sector (PIA), has identified 800 million for projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary firms that mobilised the investment of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment was intended for the development of new models, for the modernisation of the production and existing processes.
Zaprovo also stressed the government's measures to support the demand and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is being applied in cooperation with autonomous areas and car brands.
According to the president, the plan allowed the average emission level for new vehicles to be sold on the Spanish market to be reduced by 6%, and ensured a "significant increase" in the minutes, namely by "40 percent" in November.
20.000 square metres of classic vehicles
The first International Motor Vehicle Salon will be opened in Madrid, a space for a meeting of professionals and amateurs from the world of engines.
This initiative will take place on 5. - 7. February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of Madrid, the Casa de Campo.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres, on which more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but also in ClassicAuto Madrid there will be products of all kinds related to the world of engines.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic motors, a real delicacy for collectors and a curious.
Among the companies involved will be the following:Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and renewal; or Cochera Clásicos, a specialist Mercedes Benz.
Effight tests in the exterior
In addition, the commercial activities of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: camping, sports performances, rehearsals of suitability, presentations and auditions.
There will also be tests on the toll of classic cars and motorcycles in a adapted circuit outside the exhibition zone.
Mazda3 i-Stop: maintaining sporty style
Mazda intends to show that environmental friendliness has no negative effect on the sporting style.
And that's also why the Mazda3 has a built-in engine stop and start-up system - also baptized asi-Stop, a device that is currently only available with a 2.01 150 horsepower petrol engine.
This second generationMazda3 is characterised by the good characteristics it has achieved as a whole.
Surface finishing, design of the vehicle, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, system i-Stop...
All of these aspects are excellent at the Mazda3.
The front seats, incl. the driver's seat, have excellent ergonomics and are superbly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely subtle.
Using a toolkit and console, we conclude that Mazda continues in Japan's tendency to develop futuristic design with many buttons and controls and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style reminds us in part of the style that is also presented by the Honda Civic.
So we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the soberness of German products and, specifically, even more so with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product is more than enough for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, the large luggage compartment and the regular shapes should be mentioned.
The automatic engine stop and start-up system is only available with a petrol engine for two litres and 150 horsepower and a six-speed hand gearbox.
This engine is a real delicacy. It is very tender, characterised by a low level of noise, in performance and lower consumption.
Although the most desirable Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not travel that many miles per year should rule out this i-Stop with a petrol engine, as it is characterized by greater ride-enabled comfort and reduced consumption.
As for the equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
For serial equipment, it is worth mentioning, in particular, the lane-tracking system (RVM), which prevents the creation of a blind angle, stroke and stability control, speed control, an indoor light-sensitive mirror, a large-screen on-screen on-board computer, a parking sensor, a separate air conditioning sensor, a raid and bluetooth audio and wheels from a 17-inch alloy.
And if the equipment was not sufficient, this version was equipped with the Pack Premium, at an additional cost of €1,500: the adaptable two-xenon light and the BOSE audio system with CD holder, among other components.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars of its category.
It is mainly characterised by the quality of the materials used, its operation and the high level of equipment.
Plus, people who don't drive a larger number of kilometres a year can choose this i-Stop version, which is only with a petrol engine2.0 and 150 horsepower.
The only drawback of this model is its higher price, which is €21,770 for the Luxury version and €23,270 for the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price, the Mazda3 offers us a great deal of satisfaction for each day.
The luxurious 'Premiera'

FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, used only to view the mail, without being able to view a certain type of attachments or surf the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the US when Time magazine praised him as one of the products of the year.
It's harder to see it out there, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterised by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount paid for, for example, the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began to offer two new devices: one for Twitter, the other on the basis of permanently provided free data services, but for which it is necessary to pay a six-fold amount for Peek.
FonPeek, which was presented at the Le Web event yesterday, is the European version of the invention and its third transformation.
It is capped as much as his American counterpart, but he comes with surprises.
The monthly maintenance price is around €12 per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People travelling on a smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the border or impatiently in search of a coffee shop with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to view the mail.
The idea with rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, you'd need a doctorate in physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly calling for the roaming tariffs to be accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is a reasonable fear of using data services outside the home state.
The fact that a device like FonPeek (it is interesting that it continues to be called the Fon when it doesn't have WiFi) will reach this type of tariff, means that operators are starting to think differently and are considering different offers to compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering book downloads and other internet searches.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and payable when purchased, not months later.
And that is exactly what I expect to happen in the case of the FonPeek, it is the possibility of buying with a permanent approach as Peek has already been introduced in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm checking the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect this, because I think it is the best type in terms of the consumer.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used in a computer.
Color that Michelle adores
Yellow is undoubtedly the popular colour of the US First Lady.
To take Barack Obama as US President, she chose a dress and a coat in this color, the same color she also chose to do so as she accompanied him at the second most important moment of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being a similar color - yellow-green with glittering effects-, both of which were a three-piece ensemble - a dress, a jacket, and a coat of the same fabric - decorated with a large embroidery or collar.
At first glance, it seemed that the US First Lady had decided to follow in the footsteps of the Asturian princess and wear similar outfits.
The substance from which the clothing is made is made by the two models in a very different way.
On the occasion of her taking up her post, Michelle used a great deal of lace, in Oslo, velvet printed.
It also changes accessories: green shoes with a medium-high paddling, now a model-like model, but in gold.
He also has various hairstyles: this time a jerk, the hair previously melted.
75% of working mothers have work problems related to motherhood.
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for younger-age women who intend to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'Frequency and Career Career for Professionals of Spanish Women', carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The study involved 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75, and the results are clear: 75% of mothers working have limited opportunities in the work market for maternity reasons.
The study highlights that at the start of a cohabitation, there are many differences of opinion about the number of children, depending on whether they work or not, and also according to the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, start living with a partner earlier, first a child early and overall have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, partnering cohabitation and motherhood, are putting off their postponement, and have fewer offspring.
"Women from 35 to 49, with stable employment, have their first child on average 3.7 years since their cohabitation with a partner. This figure is 4.1 for women who have devoted a greater part of their lives to achieve their stable employment and have therefore had to postpone the partnership and the arrival of the children.
The type of profession also has a strong influence on motherhood, although less of a minor influence on the time of initiation of cohabitation with a partner", explains Margarita Delgado, who is researching at CSIC.
Another factor influencing the age of women at the time of marriage and marriage is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age of women getting married and having their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35 to 49 age group, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child, aged 25.1 or. 32,1.
"There is another difference between women, depending on their degree of education.
Women with primary education marry and give birth to their first child before they find a stable job, while women with secondary or high education proceed the opposite of preferring to obtain a stable job, to marry and to the birth of their first child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of female leaders: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal slogan 'Because I'm worth it'.
The representative of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses of the international level, thus joins other famous personalities of L'Oréal Paris as e.g. Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
Before her, actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Fraiture') and Freida Pinto ('Millionaire of the Hut') entered this selected club.
The men's part of this cosmetics brand is also represented by prominent personalities:Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelin's partner in 'Lost').
Prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in fashion matters.
Their most important leaders - designers and models, both earlier and present-a- they met at the annual awards ceremony in London, the Royal Court of the Element of Justice.
There was no shortage of meetings.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of the year.
Manuel Vicente's Poker
Manuel Vicent is donating in 'Esový poker' (Alfaguara, illustration by Fernando Vicente) of thirty X-rays of writers he met in his literary life (and, in some cases, in everyday life).
He does not do so in the feared and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but seeks something similar to the core of a creative personality.
The journey brings excitement, and Vicent spares no disrespect or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reader's perk, even with repeated reading.
Here I cite some of the observations.
On Albert Camus: "I found out on the pages of this book that the Mediterranean is not the sea, but a spiritual impetus, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be named: the forage of the anti-osudud, the guilt-free morality, and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "The hilist, the allegorical Christian, he wrote according to his own nature and not the intellect, something between helplessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humor, with no sense, as if it were the blade of a knife that almost killed him."
On Graham Green: "Our man has been laid for a passion for this woman for thirteen years, an assurs, analogy, and remorse, which is the spiritual privilege of achieving heaven by the way of damnation."
On James Joyce: "This was published by the Odyssey in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the eight-thousand-strong peaks in the universal literature that must be surpassed from the north side, often from which the best climbers come crashing.'
On William Faulkner: "He was a strange person.
Of himself, he said of himself that he was the heir of a landowner from the county, at other times that he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
Both times, these were great dreams.'
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer captured the maddened scream of this man from Munich on the bridge to bring his echo to the night of the XXth century in his literary form, fleeing from himself and calling for the future and speaking sharply to the worms."
On Dorothy Parker: "She knelt and said, "Oh, my beloved,God,for me to stop writing as a woman."
On Joseph Conrade: "In his grave were engraved with Spenser's verse: 'After the effort comes a dream,/ after the storm a quiet harbour,/after the war rest,/after a full life of death."
On Virginia Wolf: "He also carried his depression in his luggage.
The husband had agreed with the fact that she would tell him that Edwardard VII had been following her between the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
Never before has any man been so patient and in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent goes hand in hand with foolishness.'
On Pío Baroja: "What was it about Martín Santosov other than to target Joyce at Baroja?
What was it for Benet to do but have Faulkner's gun execute Baroja?
What was it about Celo but to be made famous at the expense of the man's glory?"
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood, in the district of Fuenlabrada County, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 walked past and our dog, a hybrid saved from a shelter weighing no more than six kilograms, kicked twice and severely injured without a word.
Our indignation is all the greater because we see nothing amusing in such an aggression against a small and defenseless animal that was also on a leash.
On top of that, the old lady's shock after this incident, when she met these individuals on a walk, began to worry about her own safety, too, for such a devil-obsessed man who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man, or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, Tuesday, in the usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day.
Of course, we have lodged a complaint against the nearest police station, but we doubt that it was of any use, and in order not to raise delicate questions, we note that these cowardly murderers were of Spanish nationality.
The outrage prompted us to make that fact known.
We don't understand what's going on with today's youth when they're having fun with the fact that they're tormenting a defenseless animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not understand where the proper manners, respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for using the helm
Tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to promote the use of the helm, mainly for younger motorists, as both of them reported today.
The purpose of this initiative is to highlight the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only means by which to prevent head injuries or, as the case of accident, when riding a motorcycle is accident.
Michelin states that this campaign forms part of their transport safety commitments, which "intends to design and produce even safer products" and confirmed that it is trying to fulfil this purpose in other ways, in the form of a instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of a helmet while riding a motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be to be', is the first stage when up to more than 500 motorcycle repairs will be placed in order to bring it to the attention of the widest public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that the transport safety "is a constant problem" for this company, which is a manufacturer of two-wheeled tyres and whose main objective is to continuously improve product safety.
Increasing sales of light commercial vehicles
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to recover.
All 9.425 vehicles registered in Spain in November meant an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, what is more, this is the first increase after 22 months of sustained bankruptcy, according to figures in the patronising organisation of manufacturers Anfac and sellers.
However, a favourable figure is better to quarantine, as November 2008 is a very poor period for comparisons and marked a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, the increase over the last month, the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling into the category of light commercial vehicles: car derivatives, pick uppes, supplements, smaller trucks and light trucks/riotes.
Nor have the gloom that most damaging demand, even if it was bought by private individuals, most of the purchases were made by smaller and medium-sized firms, and in almost 100% of the time, it is funding through third parties.
To the limitations resulting from the closure of the bank loan source, other factors such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of the poor economic situation should be added.
In the situation, unlike passenger cars, the purchase support for the 2000E purchase did little to help.
In addition to private individuals, it is worth mentioning the businesses of the small and medium-sized companies business license, who intend to purchase a light utility vehicle up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, Ganvam recalled the need to pay particular attention to the management of these vehicles, as well as industrial cars (transports and buses).
The vendor's association is expected to see the development in 2010 similar to the one last year, and according to calculations, sales for passenger cars and 4x4 will fall by 19%.
The manual brake auxiliary system is already a mandatory equipment.
As with the anti-blocking ABS anti-blocking system, this will be the ESP's stability control, the helpers of the handbrake, all of which will become mandatory equipment for European cars.
In fact, it already forms part of the mandatory equipment for all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for others the deadline for the disposal of the shortage is set, which is February 2011.
The measures put in place in the EU are aimed at increasing the protection of pedestrians, while working so that it can help to prevent many collisions.
The manual brake support system increases the pressure on the brakes in the emergency case, which the system detects after the driver steps down.
But it can't always maintain that pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by car parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of drivers who have an accident have not hitting the brake before the collision, and half of them have not fully exploited the brake strength.
Up to 1.100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires the maximum from the braking system, reducing the vehicle's braking distance.
According to a study conducted in the EU itself, if all vehicles were fitted with this type of equipment, up to 1,100 fatal accidents a year related to pedestrians could be avoided.
Reducing this number will be even more noticeable-decent calculations would avoid one of the four accidents with an impact on the person-after introduction of so-called smart hand brake systems.
In this case, the vehicles will be equipped with a system that (using the radar or the camera) will catch the obstacles and are reported by the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver responds, it will help him increase the pressure on the pedal if needed.
If the driver does not respond, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the device will act as intensively as possible on the brake and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, Opel employees of Figueruelas (Zaragoza), that the production of the new Merivo will start in the first week of April - probably 8 April- as reported by Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer points out that it will need more time to meet the Opel recovery plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to get every point of the plan to be first agreed with the party involved.
As a result, it may be that the final document, which will first be submitted to the staff and then to the governments of the countries in which the production plants are based, will be issued with a delay in early 2010.
GM, on the other hand, assures that the Saab sale decision should be taken in these days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the US producers to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM enables contacts with some of the new potential buyers.
One could be Geely, who also wishes to acquire Volvo, but is considering the possibility of Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which operates under the auspices of the Russian group Converg.
In the absence of any of them being able to reach an agreement, GM could sell some of the assets of Saab to the Chinese Baic.
It is still determined to close the Saab at the end of the year if its sale fails.
Ride with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In developing this splendid model, Porsche engineers used the Boxster S as a base to reduce the weight by 80 kg, so the weight is only 1.275 kg.
Based on, in the first place, the automatic retractable roof was in a canvas with a hand-control, reducing the weight by 21 kg; furthermore, aluminium doors such as such as. GT3, which means an additional 15 kg less; removal of air conditioning, 13; the reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to a reduction in the weight of another 7 kg; after mounting the sports seats, an additional 12 kg, thanks to a lightweight 19-inch wheels of five kilos.
Finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less, and replacing the door handles with textile handles means another kilogram.
Also offered with a dual-clutch PDK gearbox, one vehicle with a manually ranked six-speed speed box was tested, mainly on second-class roads in California, on mountain sections with many concocted bends.
His conduct can only be qualified as untouchable.
The reduction in weight does not mean that the vehicle is not to be pressed against the asphalt.
More the opposite: we haven't tested such a small and lightweight model in a long time, which would also transmit such safety as it moves around the bend, even at high speeds.
He's a little athlete capable of warming his muscles on a short drive for the requisite time until he's got a sprint, braking, and a resumption of engine usage...
Anything we want. The steering, which is as communicative as accurate, whatever we hint with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car does.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound as you will
The V6 boxer sound, 320 horsepower (up 10 more than the Boxster S) is very subdued and can be amplified by the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that has previously been used with the Panamera.
The capacity of the acceleration is brutal, whether in the suction or recuperation.
The curtains are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The tarmac of the roads through which we drive through the Boxster Spyder was rather damaged, but the car handled the potholes well.
The electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; and in some corners we came across the frost and gravel even in the advanced morning at dawn.
Ultimately, this ultralight car is one of the most funniest on the market, as it is a little more than a mere modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be put on sale in February 2010 at a price of €70.831.
'Bag Girl'
Karl Lagerfeld's girlfriend, the Coco Cocoon series icon and the occasional 'starlette' at the 'commits' shows, the singer is showing off her face to the evil girl as vehemently as her Chanel handbags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Basconia wins in Israel
The work coffin won a brilliant 82-91 victory in her guest appearance on the complicated Maccabi Electra, despite numerous absences from the Dusk Ivanovice squad, and thus came to the top of her group after a major performance by Mirzy Teletovic, who with eight triple points was the decree of the best in the squad (29).
The Vitoria squad was able to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas, or Mic's great deal of commitment and collective work, although it had to suffer until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great accuracy of the circuit with 16 triple points participated a lot in the final triumph.
The match started with a forehead for the blue, who had been on the mark from the start.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance indicated that they had attacked the Israeli squad very harshly.
English and Teletovic were among the leading scorers 18-20 at the end of the first period.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alava squad opted for the internal play of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by whistling and applause in his return to his original site to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to be the best in his team with 13 points, although'without the six of the Split's review already suggested that it would not be the best night for the Brazilians.
But despite the match being sharp until the break, the decision was not made in the slightest, and the Maccabejjští wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone on their pitch was winning, and 'the 'hand of Elías's hand'and done the win.
Eidson and Pnini have certainly contributed to the 'yellow' back in the spotlight (50-49).
More inappropriate
Members of Ivanovic, injured but not dead at all, needed several precision games to pick up their breath, and then the Mirza Teletovic machine gun appeared, returning the score to the soothing number (54-67) with the help of Englis and Ribas, which the locals reached at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alaws had cut their skin in the last part, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) had already announced that they would not be allowed to be deprived of their deserved results for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this and with Split out of the way, the rebounders were not rushed to the foul and defended well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match was already the winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in a season.
Injuries make Unicica's fight impossible
Unicaja lost significantly to Olympiacos in Greece, leaving him the Euroleague lead to Group B in a match marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but above all by the indoor game(Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga squad did not flinch to the environment of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship, or its opponent, perhaps one of the sick ones in Europe, and with a large budget.
The first-quarter game allowed the Andalusans to dream. Aggressive defense and three triple points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubio, lit up the pitch with a 12-18 minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja , although the arsenal of the locals in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score to 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between the backers of USABeverley and Williams meant the elimination of both players.
The Greek squad began to function and proved its superiority in both zones, where the absence of an English pivot due to injuries to Joel Freeland's injury and two personal errors by Carlos Jiménez put a strain on Unicaja
Between the inner players and the Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas with triple points, they increased the advantage to 44-32 and the 19-minute.
Immense remoteties
The third part was very attacking by the Olympiacos, who, despite losing by 19, showed the upper hand and even managed to match the gap from the match in Malaga Málaga 66-48 minutes to shake the lead in the group.
Unicaja struggled to overcome the absence and last absence of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last game.
Despite all the drawbacks, Unicaja's lead and triple points, Cook and the benefits of Lewis left some hope for a 66-57 win.
But it was virtually impossible, because Olympiacos, by boosting and predominating in the centimeter in its zone, proved that it was unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to equalise the 81-day average-62, the minute, and Unicaja wilted and handed the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you collect for your profile on the Facebook?
Facebook users can get acquainted with the salary they deserve for their profile, thanks to the new Trovit app, the search engine with the largest number of sorted advertisements in the real estate, job and motor vehicles in Spain.
How much should you take? calculates users' salaries based on more than 140. 000 job offers to be held by Trovit in Spain by using a form that is available on Facebook, where you need to insert the profession, years of experience, age and the city where the candidate wishes to work.
During the week of the app's operation, the search engine found that the Spanish worker generally "feels poorly rewarded," Albert Rivera, responsible for the Trovit product, explained in his report.
According to the data available to Trovit from his search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
The British programmer takes €45,226 gross a year and the French one 31.059, while the Spaniard receives 24,000.
Similarly, the driver has a salary of €34,247 net per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16.420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest-paid job of a waiter in Spain is the lowest paid work with €11,592 net per year; followed by a salesman with 14.725 euros and a worker with 15.667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are the driver, the half-time job and the social worker.
Brazil set a date for Zelay's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelay to remain at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic mission no later than January 27, 2010, when his mandate officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, the chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to the TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy by that date, where he has been hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that he must leave on 27 January after the end of his mandate, seek a different refuge."
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the election on November 29 (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week he attempted to take refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually failed because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum, which the government was trying to impose on him by the government "de facto" presided over by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you
After the days of wine and rosehips since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevalent mood of the markets, uncertainty has reappeared in the markets, which should not be surprising, as it is already a natural state in an environment where agents take decisions about a future that is in itself uncertain.
The drug used by the central banks to stabilise the market was the realisation of debt by the direct purchase of assets and the indirect release of liquidity at a close zero rate so that financial institutions could purchase assets to a deduction.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have virtually ended, and without challenging their mismatched liquidity policy, they are beginning to throw some sand in the gears, as the Spanish Central Bank did last year with its auction.
Investors are therefore doubting the world economy's ability to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are taking part in the return of reducing risky returns.
The exchange's immobility and the differences in the company's bonds have recaptured points, though they are still at the far and far from the abnormal level they reached at the start of the year.
The states were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected public debt.
Once again, quality is being pushed, and the US, Japan and Germany have become a haven for the chosen investors, expanding the differentiation of eurozone countries towards Germany.
Spain was almost unaffected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came along and threatened to revise the Kingdom of Spain's qualifications.
On the other hand, some insecurity is not unhelpful for silencing moral hazard advocates who have once again sought to burden the consciences of those responsible for the world's economic policy for hitting the devastating consequences of limiting credit to employment, when in fact a new Thanksgiving Day would need to be announced.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a tribal struggle between the emims of restoring power in the Emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that hides the deficit, the election and the new government is taking over.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for the Ecofin to bail Hungary against non-performance of foreign payments at the start of the year and to allow the euro member country not to meet its commitments.
But what makes sense is for Ecofin to force the Greek government to be transparent and committed to jointly accountable by its own citizens, with the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we find ourselves ahead of the period of normalisation of the interim risk premium, after some excesses in the supported positions they would be in anticipation.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase in the same way as the bonds of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If Europe's differences are reduced and ours are further expanded, it would be a typically Spanish risk.
The matter of Standard & Poor's is just an anecdote. When our leading indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their scenario of the rise to 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not relish much hope for the Spanish economy to live up to this warning.
Again, it looks like it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now "cautiously, my friend drivers."

Iberdell President Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene yesterday in front of the subcommires of the House of Commons, where, as these days, he is discussing Spain's energy strategy in the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by the appearance of President Gas Natural-Fenos, Rafael Villaseca, Galán made some notes to the press about the proposal he had made to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of €50,000 million by 2020 and another €60,000 million from that date by 2030 if the nuclear power plants currently in operation are maintained.
Should this not happen, the necessary investments will not be up to 60,000 million, but as much as 95,000 million.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade, investments must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on grids and international interconnections
From 2020, the issue has changed and performance will need to be increased.
Its range is focused on gasworks and coal-fired power plants with mechanisms to capture carbon dioxide and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, he believes that a new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other "compulsory energies."
Galán, who believes that the women's draft Sustainable Economy Act, which was just approved by the government, corresponds to the line the business demanded, did not want to bleed as a royal decree to support the consumption of national coal, which contravenes the policy of combating climate change.
In his view, the "clear long-term bet" in this sense is a "pretty" measure, as President Iberdrola called them.
Be that as it may be, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must be taken into account now because they are being matured and a stable tax framework is needed to start them.
Ferrovial wins 'handling' Aer Lingus at 10 airports
Ferrovial's subsidiary for airport ground services, the Swiss company Swissport, will play the role of the preferential partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cost services at the 10 European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, which has not yet resulted in economic deadlines, has been in force for five years.
Ferrovial, the Junta Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares, yesterday signed a cooperation protocol to create a Centre for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures
The association projects an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% is Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to research energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona seeks first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession on the motorway in Australia, a market where it already works as an energy and water business.
The building in question is a tunnel estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (about €1,047 million).
Its rivals are the French business of Bouygues and Germany's Hochtief.
A 5-kilometre-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the East Coast has become the closest option for the Acciona to settle in that country as a construction and concession motorway venture.
City Hall wishes to have the tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After selecting public-private cooperation (PPP according to the initial in English) for further development of the project in the business plan sponsored by Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the implementation of the construction and operation of tolls.
The bids are expected to be submitted in the month of May, and the projected investment will reach 1,700 million Australian dollars (EUR 1.047 million) and, in the last phase of the competition, three concerns with a significant presence in European construction.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest construction companies and the second is based in Italy one of the largest European underground construction specialists.
Against the Acciona Group, the Northern Direct Group, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues, are in play.
The third and last concern to pass through the net is LBRJV and is involved in the Australian capital of Leighton (a subsidiary of the construction company of the German construction company Hochtief, represented here by ACS), also a local Baulderstone (ownership of the German Bilfinger Berger group) and a major firm specialising in the civil construction of Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major construction and privatisation, but entails a clear entry difficulty in a way other than the environment of acquiring a local construction company.
The strategy followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger is still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector, in addition to the Asian references.
ACS acquired a market position through its 30 % stake in Hochtief, the owner of the quoted Leighton.
Million Million Amounts
Acciona is betting on a geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its energy supplier's business and in the desalination trade.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and heads a group of businesses that build and manage the desalination facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and to use the common energy to enter the areas of construction and operation of infrastructures.
The underground road subject to toll, which is the Prospire Office for the Infrastructure of the City of Brisbane, called the Northern Link (North Link), is to connect the western motorway from Toowong with the Circle Route in Kelvin Grove (see map) for the length of the tunnel. It is the biggest event to reduce Brisbane's congestion.
The calendar set by the local administration plans to award for the summer of 2010 and the start of work for December next year.
Although this paid transit would open in the last months of 2014, the full completion of the work is planned for 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (€308 million) to finance it.
Brisbane has already offered this contract to Hochtief
Australia still makes a significant profit for Hochtief, as it announced yesterday a treaty with the government estimated at 154 million.
The ACS will make the national broadband network infrastructure operational through its local Leighton branch with a fibre fibre cable.
This situation will allow for the internet to access the internet quickly to 400,000 people and provide the work of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the 27-story project to build a 17-story church in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work was yet to begin and Hochtief closed the sale for 1219 million.
In the UK, in Manchester, he and Laing O'Rourke will participate in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be €75 million.
FCC was allocated a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, received the allocation of a 2,1-kilometer tunnel to a motorway in Slovenia worth €64.5 million.
The company received the contract a few days after the work of the expansion of the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunneling.
Work is scheduled to start in 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore wins ad in Renfe

Fine 63 million for France Télécom for braking competition
The regulator's competition authority in France has fined lFrance Télécom 63 million for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to the institution, the operator restricted competition from fixed and mobile telephones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and fidelity programmes with consumers on the margins of regulation.
With this penalty, the former French monopoly and still the state-owned company has piled up more than €560 million in fines since 1994 for imposing obstacles to its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the authority overseeing the competition considers that France Télécom has committed a similar offence as in the past and that there has therefore been a relapse.
app store
On the other hand, the French company's mobile branch is still a star among other operators and has opened an online app store to increase revenues that will not come from voice broadcasts.
From the start, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries such as Spain.
Playing in the Champions League brought Madrid 476.4 million from the start
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for these clubs since its creation in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have made 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth most profitable clubs in the competition.
The list is led by Manchester United.
The list is led by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not just about glory. It is also one of the main sources of revenue for the big clubs.
As far as the competition has distributed €5,366.5 million of €525 million (of which 12 of them were Spanish), which had participated in the event since the tournament's creation in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The White Club was third on the continent with the most money he received for the participation, and the only one, along with AC Milan, who won the top prize three times.
The Catalan current champion and last winner of the defunct Europe Cup in 1992 is fifth in classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich's Bayern, two teams that also charged the most money to participate in the previous league.
And even though she lost both to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is up to third country, which has received the most money through the Champions, despite having won the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex process of distributing the money used by UEFA.
For this accounting year, the body chaired by Michel Platini is planning to earn 11,090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will donate 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that took part in the preliminary classification round (among other things Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who have reached the participation have received 3.8 million only for their presence, with a further €550,000 for each match in which he participates.
There is also a bonus for the win (€800,000) and a draw (€400,000 for each team). Eight-finalists will receive three million each; eight quarter-finalists3.3 million.
Each of the last four will get 4 million.
The champion earns 9 million, while the second finalist earns 5.2 million.
In this way, the club earns at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed payments.
Barça, on the other hand, won £2.5m for winning the European Supercup in August.
In addition, however, there are variable payments for which 337.8 million are earmarked.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the main ones and has four invited spots.
The champion from last year will receive 40% of the money being added, the second 30%, the third to the third to the third to the third to 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches to be played this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61m for €26.9% Sos
Yesterday, the Nueva Rumasa Group published details of the stock buy offer, with which it wants to gain a top-up from 25% to29.9% of Sos' capital.
This percentage shall not be allowed to make a public bid for the acquisition of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa is offering €1.5025 per share, which it would have paid at the age of ten and for which he would pay interest for this postponement1% per year.
Yesterday, Sos shares ended trading at €1.85; so Nueva Rumasa's offer rated the company 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of €1.50 reflects the real value of the Sos.
The offer is subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the council.
The Jerezská Group provides a period of 15 days for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the shares.
CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, even though Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalisation of the Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos is further changing the structure of his leadership.
As an attempt to remain on the sidelines of possible offers to buy and settle the court-breaking court fluctuations of his former leaders, the Yeshos brothers and Jaime Salazara, the election of María Luza Jordá as head of internal audit was announced.
This decision makes her the first woman to occupy a high-ranking job at a food business.
It is a newly created post that will be subject directly to the president of the group.
And it is not removed from controversy, as the business continues to be immersed in the legal battle over the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from the Sos companies of the Salazar brothers.
De facto, the possibility of Sos unveiling in the coming months to unveil new transfers of funds
As for the Salazars' credit, former board members Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives CCM and Unicaja) testified at the National Court yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV authorises suspension option for the exclusion of the Paternina in Inversora Mer
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) allowed Federica Paternin to be excluded from the exclusion in which the Inversora Mer participates9. October.
The supervisory authority explained that it authorises this operation as it understands that its conditions comply with the applicable standards and considers that the content of the explanatory brochure submitted after the modifications to the introduction on 2 December is "sufficient" content of the explanatory memo.
CNMV stated that the offer was to acquire the 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, which represents 8.95% of the capital of the company, which is made up of 6.142.786 shares recruited to trading on the Madrid and Bilbau stock exchanges.
He further explained that the 5.592,778 million shares had been immobilized and could not be transferred in any way until the tender specified that the price had been set by Federico Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards had been closed.
New tools for car pricing
These days, storms and accidents are being made not only by car service.
Each day, thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance claim are towed to a service where the expert has to estimate the damage and the cost of the repair.
No insured event is the same, and calculating the cost of parts and time of work can be a long and complex job.
Calculating manually the cost of repair from €20,000 to €30,000, including parts and manpower, can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes
That's why almost 100% of the connoisseurs use this kind of system.
Suppliers of services and solutions for estimating claims and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers to then draw up and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the American Solera Group, is a leading firm; 80% of the ratings are made with its products.
Other firms competing in the field of valuation tools and the development of sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, the commercial director of Audatex, they work in Spain with 63 producers and importers, each providing information to them in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data for processing is still growing as more versions, variations and motor solutions have been presented in the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
As soon as a new vehicle enters the market, these businesses will start working.
This is a very frantic job, as it is necessary to catheter each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and set its price.
In addition, for each model, "intelligent" graphic processing" is carried out, where it is possible to "pick" individual parts of the tourist cars.
When it comes to a massive sales model, the job can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
In the case of a minor car, it can take three or four months. At present, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models they have information about are Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
The mobile park in circulation is over 99%.
To do the work of documenting and drafting databases, Audatex has eight centres divided around the world (Spain, France, Germany, the US, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanical practitioners) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests €90 million a year in the drafting of these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data is set up and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this immense stream of information allows businesses to use and provide different products.
The most common uses focus on repair and maintenance, but according to country, there are also tools to manage spare parts or to calculate the car's sales or residual value.
The only undertaking with a guide to informs on the value of the used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer them in our country, but in the United States it does.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get support that can be used by professionals in the sector.
This business offers ten different devices, with the stellar product being AudaPlus, a standard cost valuation solution for connoisseurs.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the time for the repair, estimated by the manufacturer or paint shop.
This tool is applied to each evaluation.
The highest price is €5.75 for customers who use it little, no more than ten times a month.
Then each insurance company that makes thousands of estimates negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow for the complete identification of the vehicle and the devices with which it came out of the assembly line only on the basis of the first chassis number.
