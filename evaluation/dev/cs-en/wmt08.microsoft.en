Inflation in Europe jumps over food
The accelerating inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to the constant rise in food prices.
November price growth in 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, with annual inflation of 3.1 percent registered after 2.6 percent in October, Luxembourg's statistical office said.
The official forecast was only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian banks of issue, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the key interest rate, arguing that such a cut, together with rising raw material prices and falling unemployment, would lead to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to bring the inflation rate below, but close to, two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it has to discourage inflation so that it does not have to do anything about it later.
In Germany, November inflation of 3.3 percent is a fifteen-year record; In Spain, it rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the eurozone has plummeted due to soaring food and energy prices.
Penic forward prices rose by 88 percent, and soybean prices also reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products.
The price of oil on world markets has risen by 52 percent this year, and last month it cost one barrel of black gold nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump to 2.5 percent in 2008 from 2.1 percent this year, but will fall to 1.9 percent in 2009.
According to analysts, the level of 12-month inflation will remain at about 3 percent in the next 3-4 months, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
After a prolonged stagnation, Fidesz's supportive base grew significantly in early December and now has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the Socialists, Gallup has never measured such a low 13 percent support.
In the case of certain voters of the party, the difference due to the greater determination of opposition voters would represent more than two-thirds (71 percent) support compared to one-fifth of MSZP support.
According to the survey, the MDF and SZDSZ are below the threshold for entering parliament: their support among the entire population is two percent.
Among certain voters of the party, there are supporters of both camps one percent more.
Public opinion on the economy has also deteriorated due to the previous low: never has the proportion of those who consider the country's economic situation to be downright very bad at 41 percent, while another 46 percent say the situation is quite bad.
Families are now more pessimistic about the change in their material situation after the spring and summer more hopeful prospects.
As for the next year, the greater part of the population expects further deterioration and only a tenth with gluing.
In December, 71 percent of those polled thought the prime minister was doing his job rather badly and not well.
Ferenc Gyurcsány is trusted or trusted very much by 13 percent of respondents, while Viktor Orbán's supporters are 38 percent.
54 percent do not trust the prime minister at all, 27 percent trust the Fidesz chairman.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be resolved without a change of government.
While after last October's riots, 35 percent considered the government and prime minister to remain desirable, currently this share is only 20 percent, while a relative majority (33 percent) see the solution only in calling new elections.
It is typical for the interest in the referendum that 60 percent of respondents answered the question about their possible participation, that they would definitely join the referendum and another 20 percent said that they would probably join.
By comparison, only 55 percent would definitely take part in this Sunday's parliamentary election, and another 15 percent consider their participation likely. The success of the referendum would be beyond doubt on the basis of the current intentions.
A college fee would say no to 74 percent, doctor's fees 79 percent and hospital stay fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same proportions only among the circle of people certainly promising to participate, then the introduction of tuition fees, doctor's fees and hospital stay fees would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 percent, respectively.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth underrailo Tesco
Hypermarkets in the Budaörs business triangle maintained last year's 16% increase in the price level, on average, with the difference that VAT was not increased this year.
Napi Gazdaság article
The usual Christmas consumption card of the daily Napi Gazdaság in Budaörs' business triangle has grown by an average of 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets the price has increased well over a thousand forints.
Since prices in food supermarkets soared last December, the percentage did not manifest itself due to the previously high base and so drastic increase.
For consumers, it is certainly unfortunate that what they could easily buy last year at a price below nine thousand forints, they will not buy now for ten thousand.
The consumption number of the Day Economy in the hypermarkets examined exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of a koe was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, the consumer car cost 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but very underrails turkey breasts, nuts and also poppy seeds.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we could get a kilogram of bread for 139 forints.
Competitors did not compete with the price of the product below 200 forints.
Similarly, it was surprising in this store that the price of a two-liter Coca Cola in a returnable bottle was below 200 forints, even with the deposit the product cost only 257 forints.
Even so, the bag appeared to be the most expensive this year, according to the consumer daily Napi Gazdaság Auchan, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora raised prices in Napi Gazdaság's consumer koi by 15 percent compared to prices last Christmas, while Tesco and Auchan raised about 18 percent.
When comparing last year's highest and this year's lowest values of consumer koe, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year's lowest and this year's highest is 21 percent.
In forints, the increase averaged 1,480.
The average price increase last year was 1,206 forints, with prices affected by VAT growth last Christmas.
It was this process that disrupted trade, as the supermarkets evidently could not decide how large the price range should be set for individual products, as they could not predict what effect the change in prices would have on consumption.
(If a merchant plans the speed of circulation of a given product incorrectly, he may lose a significant profit because of a price range adapted to the intensity of circulation.)
Due to VAT, the rise in the price of consumer koe last year was so extreme that the price of the most expensive koe was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while the price difference for the cheapest was 844 forints.
This year, there was no such extreme difference, the most expensive ko was now 1,630 forints more than last year and also the cheapest underrail by 1,284 forints.
When comparing the two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic rise in prices emerged, with daily consumption in hypermarkets undercutting daily consumption by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, among other things, does not absolutely confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office: it measured price increases exceeding 30 percent in the case of several basic foodstuffs within 12 months.
In addition to flour, for example, also in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, according to the consumer basket of the Daily Economy, this seems almost impossible, or the price level of the product, which was quite expensive last year, showed a price increase of scarcely more than 10 per cent, even in the worst case.
According to him, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers, and they have also managed to push through a drastic increase in prices in international chains.
Hypermarkets in the business golden triangle do not complain, they still report a good year.
According to our experience, most customers in the three visited stores do not care about prices.
Veho buy quantities, non-perishable food takes after salaries.
On Wednesday morning, long queues at checkouts formed in all three supermarkets, or the number of visitors rose sharply.
However, as we know, there is a turnover in the countryside, several international chains complain to research companies that tractors are lagging behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of non-perishable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are used
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection caused mainly by the inappropriate use of antibiotics were registered in hospitals.
Hygienic conditions of hospitals, overcrowding of beds, overloading of staff do not help to stop infections, according to the head physician of the National Epidemiological Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also being saved.
Recently, the trauma department of St. John's Hospital was diagnosed with MRSA infection.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were discovered in a mue who arrived at the hospital after a serious car accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred in the same place at the beginning of the year.
A patient injured in a car accident was rushed home, but had to return with an MRSA infection not long after, and because of a bacterium in his system, an important operation could not yet be performed.
By December 10 this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multidrug-resistant agents had been reported to the National Nesocomialis Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, head physician of the National Epidemiological Center.
This means that so many infections caused by multidrug-resistant agents have been registered with certainty in hospitals, the rest are unknown.
Nearly two-thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
A third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in their nose without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. throat inflammation, tonsillitis, equine infections, early infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
If the antibiotic bag is given over- or inappropriately, it will develop into a bacterium that responds well to antibiotics, is very resistant to antibiotics and spreads rapidly in inadequate hospital conditions.
Especially in the case of temporary or permanent malfunctioning of the immune system in patients with a weakened organism, low body weight or in patients in years can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, sepsis.
According to the chief physician of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such infections are part of daily practice in hospitals.
Infection is not to be confused with epidemics, MRSA is not only there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where the presence of the causative agent of the disease is not studied.
Resistant to antibiotics
We isolate these patients, the nursing staff treat them in rubber gloves and masks, and we have the necessary antibiotics to treat them, Tibor Nyulasi said.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first examined for the presence of MRSA in their body, but the bag of infection can not always be avoided.
Sampling is not fashionable
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current conditions and conditions in home hospitals are not conducive to preventing the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant agents, says Karolina Böröczová.
Since this infection is typically present in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should check on patients admitted and isolate MRSA carriers.
The collection of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not fashionable.
The fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these examinations also plays a role in this.
Most cases are detected when a patient suffers from a perceptible MRSA infection, said the head physician of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for appropriate antibiotic treatment in the field of human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, medical records.
It is necessary to strive for antibiotic therapy to be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent the development of drug resistance, but hospitals do not comply with this in all cases.
Sampling of microbiological samples is rarely in basic or outpatient treatment of patients, Karolina Böröczová said.
Saves on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA spreads most frequently among patients through healthcare professionals.
Therefore, hand washing and the use of gloves and masks play a very important role, but there are serious shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection and touch, but in home hospitals it is not always possible to isolate infected patients.
On the contrary, the rooms are often overcrowded, the beds are often very close to each other, although from the epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart.
As Karolina Böröczová noted, unfortunately we can also encounter the fact that hospitals that are in an unfavorable material situation, save on disinfectants, there are few caregivers and many patients, which increases the chance of infection.
According to Karolina Böröczová, where the necessary protective measures are observed, there are demonstrably fewer similar infections or the further spread of the causative agent of the disease can be stopped.
Government Program Against MRSA
Treating MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, so it is being combated.
In England, for example, the government has drawn up a program to prevent MRSA, or to reduce its incidence.
The programme seems to be a success, with MRSA infections in England showing a downward trend, according to published data.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) makes the prevention of multi-persistent disease agents (MRSA) and hospital infections caused by these agents a priority.
The police captain, just caused the fatal accident, was not drunk
The official expert opinion in the case of the police captain of District XXII, who only caused a fatal accident, is complete.
It can be ruled out that the police captain of District XXII, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday and who has since resigned from his post, was driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics, Attila Morvai, spokesman for the Prosecutor General's Office of the capital, said on Friday after an expert opinion on the case was completed.
An expert opinion confirmed the result of the initial investigation, which concluded that the former police captain had not previously gotten behind the wheel, had not consumed any alcohol.
On Tuesday, the then director of the XXII Police Directorate in District XXII hit a fifty-five-year-old man who had stepped in front of him while crossing the road outside a marked crosswalk on Lajos Kossutha Street in District XXII.
(The latter fact, that the pedestrian crossed outside the zebra, is not a mitigating circumstance according to traffic rules; the turning car must still give way.)
After being taken to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
Because of these events, the district police chief resigned and asked to be retired, according to the police, because he was so shaken by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain cooperated from the beginning with the prosecutors carrying out the investigation.
An additional €400 million for infrastructure
An agreement on three loan lines worth a total of €400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy was signed on Friday in Budapest by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a framework of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environment projects implemented with the Cohesion Fund support, whereas the parties had previously concluded a loan agreement for EUR 100 million, the contract now signed covers the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
A €150 million loan agreement is also used to finance education-related projects in the budget.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary for this purpose, the remaining EUR 150 million may be used at a later date, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the parties have signed a contract for €50 million, which the budget will mainly use for a research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
The 4th metro line was also discussed at the meeting.
The parties agreed that after Hungary agreed with the EU on the details of the financing of the metro, they would return to whether and how the original contract should be modified.
According to János Veres, this may happen in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary with €8.4 billion since 1990.
The interest on EIB loans granted with a waiting period of eight years and without a commitment commission is linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is an EU real estate haven
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is overwhelming, the attention of the whole of Europe is turning to the previously somewhat neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who buys in the still cheapest, but rapidly expensive EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Bulgaria is now undoubtedly the most sought-after Eastern European property destination, with its cheap ski apartments and seaside houses.
Of the mountains, Bansko, Borovets, Pamprovo and Vitoa are the most trending, while on the sea coast Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Beach, the ancient towns of Sozobol and Nessebar, while more and more people are also looking for properties around Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country will arouse the interest of investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, and more and more buyers are also shopping around the downright cheap city of Ruse.
The capital Sofia also promises attractive opportunities, business and office space promises the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of Europe's most attractive golf paradises, making it a popular travel destination in the other two seasons in addition to the summer and winter seasons.
Foresighted investors buy it in bulk, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are trying to change their lives and lifestyles at the same time.
Most customers come from England, but buyers also come from France, Belgium, Spain and, increasingly, Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present, and there are traditionally many Russian customers on the Black Sea and in ski paradises.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgy Yankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settlers buy either renovated properties worth 50-100 thousand euros, or dilapidated old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which they then renovate.
They require good accessibility and communication options, the proximity of a large city, shops and usually a local doctor is important to them.
The second category is cottage buyers (Bulgaria ranked among the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of rising value in the medium or long term.
The price increase of real estate in the capital is uninterrupted, or the demand is getting stronger.
Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, growing by 21 percent annually over the past five years.
Rising house prices far outweigh wage growth.
Fodor and Hungarian est percent
According to information from the Minister of the Environment and Water Management, Gábor Fodor, the meetings of experts will end on Tuesday and after Wednesday's official opening, the international conference on climate change after 2012 will continue with a meeting of ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap, a solution to the efforts following the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol in force until 2012.
At the moment, there is a heated debate between developing and developed countries about them.
The United States has also announced that it does not wish to negotiate exact figures now, although it is leaning toward an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
Another big question of the conference is whether developed countries will agree to reduce emissions, but also to provide both material and technological assistance to countries that depend on it.
An agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The grant fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member governing board, most likely within the framework of the UN's World Environmental Programme (GEF), according to Piac és Profit.
Hungarian Six Percent
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister of Environment and Water Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to take a leading role in global climate protection efforts and to help bring about a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister said that the EU commits to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, independently of the success of the post-2012 agreement, and is ready to commit to a 30 percent reduction if other developed regions of the world are willing to accept responsibilities and commitments commensurate with their monosts.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 set themselves a reduction target of 5.2 percent, while the then 15 EU Member States committed themselves to 8 percent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87, which our country can meet. is mentioned in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali, or an international agreement on a long-term climate change policy needs to be adopted within two years, otherwise its entry into force would surely be postponed beyond 2012. In that case, the reduction commitments set by the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new system of emission reductions, as the UN international scientific body on climate change IPCC has also pointed out in its latest report, but it is a Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
This would lead to a delay in the reduction of emissions and an inevitable increase in the Earth's average temperature of more than 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists say would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
British military units publish recordings of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan on a video-sharing site, popularizing themselves.
YouTube was first popular with the British Air Force (RAF): special forces operating in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of anti-Taliban operations there since March 2006, the BBC reported.
The recordings, taken by a miniature camera attached to a helmet, are checked by Air Force Command, which controls combat operations in the Kandahar area, and then sent on to London for transmission to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
In this form, 139 recordings of soldiers of the British Air Force got on the Internet and more than 75,000 people watched it on their channel.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as Defence Headquarters in the spring of 2007 and publishes recordings of events in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Force in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Deployment to Afghanistan
The Air Force released the videos as originally intended for recruitment purposes, and according to the Ministry of Defense, they are also good for informing the general public about the real purpose of the army's presence abroad.
Promotion published in this form costs almost nothing compared to traditional television recruitment advertisements, defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, but it necessarily carries a political message or confirms in a special way the legitimacy of the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans made the game
The army is concerned that, in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are also being released on the server, capturing, for example, the death of soldiers: in somewhat hypocritical, official propaganda films, officers talk about casualties, but the bloody form of combat is not shown.
After all, many videos of the fight in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were created during the live deployment, but the British army has come to the Internet, and now.
Americans recruit a little differently using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can get directly into the goat of soldiers through a more or less faithful simulation.
At the ministries there will be Christmas with a raffle and pagáčky
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth is apparently not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a final work meeting for her colleagues, saying goodbye to 2007 with pogs and coffee.
In some ministries there will be a celebration with live music, in others they will conjure up a Christmas atmosphere for officials with a raffle and a toast.
A party, a Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a Vedic table are enjoyed by the powerful.
State authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
The Ministry of Defence will hold the most expensive ministerial Christmas celebration this year, but it does not expect its employees there.
At Christmas for orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, during Missionary Christmas they will host family members of soldiers currently serving on foreign missions, but they will also organize a reception for journalists.
The resort will donate 25 million to the atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) are in the works compared to other ministries.
The GKM party is held in the center of Jövő Háza, for a total of 4,320,000 forints, and out of six hundred employees of the ministry, approximately three hundred and fifty guests are expected.
The resort will celebrate Christmas traditions, but there will also be various performances and a raffle.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Justice (OIT), with concerts and dinners on the agenda.
The rent of the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred invitees.
It seems that one NFÜ department is invited to another Christmas celebration: it will be organized by the tender company, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG), with EU money.
For this purpose, they rented the building of the Vígszínház Theatre.
MAG a.s. did not confirm this information as we could not reach the relevant person.
No suit needed
The OIT building hosted not only the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which instead of Christmas organized the Ball of St. Lucia on December 7.
OIT did not want money from him for the use of its halls.
The ball was attended by five hundred people.
The party began with a greeting from the minister, and after dinner they could dance to the accompaniment of live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo], evening atti or suit were not mandatory at the ball.
A puritan party is being prepared by the ministries of health, labour and local governments.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in their own building.
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth does not even officially invite her co-workers to a Christmas party, but to a final work meeting.
One hundred and eighty guests are counted, who, according to the press office, will only receive coffee and pagáčky, and only 350,000 forints will be enough for the party.
Minister for Local Government Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will have a toast in the auditorium of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas meeting at which 436 workers are expected in its own large hall.
He will donate 2,500 forints per guest for the Christmas party, the total amount includes a reception with Vedic tables and a toast.
Since János Veres has been minister, PM workers have celebrated Christmas in a similar way every year.
The atmosphere of the vak party will be missed, the officialness is intensified not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time of the event.
The Ministry of Agriculture holds a New Year's reception on January 20, there is no ministerial Christmas.
The reception will take place at Vajdahunyadvár Castle in the City Park and, according to the ministry, 1,000 forints per person are designated for one hundred guests.
According to the press office, it will be a very simple reception to which only perihelion foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a brief greeting from the minister and end with a small nudge.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not hold Christmas parties at all, the relevant press departments told [origo].
The price of the Environment Department's Christmas celebrations could not be disclosed to the press department.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to a party held in the Museum of Decorative Arts.
A giant strike is brewing
The League Trade Union Association and the National Union of Workers' Councils (MOSZ) will form a strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday's indefinite strike.
A public protest meeting will be held on Saturday, and work will be halted on Monday on the day of the final vote on the health insurance law.
The action will certainly cause serious disruptions, as rail transport will almost completely stop and employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also be on strike by 1 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, the League and the National Union of Workers' Councils will present details of Monday's jointly organized strike.
A strike committee will also be formed LIGA MOSZ, which will coordinate Monday's action.
On Saturday, a public protest meeting is held, and from Monday, unions joining the strike will stop work indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
This means that no date has been set for the end of the strike, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
Should Parliament ultimately fail to pass the health insurance law, the unions will withdraw the call for a strike.
If the legislation is passed, strike commissions will meet and decide on further action.
According to Monday's agenda of the session of Parliament, it is also possible that the law on health insurance will be voted on and in the late evening or night hours.
Due to the strike starting on Monday, traffic disruptions can be expected: work on the railway will be stopped indefinitely, part of Budapest's public transport may stop in the morning, and more than half of the Volán companies may stop.
At the same time, half of the lane will also be closed in many parts of the country.
Numerous trade unions and civil society organisations have joined the call for the strike, the list of which is constantly updated on the League website.
Some organizations announced a strike for an indefinite period, others declared a temporary halt to work.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MÁV) and the Independent Union of Railway Employees (VDSZSZ) had not even been able to agree on sufficient services, while more and more people are travelling on the railway at the beginning of the Christmas holidays.
According to previous announcements, there will be a strike at BKV from the start of operations until 1 p.m., from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike will be organized by the Energy Workers' Union LIGA, and the Teachers' Union has called for a 2- and 2-8-hour stoppage, respectively.
The Union of Hungarian Doctors will strike alternately across the country, while the Democratic Trade Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ), part of the Cooperation Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), is holding a two-hour strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the League Association is that the government revoke the proposal for health insurance reform and submit a new concept for public debate.
The second requirement is that the new method of counting pensions, effective from next year, be introduced gradually.
The third is to ensure that early retirement for the relevant sectors of employment can be included in the scheme before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Union of Railway Employees (VDSZSZ), part of the League trade union, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning railway branches, and expects a different offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases Country Risk
According to Political Capital's Risk Analysis Division, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért in August this year, have increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
In connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that by exacerbating the already existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Roma population of Hungary, it may in a short time lead to violent ethnic clashes.
The main reason is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably aimed at provoking such an action, the research institute adds.
As he writes, this can be explained by one of the greatest negligence of Hungarian political representatives: public representatives of public life left the public discussion of the Roma issue to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could build a political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian conflict.
This exacerbates the problem, hinders normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard have largely damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of faith in the stability of the country and its democratic maturity, due to the great attention of domestic and foreign media.
As part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and far-right groups, which has received increasing publicity and vehemence since autumn 2006, several self-calling national militia associations have been created in Hungary since the summer of 2007.
The common feature of these groupings is that they define themselves as civic associations, while openly proclaiming the armed readiness of their members to perform defensive tasks (in the event of major disasters, attacks on the homeland, disruption of order), moreover, referring to the incompetence of the police, the army, or the state, he adds.
He goes on to note: this is done in a way that seeks to wrap up various political endeavors built on society's opposition to politics and parties in civilian clothing.
In the case of these groups, emphasizing civility and the form of the association does not only serve to avoid the legal pitfalls of judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a factor increasing the risk in terms of neighbourly relations.
In recent months, they have pointed to the Hungarian Guard in several neighboring states as a potential source of danger, and ultranationalist political leaders of some neighboring countries want to excuse their own anti-Hungarian policies by citing the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
This may affect the political stability of the region, he adds.
According to the research institute, the emergence of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not an isolated phenomenon, and political risks for the region as a whole have also increased.
The activities of the Hungarian Guard are similar to, for example, those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The background to the formation of the Bulgarian Guard is the mass Roma riots that broke out in one of Sofia's neighborhoods (Krasna Polyana).
The BNU used this to establish the Guard, with the goal of the organization being the national militia.
Over the past 17 years, Gypsy terror has occurred in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent.
He adds that the initiative has provoked a stormy discussion among the Bulgarian public.
The increased risk of ethnic clashes is signaled by the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations that they will form their own guard as a sign of resistance.
Since the current activity of the Hungarian Guard shows similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that Hungarian Roma will react to the threat in a similar way, by establishing their own militia, we can read in the risk warning prepared by the Political Capital Institute.
Asked by the press office, Attila Juhász, research director of Political Capital, said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they publish a risk analysis every year, and if they find something that could affect a change in risk, they inform public opinion, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Holidays are not free
In Hungary, days off are precisely laid down by law, and it has become a general practice to move working days around holidays, which will be less common next year.
In the European Union and America, holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and public holidays and non-working days.
Non-working days are usually associated with church holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is a New Year's Day off so that people can relax after New Year's Eve.
During the year we have a total of eleven free holidays.
The national holiday is 15 March, celebrating the Revolution of 1848, and 23 October, the memorial day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20 we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1 we celebrate work, on November 1 and 2 we remember deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, the two-day holidays are Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since national, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend according to the calendar, it has become a practice to move the working day in cases where we work only one day before or after the holiday.
The price for long weekends is, however, that the previous Saturdays we stay hard and in the round.
The day that immediately precedes or follows the holiday has been regulated for many years by the Minister of Labour in a special decree.
The law applies equally to all employers and the workers employed by them, to public employees and to persons in the public service.
It does not apply to companies and institutions that operate without interruption or, with regard to their purpose, operate even on public holidays.
This year, the change in the working rules will take place only around the end-of-year holidays: from 24 December, life in the country will almost stop, or according to past experience, most people work the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve in advance or use the saved holidays in this way.
Next year, several of our holidays fall in the middle, respectively at the end of the week, also the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar is transformed around Labor Day, so that workers can stay home for four days afterwards.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2, can be a day of rest.
Dalí's move is related to the holiday of 23 October: Saturday 18 October will be used instead of Friday 24.
The end of the year next year will be able to take place entirely under the sign of holidays, because from December 24 they will have almost nonstop holidays despite the fact that New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six Removing Little Things to Paint Your Colleagues
Emails we forget to send, voice messages we never receive, innocent messages we barely know: this livens up the days of science for hardworking.
The question is whether you will get used to these minor inconveniences or put on gloves and deliberately avoid unclear situations that may make others angry.
Tips.
Sorry, I forgot to tell you they were looking for you from the marketing department, a colleague tells you.
Did you miss a meeting because of that?
In the best case, he regrets it and tries to fix it, or he calls the marketing department and says that he forgot to pass the message (this is a less common solution).
Most often, the matter is resolved with one apology.
Sooner, not to an embarrassing apology, it is good to think about what you could do to prepare unpleasant moments for your colleagues, and consciously try to prevent it.
Are you borrowing something that is not yours?
There's nothing annoying about reaching for some paper, office supplies, or your phone, and they're not there.
Do you remember that you put a seivac on the table yesterday, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you discover your pen on a colleague's desk that you thought was lost?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without permission, otherwise they will rightly be angry with you for digging in their affairs.
Don't take envelopes or sticky notes from the office, as it can be annoying when you run out of them prematurely and you need them immediately.
Gossip about the private lives of colleagues?
There is no good solution to stop the spreading gossip.
Who, with whom, what did he do?
Where and why?
Do not tell the nose of your reports (assumptions) about the private lives of colleagues!
When one of them shares his innermost secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Lock in what you have heard, and in his absence, do not discuss it with your colleagues, even when others know about his things.
Are you reporting your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and report your absence because you are unwell, or you think that today you would rather rest, think that your work, urgent tasks and work that have a certain deadline will have to be done for you by someone else.
Be considerate of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you won't be going to work the next day, or that something may happen that will make you want to stay home, report it so that your colleagues and leaders are not confronted with your absence the next day.
Humming, giggling, talking on the phone
Have you immersed yourself in work, are you roughly jolted out of it by the giggles of your colleagues?
Did you inadvertently witness a telephone conversation that would have been hard to hear?
Do not disturb your co-workers by humming, singing, talking loudly (over their heads), or stomping, constant swearing, loud dissatisfaction.
This can be rude even when they are not involved in a project (writing, planning, organizing).
Do you blame others for mistakes?
If something is not on time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, don't blame others for your forgetfulness!
Do not refer to the possible chaos reigning in the office and noisy colleagues!
Acknowledge if you made a mistake and someone paid for it, and repair the damage!
Ask how you could put things right, correct negligence!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Sweatpants and slippers: comfortable clothes at home, not suitable for the office!
Do not wear casual clothes, even if your profession allows it!
Do not be careless, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in ordinary clothes and, if your profession requires it, nicely and elegantly!
When a person wants to comply, he ceases to be interesting
Eating in the usual morning traffic jam.
A strange melody comes from the radio: the sound of a violin, to which electronic effects are added.
I add volume.
The music changes tempo and bass is added to the previous tonal timbres, then the En choir joins like a real gem.
The mr2 station features a Zagar song called Wings of Love.
For a long time, domestic music life did not spoil us with quality electronic pop.
Suddenly, the constipation looks quite different, because he is listening to the new Zagar album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, a few new and interesting productions coming from the domestic digital underground slowly changes the overall picture, and although garage rock with its guitar beating is back in vogue, even home electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs and he also played in Yonderboi's band, and in the end, perhaps because two bagpipers did not fit into one čarda, he went his own way.
With his project (Zagar) and music that combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to break through, and when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (eg.
Ferenc Török's film Szezon).
His bands, playing in the beginning in currency clubs, got to know the wider audience after wan2 magazine ranked their first album from 2002 among the fifty most important domestic albums and declared Zagar in the Yonderboie company to be almost the only domestic development-defining entity that could be sold in the West.
Zagar and his band are undoubtedly trending, though of course no one has asked them if they are happy with the label.
The band reacted as it should: they made a new one, they are gluing an album.
The now released album, Cannot Walk Fly Instead, may open up new paths for them, although the title itself tries to create continuity with the early years in Pécs.
It is one verse from a song by an old band by Balázs Zságer.
A reference to the ethereal, flying would be in place, avak next to the ethereal tinge of this music has now appeared in accordance with the spirit, the trend of the time louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
These songs featured singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with The Puzzle, at the premiere of the album in Millenáris Park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Petőfi, playing popular music lately from morning to evening, we began to get stuck with the sweeping melodies of the song Wings of Love, recorded with six domestic singers (Underground Divas).
Also everything in order (?).
The portal interviewed Balázs Zságer hvg.hu.
hvg.hu: In the context of this new hit, the question arises, to what extent does what you play remain marginal music?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of marginal music doesn't mean much to me.
To me, there are two different castes of light music; Not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don't say anything, and they can just as easily be created just to sell what makes it commercial.
But even a good pop song can stem from a sincere inner need.
The attitude as it is accepted, regardless of language and national borders, also works in this spirit.
hvg.hu: Does he see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: Abroad, especially from us to the West, my light music is more traditional.
Not only teenagers and people in their twenties go to concerts there, but also the elderly.
They follow the transformations of light music around them much more, because they also consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who, where and in what numbers listens to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it is a good feeling that more and more people come to our concerts.
But we've never made music for the market.
In our country, music is not born with a goal, but for a reason.
The role of the audience can be perceived sleeping at concerts, where there is a mutual influence, but it is hidden only in the elusive transformations of the okamik.
Still, I thought that when you want to suit the audience, from that moment you stop being interesting.
hvg.hu: To what extent is he going to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works solo and has built his career away from us to the West.
B. Zs.: We don't actually go his way, regardless of the fact that our music sometimes tries to explain it.
We are sleeping team players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first, of course, it was impossible to avoid comparing our work to Yonderboi's songs, but a few of us separated from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the top list of mr2 Petőfi, the song Wings of Love reached the first place.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open up to the Irish classes in a more popular style?
B.Zs.: We didn't plan to write a hit to sell the record.
There's more to that song.
We intended it as the finale of the album, which we tried to release the previous sonic and more complex themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the female singers?
Why is what was the guiding principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel choir.
Then came the idea to assemble this choir from soloists of the domestic music scene with a good voice.
That's how this six-member choir of Sena, Edin Kutzor, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - came together, which we then rechristened Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is that how you intended the song, or did the girls recreate something on it?
B.Zs.: The song existed for a long time in an instrumental version, when the material was then put on the album, we thought that something would be needed for this song.
The sequence of chords tempted to add a singing part.
That night I sang a melody to it that the girls later learned.
The whole thing came out almost the first time and very spontaneously.
I remember how it came alive, but of course it took Wonders.
With my voice, it wouldn't work that vigorously.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, the girls seemed to be in the background.
They don't have a solo (except Judy Jay), they don't have a role of their own, they sing completely together and they are not louder than the music, also the music does not just accompany their singing.
They also stood at the back.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing in the back was only due to technical problems.
On the contrary, the fact that we did not want to divide solo roles is intentional.
Even the song is about forgetting a little bit about our ego, where someone is from, where they belong, and just letting those wings, the wings of love uplift us.
I wished that the euphoric state that we felt when the song was born would be felt by others.
hvg.hu: Which was the most work?
B.Zs.: During the composing of the music actually with not one, the pieces occurred dormant during mixing.
For example, Dorian Grays Dilemma, in which I play the concert grand piano, or RocknRoll Goes To The Girls, where groove did not want to work for a long time, then everything slowly found its place like in a jigsaw puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new album is your favorite?
B.Zs.: That keeps changing with touring and the fact that I dropped the record.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
Treacherous broker risked billions out of inferiority
A treacherous embezzler.
This is how the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the domestic Komerční banka, describes its former employee, Jerome Kerviel.
It lost almost five billion euros because of it.
Rather, it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to match his colleagues and certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all the big banks, he recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market in time.
"He is mentally weaker," said his superiors, who sent police after him.
However, according to Kerviel's testimony, which was reported by French media such as Le Monde, he was a man who at the end of last year had profits of 1.6 billion euros from his deals.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in his testimony.
In the summer, he managed to make half a billion euros from the American crisis.
He sensed an opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to emerge that so-called sub-prime mortgages, given to low-income clients or those who have had repayment problems in the past, will have problems.
But the crisis was not supposed to affect the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and bet correctly.
At the end of the year, its profit climbed to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even when I made my first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he certainly didn't keep anything to himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits that he falsified the records so that he would not be discovered.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though the Eurex exchange became interested in his trades.
Risk was profit
Was he afraid of being discovered?
Not really.
"I thought the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he get the will to risk so much?
He had to gradually work his way up to his position.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, just after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker, and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $ 90 thousand.
Yet he knew he would never earn as much as others.
"I knew from my first interview in 2005 that I was being watched.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel told investigators.
But shortly after the onset came the first great success.
Thanks to the shares Alllianz earned, during the bombings on London bet on the decline of this title half a billion euros.
And that was the trigger - he wanted more.
As long as you earn, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told police.
But apparently the bosses knew, or rather suspected, about everything.
"As long as I was making money, they turned a blind eye."
But then came the blow earlier this year.
He lost a billion euros in a single day.
After a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to smooth it out.
When he came to work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they find it?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
"I've only chosen four days in the past year.
A broker who doesn't have a vacation is a broker who doesn't want anyone to look at his records," Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to get CZK 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech government ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine operational programmes, of which the Czech Republic may receive EUR 14 billion (approximately CZK 365 billion) in the coming years.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately CZK 125 billion will go from seven operational programmes to the regions.
Czech companies will be able to receive around CZK 100 billion from the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
Most of the money, up to 150 billion, will go to transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will manage the amount of CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Companies should obtain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
So far, the Czech Republic has been one of the least successful in drawing money from EU funds among the newly admitted countries.
Twenty-year sentence for ex-president of Nicaragua upheld by court
An appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday upheld a 20-year sentence for the country's former president, Arnold Aleman, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud amounting to $ 100 million (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
He was later released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan capital.
Whether the former head of the Central American state from 1997 to 2002 will return to prison is unclear at this time.
According to the president of the appeals court, Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to prison officials whether to let Alemán serve his sentence at home or go to prison.
Four years ago, a court proved to Alemán that he regularly moved government money into the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious, and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money ended up in a fund that Alemán set up to finance his 2001 election campaign.
So they approved our budget
That's right.
The state budget was adopted.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
It passed for this year last year with the support of the ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the ČSSD could not afford not to accept it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote of no confidence in the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The Chamber of Deputies calmly passed this traditionally overlooked, though most influential, law.
It is a kind of paradox.
Every government begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether one likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the power struggle between the government and the opposition.
It is more newsworthy and therefore receives much more attention in the media.
Politicians' guesses are much more interesting to the public than stark numbers.
State budgets in the previous Social Democratic governments suffered from three ailments that the 2008 one is unable to solve at once:
The first is the high proportion of legally obligatory expenditures, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved last year before the elections by the silent "coalition" of the ČSSD and the KSČM.
The second is deficit management as a result of the malady of the first.
The third limit is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the deficit of the budgets of cities and municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the state budget deficit.
It is public and relatively controlled.
However, the time bomb is the deficit of the budgets of cities and municipalities.
In addition to tax, fees and bank loans, many mayors often recklessly issued bonds to indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have managed to repay these debts by mass-selling shares in energy and other power grids that they received from the state through privatization.
Now they no longer have that source.
If we stick only to official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a growth phase for several years, which ČSSD constantly boasts about.
This was a unique opportunity for its governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, they increasingly indebted the state.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, managed much more sensibly than our republic.
This is a huge disgrace, which falls primarily on past governments.
We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, least at risk of poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, have just unnecessarily swelled to gigantic proportions in recent years.
Even if we managed to abolish some of the absurd populist spending approved before the elections this year, if the retirement threshold and pension reform are not pushed in the near future, then virtually all politics in this country will end, and whoever governs it will be just a bureaucracy.
With a slight exaggeration, it can be said that the ruling politicians will become bureaucrats, mechanically distributing most of the taxed money into pensions and social benefits.
That is why this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only suspend the displacement of normal spending by mandatory spending.
The planned deficit of EUR 70 billion for 2008 would have been completely useless if past governments had not spent the last ten years as much as they could.
If we do not really want the ruling politicians to become mere bureaucrats, then we must be patient and give this not very strong coalition government, which realises that the state can only spend as much as it can get in taxes and fees, peace of mind to prepare further reform laws.
Only these will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
Thus, more than a hundred billion dollars will reach the currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, banks auction the interest rate at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will put forty billion dollars to auction, and another twenty-four will be made available to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the attacks on the eleventh of September that national central banks have agreed on such a coordinated approach to prevent or reduce the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This move is intended to address the economy's biggest problems, which is the growing lack of free capital that banks can lend," Bernard Baumohl of Economic Outlook Group, a consultancy, wrote in a report to clients.
"Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to fifty percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost sixty billion dollars to non-performing loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect billions more losses.
"Central banks must be really worried about what might happen next now that they have decided to do this," said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to credit, they will also lend more expensively to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into recession with potential effects on global economic growth.
Central banks made the decision after failing to cut the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used to lend money in the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still worried about lending money to each other, even though the central banks of the US, Canada and the UK had cut their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as a further decline in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks' move will help stave off the crisis because it does not solve the underlying problem, which is the collapse of the US housing market.
Klaus: Environmentalist debates are unbelievable
Global climate change is supposed to hurt developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus again commented on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now descended on the outgoing UN international climate change conference in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, Not Green Planet, he said the debates among environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference, which consists of a strange mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, is unacceptable, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it's just a firework of words that are a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
When presenting his book, the Czech president emphasized that its topic is very important to him and that is why he is so committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction that the book appeared in German translation because, as he said, "I often only encounter caricatures of my opinions."
So now those interested can read his unbiased attitudes.
Klaus reminded that although he is not a climatologist, he has enough prerequisites to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to follow and judge professional treatises, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book were the theses that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus on the warming of the planet by all scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably expensive.
Moreover, as a person with experience with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous restriction of freedom.
When questioned by those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against militant environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits."
Klaus spoke on the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to exchange their driver's licenses
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and did not manage to exchange their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day for people to apply for an exchange so that the authorities can still issue them a new card by the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid license will take to the road after the New Year.
According to the authorities, the cards have not been exchanged mainly by those who no longer even want to drive.
While municipalities report a sharp decline in interest in exchanging driving licenses, authorities in the capital are overwhelmed with applications and interest in replacing the license has increased this week.
The municipality takes away around 2,000 clients a day.
There is a queue wait of about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driving licenses.
It takes twenty days to issue a new card.
However, it is possible to apply for extradition within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
Motorists who do not manage to change their licence by the end of the year and go on the road without a valid driving licence will face a fine from January.
The offender pays a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, a police officer can also solve the offense by agreement.
In the case of an administrative offense, the fine rises to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, even a person who does not go anywhere could be fined by the town hall.
He reportedly could have paid up to 30,000 crowns.
The ministry has previously called on the authorities to be lenient and impose a fine of no more than one thousand crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, however, there is no threat of tens of thousands of fines.
A driver's license is a document that people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not an identity card that every person must have valid.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driving licence.
Just take it away or send it by registered mail to the relevant municipal office.
At the end of the year, licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid.
However, motorists must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
The licences, which were issued between 2001 and 2004, expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million other documents.
Court reduces sentences of detectives in league with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of criminal association with David Berdych's gang, will go to prison for thirteen and ten years respectively.
This was finally decided by the Prague High Court, which reduced their sentences, one by one year and the other by two years.
Originally, detectives from the Prague Department for Combating Organized Crime were threatened with 14 and 12 years.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's decision, only an appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych is also charged in this case, but he is still waiting for the first-instance verdict.
In other trials, however, he has received sentences totaling more than 16 years.
He can't get more.
In January, the Regional Court found 19 people guilty of participating in robberies, while the High Court today heard appeals from 16 of them.
Most of the accused have rejected the charges since the beginning of the investigation, saying that it is a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police officers, in agreement with Berdych, among other things, passed on information from police sources to criminals, covered up individual robberies and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang gave 30 percent to Opava and Koňařík.
The indictment alleges gang crime from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, the victims of which often suffered serious bodily harm, but also abuse of office and illegal arming.
During house searches, police discovered illegally held pistols, bullets with a steel core, a laser sight and a submachine gun.
According to the accusations, the gang lost tens of millions of crowns through robberies.
In addition to the nearly twenty men in this trial, the courts have already convicted Berdych and a number of other people of other robberies.
Other men close to Berdych are still confessing before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The trial has so far avoided Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic for prosecution.
Child swap bill: 12 million
For the confusion of the children in the maternity hospital, the lawyer of the damaged families, Igor Veleba, wants compensation of CZK 12 million from the Třebíč hospital, plus court costs.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the father, and a million for the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital's legal representative, Ondřej Dostál, therefore fundamentally disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a request, it is very, very high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"But in order to form an opinion about the counterclaim, we need an expert opinion, which the opposing party has commissioned.
We will find out whether it has any informative value at all.
However, we remain of the opinion that it will be in hundreds of thousands for everyone," Dostál emphasized.
According to him, the amount should be between CZK 100,000 and 200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for each month they did not raise their biological daughter.
Veleb was served as a basis for negotiations on compensation by an expert opinion prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motol.
The children's parents, according to experts in the field of psychology and psychiatrists, suffered psychological damage and stress in varying degrees and depths.
The stressful situation was better tolerated by men, although they faced reproaches that they did not prevent the confusion of newborns.
Women, on the other hand, have a harder time coping with the topicality of the experienced trauma and what is happening right now, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses in the Třebíč maternity hospital on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the Governor of the Vysočina Region, Miloš Vystrčil, handed over CZK 100,000 to each of the families to compensate for the expenses they incurred as a result of the mistake of the Třebíč hospital, which the region is establishing.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured against liability for damage by law.
In the event of misconduct, they must reach into the reserve fund, exceptionally they can ask for assistance from the founder.
Until now, courts have awarded people relatively low compensation, sums were calculated according to tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
Polívka lost the Wallachian Kingdom
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the brand Wallachian Kingdom.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, he used the term Wallachian King for the first time, but the project was built by a long-term team around Tomáš Harabiš, who cooperated with the actor.
Polívka did not attend the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, however, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitizing on the popularity of Bolek Polívka," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, when everyone says Wallachian Kingdom, they think of an actor and a comedian.
Harabish is of the same opinion.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Raising money and inventing actions," he said.
According to him, the cause of the dispute is money.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and could benefit something from it.
They want to parasitize on our work," he added.
Lucrative business
According to the court, the term Wallachian king was first used by Polívka in his television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
At that time, however, it had nothing to do with the intention to build a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
The original prankster event turned out to be a business and lucrative business activity, which Harabiš then followed by the establishment of the company Wallachian Kingdom.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to include his name and signature on his passports and even offered their holders discounts when visiting his farm and theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš only used a bare idea that Polívka published in the manege for his business plan.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Wallachian Kingdom project," the judge said.
However, she added that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, which was intensively devoted to it.
The cooperation of the now rival parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, culminating in the deposition of "King Boleslav I. elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then taken by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as the Queen Mother at the instigation of Harabiš.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court has dismissed today.
Clarity could bring Harabiš's upcoming contest for the throne and half of the princess to the dispute.
A new king should come out of it.
He did not want to reveal details and a date yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be something like the ride of kings in Slovácko.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Even Mr. Polívka can sign up," Harabiš added.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: disappearing prejudices
Truth be told, I've never been much of a fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of shifting, steering and production could sometimes be described as below average.
But there is now a successor to the Peugeot 207 on the market, and it is much better.
And the station wagon called SW goes a little further and I have no choice but to think better.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained, for example, about the headroom in the rear seats.
That's the end of the complaints, because the station wagon body means that even two-meter longs will not suffer in this respect.
Flying around the world
I cross the interior very quickly so as not to repeat myself too much.
It is quite a good design, where the only complaint I have to the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate a little more design invention when the car already looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about the short seats or backrests.
The lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
In terms of space, you can feel the increase in body dimensions.
In the station wagon, the already mentioned lack of headroom disappears.
Suitcases in the trunk
So the main thing about this car is its luggage compartment.
I have to evaluate it as very accessible (also thanks to the hinged rear window) and as decently compact.
Blind spots are equipped with retaining rubbers, which are an ideal compromise.
It does not get in the way, it can be stretched and still holds even heavier objects.
But let's pause together on volume.
According to the tables, it is 428 l in the basic configuration, which is rather an average value compared to the competition.
But not against the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic - Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav product, we find that Peugeot lags behind by a very noticeable 52 liters.
On holiday abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is critical.
But if I had to highlight the positives, I still have to mention a completely flat floor after folding the backrests of the second row or a very low threshold.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a 1.6-litre four-cylinder petrol engine with an output of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, this is what a sixteen-hundred, which powers a family hatchback, should look like.
It is quiet, has little consumption and, above all, pulls.
If I compare it with the Škoda counterpart, which sometimes looks like it has a rag stuffed into the exhaust, I can only be excited about it.
Price list will tell
The price of the car is not popular.
However, we must bear in mind that we tested a decently equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a car with a petrol fourteen hundred for CZK 329,900 will still go.
Our aggregate costs from 410 900 CZK, which is quite a lot.
The tested Premium equipment will then add equipment for another CZK 80,000 on top.
But we also had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, electric rear windows...
Simply put, the car costs 531 900 CZK.
It's a lot, but count the additional equipment of the Fabia and you will come to a very similar number.
So all you have to do is decide on a brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, which raises concerns among local residents about the further development of local education.
Meanwhile, the integration of Eastern Europeans faces a number of obstacles.
British schools are even registering cases where disputes between immigrants and indigenous children escalate into violence.
The problem of integrating Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated by the case in North Kent, where disputes between local settlers and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Arguments, bullying and fights between pupils have also spilled over into the relationships between the parents.
The situation went so far that in Chatham police detained a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old pupil with an iron bar.
The guilty woman defends herself by saying that the boy insulted her with racist slurs.
Police also had to intervene after two teenage girls attacked a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks and threw stones at the man.
"When we were walking home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then exposed his ass," the mother of the Slovak pupils told The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One local resident even described the disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools among locals and immigrants is becoming tense.
There are 70,000 registered Slovaks registered in Britain who have come here to work.
Around 30,000 Slovak pupils attend British schools.
Cuba the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it can come true if you choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, calm as a pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands in the Caribbean Sea, you will find it in a complete and even richer list.
But only on one island you will find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
Under the Spaniards, Cuba was a bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and transshipment point for treasures that the Spaniards in America looted and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional grew up at the very end of the 20s.
It was built by one of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the US (especially during prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise houses were built, cars drove along wide boulevards, which belonged to the cult symbols of the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a homestead in San Francisco de Paula, just outside Havana, and had his yacht in Cojimar.
On the walls of Bodeguita del Medio, the stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls in Bodeguita, Havana.
The bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional will mix a cocktail according to your wishes.
And those iconic cars from the 50s are still driving around Havana, because the once imported Žigulíks and Fiats have long rotted in that salty and humid air.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is very dilapidated, there are not so many beautiful colonial monuments anywhere in the vicinity as right there.
Other places are also becoming more beautiful, such as Trinidad.
Since tourism brings much-needed money, its development has the green light.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have sprung up not only in Havana, but especially in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers one more indulgence, which is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by trainees.
Cane from large plantations was transported to sugar factories on narrow tracks by steam and motor trains.
Their fleet has not been renewed for many decades, so you can see working machines whose contours are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba will not miss.
And so there is no need to write much about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps just to remind that in the already mentioned Hemingway homestead there is a museum and who likes this writer, should not miss a visit.
Viñales Valley One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Viñales Valley in the west of the island.
Lush vegetation grows from the limestone bedrock.
Mogotes, limestone loafs and rocks rise steeply from the valley floor and fertile soil has taken hold in their cavities, making the weathered rocks covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is where perhaps the finest Cuban tobacco is grown.
With its final form you can meet if you visit one of the Havana factories for the production of cigars.
Maybe someone will find it interesting that the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
The slave and sugar trade brought him fame and fortune.
Wealth was reincarnated in the beauty and grandeur of a small town.
Colonial Spanish architecture, greatly influenced by later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a place so remote that even in the 50s of the last century there was no road that would connect the region with the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him stay away.
Nothing was built there, and therefore nothing was demolished, everyone was glad to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more time for Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth visiting the nearby interesting places such as Playa Ancón Beach or the Valley of the Sugar Factories.
In the evening, you should go to Casa de la Música, which comes alive after dark and the music in it is silent in the morning.
Baracoa
The town in the very east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
Surely the journey itself influences such a view.
The two roads leading there from Guantánamo have to cross high and rugged mountains and pass through nature that has hardly been affected by human activity.
The eastern outpost of Cuba has been inscribed by UNESCO on the World Heritage List thanks to its intact nature.
They make the best chocolate there, the church has the Columbus Cross (in fact, it was built about a century after Columbus's voyage) and from the hill where the former castle and today's El Castillo hotel stands, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, about the Sierra Maestra, about the Bay of Pigs and the Isla de Pinos, about the cabaret Tropicana, about the shrine of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about santeria, about African religions professed by the descendants of former slaves, all this could be described many pages.
But, as they rightly say, better to see once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say
According to the United States, the lack of troops and the lack of necessary equipment affects the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years, according to Defense Secretary Robert Gates.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as planned, leaders of countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to growing opposition from the Taliban movement, the eight participating states are now discussing other plans and allied coordination.
While the United States, through Defense Secretary Robert Gates, called on NATO troops to be more active this week, the United Kingdom sees a priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and stepping up development aid.
"Developments in Afghanistan are tangible, but military force may be only one part of the solution.
The other is to enable people to kick-start the further development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
Afghan insurgent activity is the highest in five years, according to U.S. military data.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to last year, and by as much as 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the Allies have reached the very limit in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan forces.
"We will have to think seriously about specific goals for the next era and ways to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop spoke in a similar vein today.
"I'm not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
There has also been controversy in recent months about whether all Allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticised for its passivity.
"The Germans have quite a large presence in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where violence is minimal and the combat demands on them are not as high as on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week described the German soldiers as lazy.
"Afghan bums exposed: Germans play while our boys fight," Sun wrote in the material, accompanied by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
Germany's Bild counterattacked and published a picture of a British unit at a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
The national debt will soar to a trillion in 2009
Every Czech has a state debt of over 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to better development of the state budget.
The state debt of the Czech Republic rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In the nine months of this year, it increased by CZK 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, it has decreased by CZK 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed today its data on the state debt from the beginning of October.
Every Czech has a debt of over 84,000 crowns.
For the whole of last year, the state was indebted by more than 111 billion crowns.
"For the time being, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for next year, we could not exceed the trillion crowns barrier until 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between CZK 900 billion and a trillion," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikora sees it similarly: "We could get to exceeding one trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly it will depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could be postponed to 2010.
But I don't anticipate this change," he said.
Debts are rising
The national debt consists of the debts of the central government and arises mainly from the accumulation of state budget deficits.
The sovereign debt is financed by treasury bills, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt has risen by CZK 38.5 billion to CZK 719.4 billion so far this year.
So far this year, the state's external debt has risen by CZK 1.7 billion to CZK 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable state debt reached CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September and has fallen by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the state debt increased to 6.5 years.
"Total debt grew by 13 percent year-on-year for the first to third quarters, which is really a lot for how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is generated mainly for bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows that there will be something to trade with when the pension reform is here," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The 2007 State Debt Financing and Management Strategy shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to better development of the state budget.
The amount consists mainly of the state budget deficit, which will probably reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the expected CZK 91.3 billion.
It also includes the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency of CZK 13.3 billion, a ten-billion reserve for pension payments, financing of government bonds worth CZK 43 billion and repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank in the amount of CZK 1.8 billion.
A woman is due to appear in court in Khartoum today for naming a teddy bear
A British teacher on trial in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced to fifteen days in jail and deported by a Khartoum tribunal on Thursday evening, her lawyer said.
A British woman has been accused of letting six- to seven-year-old pupils name a teddy bear named Mohammed, despite the fact that any depiction of the prophet of Islam is forbidden.
She was punished with lashes.
The fifty-four-year-old British teacher, working at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and rebellion, under Article 125 of Sudan's penal code, after the parents of several pupils filed a complaint with Sudan's education ministry.
In fact, our story begins in the month of September, when the teacher in question asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class's teddy bear.
"Eight names come out of the children's mouths, among them Hasan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says Robert Boulos, the school's principal.
After the class votes, 20 of the 23 children end up choosing Mohammed as their favourite name.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all it is a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a photo of a teddy bear accompanied by the caption: "My name is Mohammed."
The bear itself did not have a label with this name on it, but the problem is in the actual depiction of the prophet, considered an insult to Islam.
One Muslim colleague, Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious belief: "I only regret asking the children to vote for a name," saying it was just "innocent misconduct."
This view is shared by many of the teacher's pupils, who describe her as "very attentive to her pupils" and adding that she "never talks about religion in class".
Recall that the first name Muhammad is also the second most commonly given given name in the UK, written in English in fourteen different ways.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is a way to honor the Prophet (often bestowed on the firstborn).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, is it possible to give them to a toy?
Sure, it's a matter of interpretation.
At the latest round of negotiations in Vienna on Wednesday, they failed to reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
In the end, failure.
Serbs and Kosovo Albanians concluded their sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without overcoming differences over the separatist province's future status.
"It is regrettable that the two sides were unable to reach a status agreement," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region was "at stake" and appealed to Belgrade and Pristina to heed their commitments to keep the peace and be ready for dialogue even after the negotiations were over.
"We do not expect violence in the near term, but we are entering a difficult period," he added, adding that "it is evident that the situation is tense."
Negotiations end on December 10
Negotiators from the troika, made up of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will travel to Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent is Albanian-speaking, could become clearer on December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Kharchenko are due to submit their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and final round of negotiations since the UN tasked the troika with renegotiating in August this year.
The Americans and Europeans expect the talks to end on December 10.
Meanwhile, the Russians, who had previously blocked Kosovo's granting of independence in the UN Security Council, insist that negotiations continue beyond that deadline.
"Russia was and remains in favour of a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Bocan-Kharchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of governance by the international community, the West sees Kosovo's independence under EU supervision as the only viable solution.
Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not rule in its favour, it is prepared to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement," Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu announced at a Baden hotel, where these "last chance negotiations" had been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, a former Kosovo Albanian rebel commander and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
He added, however, that Belgrade's autonomy plan "belongs to a past that led to murders and deportations."
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic, on the other hand, believes that a compromise is still possible and has warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of a possible unilateral declaration of the province's independence.
Belgrade is said to be particularly concerned about the "domino effect" in the region, which is still unstable as a result of the wars of independence in the 90s.
"For Serbia," he said, "this does not mean that compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions should belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has veto power.
'Kosovo's parliament will have the last word'
"For Serbia, only a solution from the Security Council is acceptable," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
It must end as it began: in the Security Council."
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "Kosovo's parliament will have the final say on status," adding that if there was a unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population, it would be "in agreement" with the West.
Bush won a deal from Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of an international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, convened at his instigation, US President George Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately begin negotiations with a view to resolving once and for all the 60-year-old dispute between the two nations.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything possible to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must put an end to colonial activities, Bush said, recalling the obligations for both sides under the "road map" to peace they adopted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas aim to "conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including central issues."
The statement covers three issues at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes in what is now the state of Israel in the 1948 conflict.
Abbas took the floor after the US president, stressing that the subsequent negotiations should be "comprehensive and thorough" and that they should touch on all aspects of the solution, mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others."
Olmert then took the floor and expressed the view that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that "efforts should be made to ensure that they are concluded during 2008".
George W. Bush set the end of 2008 as the date of realizing his "vision of two states," Palestinian and Israeli, living side by side.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made a commitment to that effect from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries to offer Israel peace in exchange for abandoning all Arab territories seized during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud said in an interview with an Arabic-speaking newspaper backed by Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the police officers are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small reports from the Black Chronicle, the official versions do not coincide with what is said among the people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of an investigation by the General Inspectorate of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car drove along Louise-Michel Street in the municipality of Villiers-le-Bel shortly after 5 p.m. on Sunday.
"The vehicle was not in intervention mode, but was on patrol and was travelling at 40 to 50 km/h without the side lights on," the police source explains.
A green Kawasaki motorcycle, "unregistered and therefore unauthorised to ride on public roads" (read below), driven by two young men without helmets, was travelling at "very high speed".
"The motorcycle hit a police car from the left side after not giving way from the right," one officer said.
A blood alcohol test performed on the vehicle crew was negative.
The condition of the car (punctured front, shattered windshield, broken bumpers) testifies to the severity of the impact.
The Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givra, reacted very quickly and announced yesterday morning that she had instructed the IGPN to investigate "acts of involuntary manslaughter and failure to render assistance to persons in danger", which is also being taken over by the direction départementale de la sûreté publique du Val-d'Oise (Regional Police Directorate of the Val d'Oise department).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation conducted by the IGPN excludes, at this stage, the liability of the officers for the accident.
Three witnesses to the accident who were questioned on Sunday evening confirmed "the policemen's version, namely that the mini-motorbike approached them relatively quickly from the left," according to the official.
A groove, no doubt caused by the friction of the clips on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained wedged until the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been secured and will undergo technical expertise.
An autopsy was performed on the bodies of both victims yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel word spread rapidly among the people that the police should have left the scene of the crime without giving first aid to the two youths.
The IGPN should, in all caution, also rule out "any serious wrongdoing" on this point.
"It's a more challenging aspect of the investigation that requires more investigation and needs to be very careful with," the police source said.
The newspaper "Libération" met with an eyewitness to the few moments that followed the accident.
One of its windows leads directly to where the accident took place.
"Immediately, my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, and I ran downstairs to try to resuscitate them," the witness recounts.
There was nothing we could do."
He then saw "a limping, completely terrified policeman.
Two others tried to resuscitate one of the youths, and the fourth was talking on the phone."
Faced with rapidly rising tension and the certainty of those present that the situation of the youths was hopeless, the police were taken away by the car of colleagues who had meanwhile arrived at the scene.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about twenty minutes after the departure of the police."
They also performed a heart massage, but in vain.
"Let no one claim that the police did not come to the aid of the young men.
These youths were given first aid.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency, two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahor, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against measures taken under the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades used by riot police, according to witnesses.
The latter responded with stones, injuring several policemen.
At least 350 lawyers were summoned.
Similar scenarios to those in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
A few should have been summoned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations in the wake of a wave of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers over the weekend.
Access streets to the Supreme Court were blocked with roadblocks on Monday morning to prevent gatherings.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (central) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the lawyers' movement won the support of religious parties grouped in the politically powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president "urged the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the state of emergency and garbage to those who took oath before Musharraf."
'Musharraf's promise does not apply'
Pakistan's Supreme Court is the direct target of an emergency measure announced on Saturday night.
In the coming days, he was due to comment on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in the indirect presidential election on October 6.
The president of the court, Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, was removed and replaced.
"Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and against the judgments of the Supreme Court," the official told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to relinquish the leadership of the army and become a civilian president "does not apply" after the introduction of a state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, the date of his first presidential term.
The deputy minister of information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also refuted ongoing speculation that the deputy chief of the army should have placed President Musharraf under house arrest.
More than a third of pregnancies are still unexpected pregnancies
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected pregnancies.
More than one pregnancy in three (36%) is still unexpected, according to a study conducted by France's Institut national d'études démographiques (Ined), forty years after the adoption of the so-called Institut national d'études démographiques (Ined). Neuwirth Act, which legalized contraception in France.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected pregnancies.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraceptives and sterilization, still show a 5% to 6% failure rate, Done estimates.
The legalization of contraception has enabled better "fertility control," the institute says, noting that the rate of use of hormonal contraceptives among women between the ages of 20 and 44 has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births out of ten are now well planned.
One couple in five even has a birth calculated for a month exactly and, if possible, in spring, which is considered the most pleasant time of year for the birth of a child.
Remarkable repair of the space station
More than seven hours of space work were needed by astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew members from the International Space Station (ISS) to remarkably repair a torn solar panel necessary for the station's continued scientific work.
It was a risky spacewalk that set records in terms of duration, distance from habitable modules, the speed at which it was planned, and the amount of DIY the astronauts spent repairing it.
The trouble arose on Tuesday as Discovery astronauts unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical formation designed to install a European and Japanese science laboratory.
This module is a kind of landing pier for modules-laboratories.
However, they need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew's second task was to relocate the seventeen-and-a-half-ton solar panel-producing module, already on the ISS, to dock at its final location.
After moving it, the crew began to disassemble the module's sixty-seven-meter solar panels.
And in it, one of the panels, unfolding like an accordion, as a result of the pinching of the cable, was damaged on an area of almost one meter.
Unfolding has been suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally scheduled to perform a check ascent of Discovery, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system had failed, were forced to attend to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go fly to the end of the ship's robotic arm, added to the station's arm, and make the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalkers" (space walkers) of the US Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
Tall, sturdy, very agile, he has a very elaborate chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, he was tasked by profession to "operate" on an "injured" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut the faulty cable and attached a kind of "splints" to the damaged places.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained near the surge chamber, and also from within, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The tools he used, a mini hockey stick covered with an insulating agent to prevent electroshock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and DIY made by astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was completely disassembled and then inventoried his tools and returned to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day rest before today, when the seven astronauts return to Discovery to return to Earth on Wednesday as scheduled.
EADS shares fall
EADS shares are losing heavily on the Paris Stock Exchange after the aerospace and defence company announced it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to counter the A400M's delay.
EADS lost 4% and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange at 21.96 euros.
The financial group was forced to revise its expected production results for 2007 due to delays caused by the slow progress of the development of the A400M engine, which is a condition for the initial flight.
The cost of mitigating delays in deliveries of the military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was put at "1.2 to 1.4 billion euros, of which more than a billion for Airbus", the parent company of European designer EADS announced.
Because of these costs, EADS will be forced to report a new earnings outlook before interest and taxes (EBIT) next Thursday when presenting its quarterly results.
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
Recall that EADS' production results fell 86% in 2006, mainly due to costs associated with delays to another program, the giant A380.
Initially, the group expected to deliver the first A400M to the French military in October 2009.
Deciding for the status quo
Sunday's election will go off without anticipation: Russians will overwhelmingly elect President Putin's party, United Russia.
Thus reaffirming, after the end of the very little free election campaign, their inclination towards stability, even authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the elections to the Chamber of Deputies, Russian President Vladimir Putin will give voters a pre-recorded television message on public broadcasters, the content of which is kept secret.
He is doing so as leader of United Russia, a pro-Kremlin party that looks set to celebrate a landslide victory.
When he received the ambassadors of foreign states yesterday, the president did not let anything come out of him and contented himself with another attack on the West, accused of meddling - his favorite topic during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, as transparent and open elections as possible, elections without the slightest blemish," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is far from the case.
They condemn a campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says that "there have never been such dirty elections, not even under Yeltsin."
After last weekend's repression of last weekend's demonstrations, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, is still banned from visitors, according to his vocalist.
"Russians retained the homo sovietica mentality"
Behind these parliamentary elections, devoid of tense expectations, two far more open questions are emerging:
"Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
Yesterday, the Official Gazette published the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; Candidates can present themselves to the public until 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third consecutive term.
However, no follower appears.
"What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be prime minister?
Or the leader of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, which chooses the government and the president?
Be that as it may, the outgoing ruling power will win the parliamentary as well as the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"Russians have retained the homo sovietica mentality, they do not feel they are masters of their fate," believes sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada Center.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University notes a more distant context: civil society has fallen behind in a country Christianized five centuries after Europe; That glorious common spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the nineties, "Putin followed the paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, all the more so because this new paternalism was accompanied not by terror, but by a certain economic well-being," argues Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, Russians are "voluntarily abdicating the personal responsibility" they briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why think about?"
This phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
Even the bureaucratic elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 heads of Russian regions) manage the local lists of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the nineties, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion favours stability.
Also, in the name of stability, Russians will not vote for extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednichenko, a fifty-four-year-old professor: "Why think?
Those in power are not so bad, so why change them?"
Memory load
After more than sixty years in a confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which recount the fate of 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, are open to the public.
Until then, the 47 million archival documents stored in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) over a length of 27 km had been accessible only for "humanitarian" purposes, that is to say, individually and by name, at the request of the former victim or his or her legitimate persons.
Eleven states in charge of managing the archives - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scholars and historians.
As the process of ratification of this agreement by all states is complete, the opening took effect yesterday.
Sensitive information
Free access for historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to examine "in particular the movements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of forced laborers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the Comité international de la Croix-rouge (CICR).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, were opposed to the disclosure of these named documents to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Such as the presumed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants compiled by the Gestapo were collected after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced labor civilians, providing them with proof of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited benefit.
"Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents," Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism at Berlin's Technische Universität, said in 2006.
EU and India want free trade agreement in 2008
Today, bilateral trade between Europe and India is almost €60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner, accounting for 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India are expected to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath have announced.
Last April, EU foreign ministers gave the green light to the European Commission to start negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (accords de libre échange, ALEs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Bilateral trade between Europe and India already amounts to almost €60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the EU's ninth trading partner, according to the European Commission.
"A free trade agreement will give a huge boost to both economies" and "India will gain better market access for 450 million prosperous Europeans," argued Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. The Asian and European giants will exchange "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in services" annually, Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, said this week, regretting that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its full potential." The EU and India will meet on Friday for the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England took note of concerns and offered £10 billion in a five-week auction
The Bank of England on Thursday signalled that it intends to ease current fears that credit market conditions will deteriorate again and announced a £10 billion bid at a five-week auction at a key interest rate of 5.75%, an offer that has been in place for an unusually long time.
"In an effort to alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be very unfavourable towards the end of the year and to give banks more certainty in how to hedge their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserve during the maintenance period starting on December 6 in the form of a five-week open market operation," the Bank said in a communiqué.
The bank says £10 billion (€14 billion) will be placed on the financial market on December 6 at 12.15pm GMT until January 10, at the base interest rate.
This appears to be the first time the BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
Normally they last a week.
The BOE adds in its communiqué that it "remains ready to take further measures to keep interest rates" on interbank lending on a day-to-day basis with its base rate.
The overnight interbank interest rate was at 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate settled at 6.6%, the highest since Sept. 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, sums placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been associated with fee rates that have discouraged banks from taking advantage of this offer.
According to some speculation strengthened by the development of the pound-euro exchange rate, many have opted for sums placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
The UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire) and the NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to consider the Socialists' (PS) proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss paragraphs of the socialist purchasing power bill on Thursday, which amounts to rejecting the text.
The text of the bill was put on the agenda within the so-called "Bill". It included a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the PA presidency, including a 50% increase in the employment premium, the renewal of fluctuating TIPP, a transport cheque and rent control.
As the UMP and NC voted against the discussion of the individual paragraphs (180 votes to 115), the meeting was closed after a general debate, which became an opportunity for an exchange, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's televised appearance on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS deputies, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that his group will resubmit these proposals in their entirety in the form of amendments to the Finance Bill, which will be debated by the House next week.
A new festival is born
As a result of much speculation that C3 Presents is starting a new festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announced the Vineland Festival in New Jersey in partnership with the Republic Festival of British organizer Melvin Benn.
"It is an honor for our company to work with a man who, without exaggeration, has inspired the current festival movement in America," said Charlie Jones of C3 Billboard.com.
C3 produces Chicago's Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camper's destination.
The festival is scheduled to take place August 8-10 at a 500-acre private farm, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Festival director Republic, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most respected festival organizers.
In 1989 he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006 Festival Republic founded Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been in charge of production, licensing and organising tasks at Glastonbury Festival, which today has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
C3's Charlie Jones calls Glastonbury "the most inspiring event" he's ever experienced, and says his company and Melvin Benn's firm are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival event.
"We originally chose Philadelphia as the market, and we worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to establish a festival in downtown Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We talked to the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, due to the current city leadership, we got bogged down in politics, adds Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we've had a chance to have a discussion with Melvin Benn, and we're going to establish a great festival in an exceptional location that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago's Grant Park in 2005, after promining the festival scene in 2002 by hosting the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Gross sales of both events for 2007 were $9.8M$11.3M$3 respectively.
Both of these festivals take place in an urban environment.
"The European Melvin Benn festival model takes place in the countryside, whereas our festivals tend to take place in green spaces in cities," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine both concepts in a certain way to create the impression of a rural festival in the European way and an urban festival in the American way."
Vineland is located roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The municipality of Vineland, including the mayor, is enthusiastically supporting this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to divulge the terms of the deal, but says they are "profitable enough to allow investment in such an event and welcome a festival that will hopefully be long-lasting."
Charlie Jones says the capacity of the festival is "very high," similar to that of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which holds 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent to the groups, but nothing can be confirmed yet when the program is still in print.
"Vineland will have a rock feel, but the music will be varied to attract a wide range of audiences if possible," says Carlie Jones.
C3, which received the Top Independent Promoter award at the last annual Billboard Touring Awards, partners are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to lure Hollywood movie studios to Montreal when the Terminator itself opposes it...
This persuasion mission is one of the delegate's tasks.
But his mandate is "politically challenging" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions."
Is it difficult to fall into the "Governor's claws"??
"You have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, he will go there.
Our role is to offer those that they think are the best," he said.
The Hunt for Festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is to promote local film.
The hunt for the Oscars has already begun.
At all West Coast festivals, whether it's Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it's about showcasing Quebec films, highlighting them, and ensuring directors give interviews.
The Age of Darkness received good publicity at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
Also this month, Quebec presented four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a marathon on the stock market at the end of the year? Experts divided by 'subprime' crisis
With less than five weeks left until the end of the administrative year, investors are already rubbing their hands in anticipation of the traditional end-of-year marathon.
This year, however, experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Bank Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December tends to be positive on the stock exchange".
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts solely on the basis of statistics, especially because in the current context the markets offer some doubts, at least in the short term."
These experts do not expect the stock market to move in the last weeks of the year, stating that "the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest in the absence of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income influenced by the effect of the turn to quality securities, both in long and short periods."
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will have a calm course, rather than without volatility, "mainly because the impact of the likely fall in rates of the Federal Reserve is unknown, given the high level of oil prices and the danger of incentives for inflationary pressures."
Javier Barrio, BPI's sales manager in Spain, agrees that this is not the time to make bold claims that there will be a marathon.
"There is not much reason to rejoice," assures the expert.
Ibex lost almost 4% from its peak on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Yet not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes the Ibex 35 could end the year a little closer to 16,000 points thanks to portfolio reshuffling and traditional pension deposits occurring at this time each year.
However, the expert suggests that things will be a little different this year, as he believes the marathon will happen earlier, in the second week of December after the long weekend on the occasion of Constitution Day.
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the direction of the market.
At the same time, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, estimates that we are approaching technical levels and "therefore we could see a reflection of the index, triggered by news from the US about the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on the selection of titles that will take care to bring the Ibex to the new maximum dimensions.
Solana of Intermoney confirms that "this year it is the turn of strong titles".
The expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive."
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that the increases will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sectors.
Construction companies will also be able to enrich themselves at this marathon if it happens.
"ACS has been regaining ground for several months and we hope that other construction companies, such as the Structural Authority, will be able to regain its position. Ferrovial and the FCC will go the same way," the expert explains.
Cyclical consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year thanks to an increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technology will also perform very well, although it is not very represented in this field on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been a month of declines only on two occasions.
The real end-of-year marathon was in 2003, the administrative year when stock markets ended the crisis triggered by the bursting of the tech bubble.
This year, when the Ibex 35 regained 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
It remains to be seen whether 2007 will be the fifth profitable year (so far, the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it will manage to have its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular Bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Popular Bank has decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches, operated under the Popular Max brand, are a big change for the bank.
The same applies to other Spanish entities, since it is the first group to make such a leap and bet on the continuous opening hours of its branches until 20.30 and open on Saturday from 10.00 to 20.30.
BBVA, another group that has also repeatedly said it wants to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided to do so.
Meanwhile, it intends to strike a deal with the unions to cancel the opening hours of 75% of its branches on Saturdays in exchange for an extension of opening hours by one afternoon, although not for the public.
The results of this experience of Popular Bank will be decisive for other players to join this initiative, which supports store opening hours, or not.
This is precisely the aim of the project set out by Popular Bank.
To get individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, small and medium-sized companies, tradesmen and shops from selected streets where branches will open.
The bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain in about 18 months, as this is not about opening new branches, but only about modifying existing ones.
For this reason, the bank will modernize the branches it already has in business areas by adapting them to the profile of clients in each street.
Thus, the extension of opening hours is complemented by a different concept of the branch area and a new, more up-to-date design in lighter colors.
The bank's chief commercial officer, Ángel Rivera, assures that this restructuring will not mean a big investment, but more recruitment, as it moves from six employees per branch to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with meeting spaces for small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group.
Banka Popular has already tested the initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel Rivera explains.
Branches in Madrid's Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets were chosen, and according to Rivero, it seems to have been a lucky choice.
Popular Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 immigrant specialists, which are operated under the Mundocredit brand, also have very long opening hours and are open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax affiliates will not follow the BBVA model, with a number of its affiliates offering a large range of non-financial products for sale.
"We don't want to compete with our clients," says Rivera.
They have just agreed with Telefónica to sell the mobile phones through external staff.
Telecinco doubled the value of its rival Antenna 3 for the first time on the stock exchange
We did it'.
With this sentence, Paolo Vasile, executive chairman of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the end of trading, when he stated that the television he manages has doubled the value of its rival Antena 3.
Only one thing spoiled his joy: 'What I regret is that it was not because we had risen more, but because we had fallen less', he said.
And he stressed that because of the weak market, 'we fell less'.
Telecinco ended trading yesterday with a move of 2.54%.
This gain pushed their loss for the past part of the year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the stock market value of the company, controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) with the participation of Vocent (another 13%), is EUR 4,488.88 million.
Its competitor Antena 3, which fell 1.52% yesterday and fell 40.5% overall since January, is worth half as 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications firms valued is €3.571 billion for Sogecable, €2,518.53 million for Prisa (publisher Cinco Días) and €1.779 billion for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is possible because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what price, and how we value it in viewership."
Telecinco announced last week that it expects to become the first television channel to surpass one billion in gross advertising revenue this year, according to Giuseppe Tringali, executive chairman of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that provides advertising for the group.
If the forecast figure were to materialize, the channel would see its advertising revenue grow by 3.6% this year, up from 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, Antena 3's net sales increased by 1.6% (reaching 734.4 million), while Antena 3's net revenue increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors on which analysts are focusing on the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the increased pay out that it has maintained until now: in 2006, the company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, distributed 100% of its profits to its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is too early to decide, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, for whom we have already increased the value of 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is showing some fatigue at this moment.
Lehman Brothers recently lowered its Telecinco earnings estimates, to 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is because, they explain, revenue growth has stalled from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced Antena 3's forecast profit of 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 Opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends purchasing both titles primarily on the basis of increased yield for dividends and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: rates Telecinco (hoard) better than Antena 3 (keep) due to its 'numerous strengths' and business growth.
3.
JPMorgan: in both cases, it recommends not to overestimate them, as they face 'similar threats' (an oversaturated market and a worsening economic environment).
Congress approves MiFID transposing effective November 1
In parallel with the parliamentary deliberations that concluded today with a congressional vote on amendments incorporated by the Senate into the bill, the government has subjected a public hearing to an ordinance that develops the new law, with the aim of both entering into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of individual parties unanimously highlighted the efforts of deputies and senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard to guarantee investor protection and detailed regulation of the activities of entities necessary for the effective functioning of markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, envisages the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisory bodies of the European Union.
The new legislation will make it possible to provide financial advisory services to specialised firms as well as natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services firm (ESIS), financial advice companies (AFIs) that join securities companies, securities brokerage offices and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of venues for the execution of transactions in financial instruments is being extended by connecting MTFs and order internalisation systems to regulated secondary markets to compete with existing stockbrokers.
The law also obliges investment services firms to disseminate information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management methods to the market, and requires a statement of all operations carried out to simplify oversight by the CNMV.
During the Congressional Trade Committee hearings, several amendments were introduced, among which the one stands out to treat securitized claims as a "complex" financial instrument due to the high danger to the investor, which has been demonstrated by what has happened in the US with high-risk mortgage debt (subprime).
Moreover, the transposition of the directive has been used to legally define the functions that bachelors in economics and business management can hold 30 years after a royal decree was passed in 1977 outlining the professional functions reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary that will work externally, will not require permission from the CNMV and will be able to provide services of trading in products and acquiring clients for various investment firms at the same time.
Harmonised CPC increased by five-tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which is later used by Eurostat to calculate the European Union inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices in Spain developed during the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the policy of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This provisional indicator is calculated using the same process as used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (National Institute of Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this provisional indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily coincide with the final figure that will become known on 14 December this year.
"ISC will continue to be maintained at a relatively high level"
Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes said that the increase in CPI to 4.1% in November was a "temporary number", but he also predicted that the price index would remain at a relatively "high level" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes clarified in the corridors of Congress that "even if it is not a favorable number", Spain's inflation differential against the monetary union has been "more or less" the same over the past two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month, when the government had not anticipated such a large increase.
"We expected a figure of around 4%", the economy minister said of today's figure.
Virgin plans to earn €42 billion with Northern Rock over three years
Since Northern Rock went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have plummeted by more than 50% to £12 billion (€16.8 billion).
At the time, the bank managed record deposits worth more than £25 billion, which gradually declined over the course of two and a half months due to customer distrust, even though the government had offered a hundred per cent guarantee for the money and would extend it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which will replace the entity with its financial business brand Virgin Money, needs to raise around a quarter of the revenue invested in UK banks over the next three years to raise the remaining £18 billion and reach the £30 billion target.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known in the UK for his eye-catching advertising campaigns, plans to spend £50 million (about €70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its resolution.
Northern Rock this week identified the offer from the Virgin consortium, which makes up three other companies, as the one it would prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged corrupt practices in construction
The Civil Guard detained the current mayor of the Murcia town of Totana (from the People's Party) in the early hours of this morning for his alleged involvement in corrupt construction practices that were exposed this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the town hall and the chief of the local police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current People's Party MP and until then mayor of the municipality, who, according to investigative sources contacted by Cadena SER television, could have been the 'head' of the entire enterprise.
Police continue to monitor the buildings of the town hall and the construction commission, and no further arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in corrupt practices during the construction, which were revealed earlier this week, was charged.
As Cadena SER reported yesterday, the lawyer of 'EPP' MP Juan Morales, who was under investigation, was arrested while leaving Morales' residence with important corruption-related documents.
In addition, according to investigative sources, the subject of the investigation is Morales' alleged collection of commissions for his signing of a construction agreement with a Galician construction company that reclassified 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently detained.
Bono accepted the offer to head the Toledo PSOE list and, if they won, to preside over Congress
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted an offer from Prime Minister and Socialist Secretary General José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to head the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) list in Toledo in the next general election and become President of Congress if the Socialists win the general election.
This was announced at a press conference by the PSOE's secretary for the organization, José Blanco, and by Bono himself, after a meeting with Zapatero that took place today at noon at the party's federal headquarters.
The chief executive justified the offer to the former minister by saying that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems" that the politician from La Mancha will be the Socialist Party's candidate for President of Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín, who on November 15 announced his decision not to run in the next general election and to abandon his active political career to devote himself to fighting climate change in university education.
The former minister admitted that the prime minister constantly urged him to return to top politics, which he left two years ago.
He went on to say that just as citizens know who the deputy economy minister will be if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce in a "transparent way" who would preside over Congress.
If Bono wins the job, he hopes to transform the House into "a house of respect, not insults or shouting" and making it "more and more like a citizen."
"Unfortunately, it sometimes seems that the only place in Madrid where it is not possible to speak in peace and quiet is Congress, the Prime Minister in the Senate has been interrupted 26 times on one occasion."
He also spoke highly of the current president, Manuel Marín, and "his good work" and did not want to put himself in his place for the time being, lest he stoop to what his opponents might consider "megalomania."
Climate propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change is being mercilessly persecuted both by those who view its predictions with skepticism and by those who prefer other political and social struggles, it must demonstrate strong cohesion.
And, moreover, to have a leader of the movement who is a prime minister like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This proposal forces him to explain why the actions or inactions of his government have contributed significantly to Spain's leading European Union in non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this non-compliance, in which sectors it is happening and why his government, the contract government, did not prevent it.
Moreover, it forces him to explain as clearly as possible to Spaniards what measures he intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be harmed, which habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, both individual and collective, will we have to accept and what the economic consequences will be.
In other words, who will sacrifice themselves and who will pay to save the planet.
But we have not received and will not receive such explanations.
Precisely because it is necessary to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, inconvenient and threatening corporate and private accounts.
Even one centime of the price of gasoline, proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), seemed so risky to Zapatero in terms of elections that he hurried to reject it.
In other words, it is a matter of saving the planet at no cost, pure propaganda, slogans devoid of any real meaning.
With impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And contracts with the planet; This gentleman, so useful for election campaigns, who neither speaks, accuses, demands anything, but adorns meetings and arouses tenderness.
If it limits itself to being a virtual contracting party and does not ask us to ride a bike and cool down with a fan.
Mayor and local police chief Totany detained on suspicion of corrupt practices in construction
According to investigative sources, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the Murcia town of Totana, the "People's Party" José Martínez Andreo, the local police chief, the secretary of the town hall and a hospitality businessman, on suspicion of committing crimes during construction.
The mayor was arrested at his residence and taken to the town hall, where he is now located along with a number of police officers, who also appeared before the Building Commission and the Municipal Enterprise for the Management of Industrial Land and Housing.
The three arrests are in addition to the six that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation to reclassify more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land as land suitable for development, so that the Galician firm Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the last parliamentary term, could build 4 000 houses there.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged in summary proceedings before the Court of First Instance of the City of Totana.
The first six arrestees were handed over to court today.
According to information sources, the previous mayor of Totana and now a member of the autonomous parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, is under investigation.
His ex-wife, the owner of a real estate agency now registered in Totana, and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region, were also charged.
Manuel N.A., director and owner of the Nuaria group, a lawyer and businessman from Vigo, was arrested in Nigrán (province of Pontevedra), as was Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, a company belonging to that group, through which bribes were transferred.
The investigation is being carried out by the Criminal Offences Group under construction of the operational central unit of the Civil Guard, whose members, in addition to arresting them, also carried out eleven searches, mostly at companies related to the arrestees, based in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (province of Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was imprisoned in Totana at the time, and that was a well-known owner of a poultry meat products company who could have served as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group has been commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the Murcian city of Totany, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two "spa" hotels.
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which was requalified, and its project was to double the population of the municipality, which has a population of 25,000.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are dedicated to supporting the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking on Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico Square in Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing, and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
That happens, too

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday's edition of Finland's most important newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (incidentally, at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper printed on November 18, the same day that the criticism of Blackburn's book happened to appear there:
"The content of the subject of philosophy has seeped into public discussions in connection with the tragedy at the school in the town of Jokela.
The victim killer, a high school student, quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
Pekka Elo, the councillor for education responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded in the pages of Helsingin Sanomat that professors take a critical stance on Plato, arguing that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory basic course of philosophy in secondary schools.

One colleague reports on the introduction of the crime of downloading from the Internet into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading one song would be a crime punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal plates worth less than €400 in a shop, it is considered a mere offence (Section 623.1).
B. If you steal up to €1,000 from a shop, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than for downloading (Section 234 of the Judicial Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty is still lower than for downloading (Section 244.1)
D. It is less serious to be involved in a brawl than to be in a compact shift.
Participation in a riot is punishable by three months to one year (Section 154 of the Criminal Code) and the replacement of compacts would be punishable by six months to two years
(Section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious under Section 184.2 of the Criminal Code than downloading a film on DVD.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted films is punished more severely than the provision of pornographic material to minors (Section 186).
So if my colleague is not mistaken, someone's hand has been missed, and a lot of it.

My attending physician shoves me one of his articles about strange research titled "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
In other words, the feelings that employees feel about their monthly pay depend on how much colleagues earn.
The research was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging on a tomograph and the results are published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, study author and head of the neurocognition imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, "The greatest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his colleague incorrectly."
The researchers observed that if both succeeded, they received the same salary, the activation was moderate, but when one got double, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been mercilessly pursuing Balkan war criminals from the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Court of Justice in The Hague.
Her mandate expires at the end of the year, and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre that killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list from which Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach's documentary "Karla's List" (2006, not shown in Spain) takes its name, which, in the pace of a detective thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor in pursuing escaped criminals and pressuring the relevant states to pull the net.
Which insurance is right for me?
Car insurance to protect the driver in the event of an accident. It represents a considerable expense which depends on various factors such as age, status, gender, length of possession of a driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, it is necessary to clarify what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured person.
This commitment takes the form of an insurance contract, which provides that the insurance company receives an agreed sum insured in a certain amount in return for taking charge of paying damages in the event of an insured event.
Insurance premiums are the price of insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors such as age, status, gender, length of time to hold a driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the greater the likelihood of an accident occurring, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, based on inspections, insurance companies concluded that married people had fewer accidents than single drivers.
The way a vehicle is used will affect the frequency of journeys and therefore the likelihood that it will have an accident.
As the frequency of trips increases, the probability increases.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when setting the price of premiums.
Therefore, the driver must study the situation well in order to choose the insurance that best fits his profile as an insured person.
We will show you the most important variables for choosing this or that type of insurance, which, in addition to meeting the type of policyholder, will also be reasonably priced.
People under the age of twenty-five encounter various disadvantages, such as little driving experience and short holding of a driver's license when they want to buy insurance premiums at an affordable price.
Although insurance against all risks is ideal for good coverage, there are also cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can choose insurance against all risks with a discount on premiums so as to get insurance coverage for all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would assume the client's participation in the payment of the insured event.
"The part of the claim provided by the customer will be determined in advance when setting the premium price, which will be all the higher the lower the deductible", explains Luis Noguera, Chief Executive of First Europe in Spain, an online insurance broker.
Another option is insurance extended to other road users so that the client insures himself against damage caused to other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, it would be insured against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
Recommendation.
If you are under the age of twenty-five, try to be attentive and avoid crashes as much as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce premiums in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the base rate that an insurance company has.
On the other hand, malus is an increase in the basic rate.
"The bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus," Noguera explains.
After exceeding the twenty-five age mark, drivers have it easier when they go to take out insurance, because the client's risk index decreases, thanks to the experience they have gained.
For this reason, it is most recommended to arrange insurance against all risks at a discount.
"Young people usually cannot benefit from the experience gained in advance when an accident occurs, nor when driving," assures the director of a European company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, when the "fear of the newcomer" has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is better to arrange insurance against all risks, if his economic situation allows.
Families with children are considered by insurance companies to be the clients with the lowest risk index and therefore their surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with a discount premium (which could amount to 300 euros) or at a high bonus, insurance extended to other road users, starting from the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their driving is calmer and their purchasing power is higher, so they can afford the luxury of getting the highest discount," says Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are advised to take out insurance against all risks with a premium discount (€150) or to cover other road users if a high bonus has been achieved.
It has to be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it protects drivers in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a considerable expense, which is a good reason to study the insurance options that would suit us best in view of our personal circumstances.
Celtic try to get a point at AC Milan that means the eighth round
AC Milan and Celtic will face off this Tuesday at the San Siro stadium in a bid to get the point they need to achieve their respective goals at the end of the Champions League, as it would mean being first for the Italians and would decide the Scots' place for them.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured promotion in the fifth leg with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic have nine points but need one more to make sure Shakhtor does not get ahead of them with six points, who will play Benfica, who have four.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where they will play thirteenth in the semi-finals for the first time, in an attempt to advance to the final, which is played on the sixteenth.
So this group will be closed before the others and a tie at the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium seems the most likely, although both teams will try to fight for victory, as the Italians will not want to tactically on home soil and Celtic know that after a win they would be first and secure a better place in the eight-finals.
Gordon Strachan's men could even need a loss if Shakhtor doesn't win, but they can't count on that, because with the same nine points, the Ukrainians, who lost in Glasgow last week (2-1) but won in the first straight match (2-0), will advance.
And so AC Milan's players will try to spoil the evening for the Scots, who are confident of reaching the semi-finals of the reorganised Champions League for a second time, just as they beat them in the same match in the previous competition with a goal by Kaká in extra time (1-0) after a 0-0 win in regular time.
Hoping that the "rossoneri" will win will be Shakhtyor, for whom victory is worth it if only Celtic lose, both to advance to the eight-finals and to remain in UEFA.
Benfica, despite being last and unable to continue in Europe's top competition, could reach third place with one victory, so they would play in UEFA.
The first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver was attended by 20,000 people
The Spice Girls began their first tour since breaking up in 2000 in Vancouver, Canada in front of 20,000 spectators.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sports Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before kicking off their concert at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver declared that their band's reunion was "great."
About 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, which included a video recounting the history of the group that caused a sensation in the late nineties.
The return and world tour coincide with the release of a new album released in Spain by EMI, which features a selection of their major successful songs, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
The five Spice Girls appeared on stage adorned with bracelets given to them by "Posh Spice's husband", British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in the audience that flooded GM Place, even though a nervous Victoria forbade him a few days ago.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham said of the British star that "he hasn't seen our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he'll think of the show."
"Spice Sports", whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to differences between us" caused the dissolution of the five-member group two years later, also expressed her nervousness during a meeting with journalists two hours before the start of the performance.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that world public opinion had changed, my opinion of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought, why not, so I'm glad I decided," Chisholm said of the reunion of the group she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have settled down and we all love each other very much."
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So in the beginning, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines.
On arrival, an army of nannies was waiting for them at the airport.
The five have a total of 7 children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
He will perform in Madrid on December 23.
Fears of a new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
With a dispute between Russia and Ukraine over natural gas prices, there is an increasing risk that Russian supplies of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is pipeline through Ukraine, and any dispute between the two countries is closely watched.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises gas prices for Ukraine, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
A previous dispute between the two last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes as the Ukrainian government and Russia's state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more, having agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it obtains from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinach told Reuters.
"Changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees [to Western Europe] through Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a reduction in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a crushing fall in exports to Western Europe, which sharply increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of supplies to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it remains underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom replenishes its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS 'must control foreign workers'
The Comptroller said the Scottish NHS Chambers needed to improve criminal record checks on non-European staff.
The recommendation from Supreme Audit Office President Robert Black came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was linked to the June attacks on Glasgow airport.
Mr Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS does not have a precise idea of the amount of foreign staff it employs.
But his report emphasized that other key checks were carried out in order on a sample of five health authorities.
In the wake of the attacks on Glasgow Airport in June, the President of the Supreme Audit Office took an interest in personnel recruited from outside the European Economic Area.
Twenty-eight-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone drove a Jeep into the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court via video bridge accused of links to bomb attempts in the UK.
NHS chambers are expected to check foreign personnel for qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the UK prior to their employment.
Although Scotland's health commissions use Disclosure Scotland for criminal background checks, the agency has no authority to obtain such information outside Britain.
The report by the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations, that the commissions should be guided by the guidelines of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with audits in several countries.
"Although we found that part of the staff records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out regularly," the report said.
Mr Black said the NHS Scotland was in line with its own pre-staff clearance policy, but added: "Our report highlights areas where the system could be improved to ensure that accurate information on the amount of foreign staff is available."
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-staff checks would identify potential NHS staff who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-staff checks in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is unclear what additional value these comments will bring," he said.
Health Authorities Scotland have said they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the president of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these numbers are likely to be higher also because the commissions had trouble identifying personnel with residence permits.
The survey also found that established audit procedures at NHS bodies in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
They included checks on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising its pre-staff screening policy and guidelines for NHS foreign workers.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to do this work immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport.
She added that the Scottish Government, in agreement with health commissions, would consider the report's recommendations and ensure best practice appeared in the updated guidelines for pre-staff screening of all staff - including foreign staff - which it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division wins film awards
Control, a biopic about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, won five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including Best Picture.
Awards were also given to star Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn and Toby Kebell in a supporting role.
Lady Judi Dench was named Best Actress for the thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And James Bond star Daniel Craig won a Variety award for bringing British cinema to the world stage.
The awards were presented at London's Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis' path to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film – whose soundtrack includes The Killers, David Bowie and New Order – cost just £3 million.
But Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for his iconic U2 album cover Joshua Tree, won two awards – Best Director and Best Debuting Director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning winner - as Julien Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for Best Documentary.
The Best Actor badge went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Croenberg's London thriller Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, won the Richard Harris Award for outstanding contributions to British cinema.
The fifty-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the next episode of Indiana Jones - Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud of the award, which is named after the star of the films Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened doors for people like me," he added.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my man, a great actor of his time, I'm very honored."
The independent film awards, known as Bifs, are awarded by a jury of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bif advocates and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 people for terror plot
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for being members of cells preparing an imminent attack on an oil facility, as well as spiritual and security forces.
State television said the world's largest oil exporter said one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles into the country.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have campaigned against the monarchy, an ally of the United States, since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
A television report reported that a cell of eight militants led by a foreigner was planning an attack on an oil facility in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia is building a 35,000-strong rapid reaction force to defend the facility since al-Qaeda's failed attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted an internal statement from the ministry as saying that 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell headed by a "rocket launch expert" who had slipped into the country.
She said the militants planned to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
22 detainees were supposed to be preparing the murder of clerics and security personnel.
The government urged clerics to do more to prevent Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting allied troops and a U.S.-backed Shiite government that conservative Sunni Saudis consider heretical.
Al-Qaeda militants believe the authorities have co-opted many clerics in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
The militants — backed by calls by al-Qaeda leader Saud Osama bin Laden to target the pro-Western Saudi government — targeted foreign apartment complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war was a huge effort by the security forces in the past... five months," an internal ministry spokesman told state television.
A 16-member "media cell" in Medina was also arrested to promote "Takfiri thinking" — the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that encourages violence against Muslims labeled as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate on Venus may be a glimpse into Earth's future
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live.
Data from an orbiting European station show that the planet is even more like Earth's headstrong twin than previously thought.
Venus is Earth's closest planetary neighbor.
The two worlds are roughly the same size and follow similar orbits, but Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, conditions on Venus were similar to those on Earth and may have been habitable.
But the runaway greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation, and a lower rotational speed have sent Venus down a completely different path of evolution.
Today, the planet is waterless, the surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and devastated by hurricane-force storms and winds.
Findings from the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft, which studied the planet for a year, offer a modest glimpse of how Earth might evolve in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the University of Oxford's Department of Physics and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "It is becoming increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, even though the planets themselves are otherwise quite similar.
"Our new data make it possible to construct a scenario in which Venus, like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment, began billions of years ago."
Police seize 'enriched uranium'
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people had been detained and the material was being examined.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said the substance could be sold for $1 million (£480,000).
Still wide open
Mitt Romney said it was not dignified for presidential candidates to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to a YouTube debate in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and forwarded them to the candidates for broadcast.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday, November 28, were as comical as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in a second-party debate on YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time reflected much about the state of the Republican Party heading into next year's election.
It's unclear exactly how producers from CNN, one of the sponsors of the debate, selected the clips to be shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This issue is one of the strongest Republican themes.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the wheel when they heard something gratifying: the announcer saw peaks of approval as candidates talked about a tough approach at the border.
The hardest and longest exchange took place between Rudy Giuliani, the nation's leading candidate, and Mr. Romney, who scrambled ahead in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation of a man who, as mayor of New York, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his home.
The two struggled particularly fiercely, when questioners asked if either candidate would support "amnesty" (giving illegal immigrants normal status and citizenship).
Supporting candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, have managed to throw their bit into the mill.
Neither of the two has a chance of being nominated, but both remain in the game, perhaps because they have sounded the immigration alarm earlier and harder than the others.
On immigration, at least, the candidates have roughly the same view: more strictness at the border, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This issue, along with concerns about toxic toys from China and other concerns about the outside world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the rift between libertines and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became very uncomfortable when it came to other topics.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One interviewer asked if the candidates believed every word in the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani stumbled through to the conclusion that even though the Bible was his favorite book, he probably didn't believe literally the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee — who is now against all odds in first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his longtime Christian conservatism — said the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Pressed to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, earning him laughter.
The duel remains extremely open.
Mr. Huckabee's surge in Iowa coincides with recent fundraising successes and Ron Paul's loud cheerfulness at Wednesday's debate.
The two have bounced back as both wings of the party still can't agree on more familiar and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very early and convincingly with a winning message of American greatness on his lips, winking at both wings of the party.
This time, the party is divided, and the outcome is far from clear-cut.
Labour's Pain
Gordon Brown again found a trap into which he could fall; His way out remains the same.
While this is customary for British political scandals, this one is not particularly spicy.
No orders seem to have been sold, no bills in a Parisian hotel have been mysteriously paid, no extramarital fingers have been sucked.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown could do without discovering that some wealthy businessman had masked £650,000 ($1.3 million) in contributions to the ruling Labour Party under the names of other people for four years, and that the party had failed to report it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling an election and insulted the British intelligentsia by claiming that the decision was not influenced by the polls, there was hope that he would ensure a resilient and effective government.
Instead, as the increasingly witty deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats put it, the once-feared Mr. Brown has changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of troubled Northern Rock bank showed weaknesses in management and poor judgment under fire.
Ill-conceived proposals to change the tax code have united companies against the government.
The loss of personal data for 25 million people has exposed unimaginable administrative bungling.
A trio of retired generals started a mutiny in the House of Lords; They protested against cuts in military spending, arguing that being commander of the armed forces was a part-time job.
Now there are multi-edged gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's general secretary (and former guardian of internal discipline), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading for his end.
Despite this, governments can reach a tipping point beyond which they find governing difficult.
The people don't trust politicians and don't like them, but they usually push aside their distrust when a new bunch takes over.
When it seems clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve anything, and may not even be in office for long, the relegation is gone: the civil service becomes leaky, ministers start briefing, the press looks for bad news, and the government becomes distracted and defensive.
In one respect, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot assume the position of a new broomstick.
As much as he would like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the IRS records are linked to the decisions Mr Brown made as Chancellor of the Exchequer.
And even if he wasn't directly involved in Blairite troubles, such as a lengthy investigation into party financing caused by "ranks for money," voters may well conclude that he was.
Yet Mr. Brown's troubles are not as bad as they seem.
The blunders are not as horrific as conservatives make them.
As for Mr. Bean, no one has died or been downright deceived.
And the cure, painful as it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: reliable, solid, and slightly brutal government.
The latest fuss about political donations is a good example.
Garboid Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to charity, says he didn't want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision was not up to him.
The laws against the anonymity of large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has a right to know who might be buying access to those who govern the country.
Mr Watt, who said that he knew of Mr Abrahams' procedure but did not know that it was illegal, will certainly be questioned thoroughly; so did Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main fundraiser, who learned of the tricky donations in October.
But so far, Mr. Brown is not involved; There is nothing to suggest that he knew about these plots, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He was very quick to condemn this violation of the law by his own party, but he diluted his resolve by resorting to a tried-and-true instrument, a commission to investigate the matter—headed by a retired bishop and judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been broken, it is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has had none for six months, and moving forward with real reform of party funding.
That would require Labour, which is in dire straits, to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps even give up their special financial relationship with the unions - a bitter pill for a stalwart party member like Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
The Conservatives now have a decent lead in the polls; He has two years to win back voters; And the only way to win is unassailable integrity and high competence.
Card sharks
Is the subprime crisis affecting the US credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, the dorsal fins naturally begin to flicker excitedly.
Now that America's housing market is languishing, predators have targeted the credit card market there.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs say credit card losses could reach $99 billion if other consumer credit options were infected from subprime mortgages.
Signs of tension are clear.
The number of cases of inability to repay (with a delay of more than 30 days in payment) and debited accounts (accounts that the provider considers unenforceable) is increasing.
HSBC said last month it had lost $1.4 billion in the U.S. consumer credit market — also due to insolvent credit card loans.
But it is too early to panic.
Bills written off and inability to repay are still few.
According to Moody's, the 3.89% insolvency rate in the third quarter was almost a full percentage point below average.
The deteriorating rates can partly be explained by technical reasons.
A change in the U.S. personal bankruptcy laws of 2005 has led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcies, which account for a large portion of credit card losses; Thus, the number of reports (and thus the number of write-offs) would increase regardless of whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorated.
The industry also shows a good maturity rate, which shows how much consumers repay monthly on their debt.
And confidence in securities secured by credit cards is solid, despite paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of research firm TowerGroup predicts that their emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct paths for contagion between the sub-prime crisis and the credit-card market: when equity loans dry up, consumers are more likely to take on credit card debt.
But credit card issuers look more at cash flow than the value of collateral, so falling home prices do not necessarily mean a change in borrowers' trustworthiness.
They can even be beneficial for lenders.
Consumers' incentive to repay their mortgages decreases when the value of their property falls below the value of the loan; As a result, the debt on the cards moves up the list of priorities to repay.
Card issuers can also respond more quickly and flexibly to more turbulent conditions than mortgage lenders by changing interest rates or debt limits.
In theory, this should reduce the risks of rapid changes in the prices of guarantee items.
"It's not going to happen that we just rethink all the loans one fine morning," says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
While the risk of a sub-prime mortgage-style explosion is low, the danger of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower home prices and debt reduction push America into recession, the credit card industry faces a darker future.
Watch out for those dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were due to be tried for their roles in fraud linked to former Enron financial executive Andrew Fastow changed their testimony on Wednesday and pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially denied guilt in seven fraud charges in which he and Fastow were alleged to have participated in financial fraud in 2000 -- to enrich themselves at the expense of their employers.
They were due to appear in court in January.
But during the trial before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each pleaded guilty to one fraud.
The case of the three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, made headlines throughout the two years of extradition proceedings.
In the United States, their case is one of the pending parts of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
The allegations against them in 2002 alerted Mr. Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation into the collapse of Enron.
The indictment against the bankers -- who have earned the nickname "NatWest Three" -- alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to plot a fraud with Fastow and his former senior aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in a partner subsidiary of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a host of Enron's scams that pushed Enron in a spiral toward bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank valued its stake in this branch at zero, but our three Britons knew that it was in fact worth considerably.
The company, under Kopper's control, bought the bank's stake in the branch for $1 million.
The bankers in question paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million for its stake in Greenwich NatWest.
But the $20 million actually went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, according to the indictment, and Fastow, Kopper and others received about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence at a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence at a facility in Texarkana.
All three Britons were at large on $1 million bail, which ordered them to remain in the United States for an upcoming trial.
Enron, once the country's seventh-largest company, collapsed in December 2001 after years of accounting trickery made it impossible to hide billions in debt or report failed speculation as profitable.
The collapse has cut thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value, and more than $2 billion in retirement.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the company's downfall.
Skilling is serving more than twenty-four years in prison.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were swept away after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's Non-Helplessness
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel for a nonstop flight from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of Russia's wealthy, however, they are pennies to return.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"But none of them are interested in that many jobs because it's for a close family or a corporate president."
Mr. Firer sat in a Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaires Show, a four-day of conspicuous consumerism at a mammoth exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers set up their stands, hoping to lure newly wealthy Russians with everything from mahogany-inlaid yachts to diamond-decorated car bulkheads they wouldn't be ashamed of for 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looked cautiously at the bright orange Porsche in the next stall.
"That's a nice car, but against us it's dimes and dimes," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private jet market."
On the waves of oil, money is pouring into the Russian capital just as much as when Dallas had its days.
"We went through the same stage in the '80s when some Americans got enormously rich and went to Europe, where they were seen as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year student at Harvard's Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.
Like the Saudi spendthrifters of the '70s and the Japanese of the '90s, the Russians are becoming the world's most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in this Klondike.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a luxury industry conference brought in Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of the LVMH Group, to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets like Russia's.
(The conference is hosted by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires with a total fortune of $282 billion, according to Forbes magazine's list of the richest people.
In addition, the local main institute in the field Center for Economic and Financial Research has published a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 "second-rate" millionaires in Russia, whose combined fortune is $ 670 billion.
(The World Bank reports that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative at London-based jewellery store David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All the women are impeccably groomed, and the men are each for a fortune."
As they walked through the halls in evening dresses on Sunday evening, twenty-one-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and Svetlana Turovtsova, five years her senior, branded themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I've been looking at the cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Miss Yumatova, who dressed in designer clothes like a red carpet veteran that makes Joan Rivers look like a housewife.
The fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the nouveau riche, brand-driven Russian buyers who are willing to sit for a few hours in traffic to stroll around a warehouse that garishly mixes Cadillac Escalade, platinum fish, Mövenpick ice cream, custom-made billiard tables, Dubai apartments, Gund stuffed animals and draughts.
Members of the general public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the booth of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before reproducing Rembrandt's larger-than-life painting from hand-painted blue tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in glitter."
Indeed, the vendors here say that Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old by Russian standards) have moved from shiny logos to little-known limited-edition brands that would never show up at a shopping fair.
Even so, several thousand people, whether millionaires, millionaires' ambassadors or simple tourists, flooded the exhibition halls every day.
And some of them were buying.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil beds, said he had sold two mattress sets of silk, cashmere and cotton, interwoven with gold threads, for $70,000 each.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarms, said his company had sold a bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a custom-made luxury car company, said he had sold three car grilles in the style of interconnected chain bracelets for Rolls-Royce Phantoms for $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter the wheel of a car designed for a Russian casino owner that had a string coated with Swarovski crystals so that it looked like roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four such.
"That Russian millionaire who wants ostrich-skin bikes or a portrait of his wife made of cubic zirconium doesn't have to ride those bikes yet," Mr. Karapetian said.
"He stores them in his garage of thirty to forty cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaire" doesn't mean anything exclusive these days, given the big rise in property prices here.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least pretend to be wealthy at a booth run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management firm.
The company erected four red British-style phone booths stuffed with columns of fake million-dollar banknotes.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the Millionaires Fair.
Passersby stopped to throw around piles of money, or to be photographed by friends on their cell phones relaxing in the midst of substitute wealth, or simply to stuff their pockets with a few million.
"You know, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Death in New Jersey possibly caused by a spoiled operation
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out of the large windows of the local A Slightly Healthier restaurant and watched the ambulance pull up to a white New England house two houses down West Scott Avenue.
Soon a police patrol car joined.
And then another.
"Then I saw the forensic doctor's van arrive," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant inspector.
"At that moment, I knew someone had died."
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, an executive assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now, investigators are trying to determine whether she died because of a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity police have refused to disclose, who worked at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have yet to determine what caused Miss Arroyo's death and hope toxicology tests, the results of which may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that sent a wave of grief into Newark police leadership.
Miss Arroy had been an assistant to the Chief of Police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tenacious and worked hard," Mr. McCarthy said of Miss Arroy in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
It would protect me."
Mr McCarthy said Miss Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that she leaves behind two sons, aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine if Miss Arroyo died as a result of an unlicensed surgery.
"It's an option," Miss Walsh said.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about three o'clock in the afternoon on the 21st.
November and found Miss Arroy on the sofa.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week later, authorities have still said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, who is believed to be Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh did not say whether the authorities had questioned Ms. Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as a doctor's office.
On Wednesday at Miss Castro's house, with a damaged rose bush in the front garden and a Dalmatian barking in the back, no one answered
Next to the door that led to the basement sat a blue barrel in an open garage with the words "Ethyl Vanillin" — a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
Two mountain bikes hung on hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Miss Arroy had provided him with invaluable assistance in navigating the intolerant and harsh political culture of his new town.
"She said, 'You should watch out for this or that,'" he said.
"She was always there when I came and she was always there when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hope that the Fed will cut interest rates leads to a strengthening of world stock markets
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after market hopes that the Federal Reserve would try to ease lending conditions by further interest rate cuts were boosted by reassuring remarks from the US Federal Reserve vice-chairman.
Stocks jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second only to Ben Bernanke, the Fed's chairman, said executives needed to be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to ongoing pressure in financial markets.
In an apparent effort to calm irritated markets amid signs of revived credit strain, Mr Kohn said the recent turmoil "partly reversed some improvements in market functioning in late September and October."
He said that if increased volatility persists, the possibility that financial conditions of households and firms will deteriorate further will increase.
Investors see these statements as a signal that the Fed is ready to inject more fresh doses of capital into U.S. markets, and possibly further interest rate cuts to stabilize credit conditions.
The remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid more bad news about the U.S. economy, with apartment sales posting record lows in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were underscored by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it would cut 650 jobs, or 4% of its global workforce, as part of cost-cutting to compensate for heavy losses caused by a failed bet on sub-prime home loans in America.
Only 20 of those jobs are expected to be closed in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the better-used S&P 500 rose 2.65 percent.
London's FTSE 100 rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, with the value of British blue-chips rising by more than £39 billion.
Germany's Dax index rose 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 rose 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit tensions in the markets were in full force when, in an auction of the European Central Bank's three-month money packages, these funds were lent to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and ECB and dump extra money on London's money markets has increased, with rates on Britain's three-month "Libor" interbank loans rising to their highest since late September of 6.59 percent after an uninterrupted rise since November 12.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be the number six at bat for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context, no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who is to make that decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, chairman of the selection committee, who is at best in borrowed time, is supposed to help Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with the decision, and because the table of Hugh Morris, the England team's chief manager, is starting to fill up with applications for the post of national collector, though not necessarily full-time.
Whoever is not put in sixth place at bat will be unhappy, but life is often not fair, and sport certainly is not.
It is not easy to find what will get one to the top of his profession, while someone else will never get through a lower level, sometimes due to lack of luck rather than ability.
Not only in cricket is the selection challenging and requires a judgement, which in the end must always be subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
Is that fair to Shah, isn't it?
We could ask the same question in another area, let's say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with a good education and insight into the field, should be promoted to the commission - there is only a place for one.
Who's to say which level is right for a cricketer if he doesn't have a chance to drop or swim to the next one?
Naturally, numbers have a big impact on decision-making, but so do opportunities.
In a team, the cricketer must catch the captain's gaze at the right time if he should take the wicket, and the batter needs regular chances in the starting positions if he is ever to make an impression as a day cricketer.
Capturing the collector's gaze is more complicated.
Last season, for example, there were many better than James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems assured, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitched like an artilleryman.
Anderson took 32 wickets in first class with 33 runs each.
Chris Tremlett took just 29 at an equally meager average, but both had their moments at the highest level and are hoping for more.
Whether he will play at the Asgiriya Shah or Bopar Stadium may only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can start or finish the careers of both, or it may not have a big impact.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and performed well in first class, five wickets and 40 allowed runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was fighting for his place at the same time, who eventually became a stable Test Cricketer, who is extra, despite scoring twice a hundred points in Australia against Australia,  perhaps still underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more discussion following today's practice at Asirgiya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah's greater experience to Bopar's youthful exuberance.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88-point test innings in Mumbai and 32 first-class innings speak for Shah, compared to six Bopar, who, at twenty-two, is seven years younger and has excellent stats against spin pitching.
But Shah made just ten runs in two innings in May against the Caribbean at the Lord's Test, his home ground in Middlesex, and that, along with the immediate rejection of the collectors when Vaughan wanted to re-fill him for the next game, his batting seemed to take away some of the momentum that was so evident in Mumbai.
The Essex universal, on the other hand, has a joie de vivre in his bones.
Nothing scares him on the cricket pitch and his behaviour off the pitch is symbolised by a recently overturned four-wheel drive car on the exhibition day of the English team's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He escaped with minor injuries and probably shock, but the first thing he did was pull out his Vodafone (also sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was watching from a distance, to ask him excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, delivering his medium-speed shear pitches on the pitches here that seem to suit him, efficiently and batting with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps this is the real art of selection.
Personally, I'm leaning towards Bopara getting his chance now, which is not to say that Shah won't excel if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he's the one playing here next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, emptying refugees who had run out of money or expired visas, and others who had hoped the city was returning to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the militants who had driven them from their homes.
Mansoor's bus station was already full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubaysi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read about in the newspapers, because of what happened in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militia of militant cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has temporarily ordered his people to stop fighting.
Qassem al-Atwani, a thirty-eight-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni region of Amariya, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visas and because the regime there did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariya called him to say that local militias, with the support of the U.S. military, had helped push al-Qaeda out of their positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe driven from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He returned to fight.
"The day before yesterday, some friends called me and told me that they were starting an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many spoke of the appeal of appeasement in the capital after the buildup of the U.S. military presence and the growth of local "groups of interested citizens" who are taking arms alongside the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But more was said to have been driven to return by visa obstruction and money cuts in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a fifty-one-year-old father of three, voiced suspicions shared among refugees that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people have fled Iraqi sectarian murderers.
"Everything was fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and pressed the government to stop giving Iraqis visas so they would have to go back to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the reduction in violence is that Sunnis have been pushed out of Shia areas and vice versa, which is reducing tensions in many places.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and lead to another struggle.
Tiny Saarland, good education
Germany's smallest federal state plays a leading role in vocational education, excelling even with the international focus of its universities.
In only one area of education, the Saarland is as concerned about the lack of shortages as the rest of Germany.
"Yesterday I explained to a person who does not come from the Saarland for the fiftieth time that we are no French" - this self-deprecating slogan appears on posters in the Saarland on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birthday of this smallest federal state.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which ranks fifth in the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW) education monitoring.
Traditionally, universities cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To this day, students can finish their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
This corresponds to a reasonably high share of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, an above-average number of Saarland children are admitted to college - many of them without attending grammar school.
"In Saarland, a vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, IW's education expert.
With more than one in five young people eligible to study at a vocational school, Saarland is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, Saarland offers ample opportunities to combine practical and academic education.
The possibilities to study two subjects are the second best in Germany in terms of population.
Despite practice-oriented education and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates has dropped by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now ordered universities to create a promotional campaign for engineering disciplines.
"After the first Pisa study, we have implemented several reforms in general education schools," says a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
The government has therefore introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start learning as early as possible, the last year of nursery school is free of charge - a model that is also being adopted by other federal states.
Whether pupils' results will improve significantly will only be revealed in future comparative studies.
In the 2003 Pisa study, the proportion of at-risk pupils had fallen from 29 to 20 %.
Overall, however, the Saarland has not improved as much as other Länder.
Bavarians are better at counting.
And to Saarland's disappointment, Pisa studies do not compare foreign language skills - otherwise Saarland could score points in this area.
The language of neighbours is compulsory in grammar schools – even if the inhabitants of the Saarland are not French.
Chavez shifts the clock
Soon, classes in Venezuela will go differently than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will set the clock back half an hour in the South American country.
In Spain, meanwhile, Chávez is becoming a ridiculous figurehead.
The official newspaper of Venezuela reported that the clock will shift by minus four and a half hours compared to world time under the new law.
The South American state will be taking this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chávez, an enemy of the United States, justified his decision by, among other things, the fact that the United States had imposed time zones on the world by hours.
On Wednesday local time, Chavez announced that he was severing relations with neighboring Colombia because of the hostage case.
The left-wing nationalist has said that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with him or the Colombian government.
"I can't because of my self-respect," said Chavez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the oil country's citizens must vote on in Sunday's referendum.
With this reform, Chávez would greatly strengthen his power in the country.
The row was sparked by Uribe's decision to revoke Chavez's mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia for the release of the hostages.
Uribe "spat in Venezuela's face" with his decision, Chavez criticized Uribe on Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone is talking about Chávez.
A new mobile ringtone has caused a stir: "Por qué no te callas" (Why aren't you quiet anymore?) – a phrase that more than half a million people have downloaded from the internet.
It was uttered by Spain's King Juan Carlos, who, at the recent Ibero-American summit, was so angered by the left-wing populist's loud remarks that he silenced him in this way.
Germans face lower payouts in 2007
According to the forecast, German employees are at risk of a reduction in real wages this year despite the strong boom.
Experts justified their pessimistic forecast for a number of reasons.
According to estimates by the Hans Böckler Foundation, employed people in 2007 can realistically count on receiving a lower wage than last year.
"Small increases in salaries, increases in value-added tax and increases in food and energy prices are to blame," Gustav Horn of the IMK (Institut für Makroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung) research institute told Bild.
New burdens may also await employees in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung newspaper that the planned reduction in unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% for the new year was correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency would not again be allowed to fall into such difficulties as to have to demand loans or contributions from the youth of the Federal Army, the newspaper quoted the Social Democrat politician as saying.
On Tuesday, it was revealed that the price explosion of food and petroleum products had driven inflation to its highest level in thirteen years.
In an annual comparison, prices increased by three percent overall.
Venus is the hellish twin of Earth
Despite its life-hostile atmosphere, Venus is more Earth-like than previously thought. Europe's Venus Express spacecraft on Venus has recorded phenomena that occur on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and wind vortices at the poles.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that Venus is lightning.
Now the European probe Venus Express has produced proof - it has picked up electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. Lightning flies from cloud to cloud on Venus at an altitude of about 56 kilometers, writes Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the scientific journal Nature.
According to the well-known theory of the origin of primordial matter, life could have arisen on Earth thanks to lightning. Storms supposedly triggered reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstones of life.
That wasn't the case on Venus: "If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, anything alive would hardly be found on the surface of Venus. The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and sometimes temperatures are around 500 degrees Celsius.
"Venus may be Earth's hellish twin, but it's a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, began to evolve completely differently is a fundamental question for ESA's mission.
Since no probe has been sent since the early 90s solely to study Venus, the launch of Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in the exploration of this planet.
According to scientists, the latest results of the research, which were presented in several articles in the journal Nature, did not only emphasize the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more similar to Earth than previously thought," Esa said.
In addition to the already known wind vortices at the North Pole, scientists have found a cloud vortex at the South Pole that spins significantly faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in Earth's northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of Italy's Instituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in our solar system is almost the same mass as Earth, and with a diameter of 12,100 km, it is almost the same size.
This planet, known as the Morning Star or Evening Star, orbits the Sun in nearly 225 days.
However, it rotates much more slowly around its own axis. One day on Venus lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with a surface temperature of 460 °C and a pressure of 92 bar(short for bar?) It does not resemble Earth, scientists assume that the two planets formed under very similar conditions.
Water accumulated on both of them. On Earth, however, it remained in the oceans, while from Venus it evaporated into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates, on Venus it makes up most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to party disputes over the reception of the Dalai Lama as chancellor.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after a meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and is calling on the grand coalition to end the controversy over receiving the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present ourselves externally as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler told the economic newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed understanding for the decision of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to receive the Dalai Lama in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me," Köhler said.
While the Federal President stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, that did not prevent him from standing up for Merkel when she was accused of creating a new policy towards China.
"The Federal Chancellor has not abandoned the traditional one-China policy.
China knows this too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his opposition to receiving the Dalai Lama and was attacked by the coalition over it.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the coalition's "showcase" foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lama as chancellor, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only has the Chinese government cancelled the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to SPIEGEL, it has also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of the two countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that receiving the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve of European politicians officially accepting a Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China's position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas also located on Chinese territory, is trying to separate from China.
Schäuble warns of similar riots that have broken out in France
Street fights with police, shootings, burning cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar riots that have broken out in France.
We must do everything we can to prevent social discontent in Germany from turning violent on the streets, urges the Federal Minister of the Interior.
The barricades were burning, the rioters were firing shotguns at the police. After severe juvenile riots in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We have to be careful not to create such social tensions in our country that erupt into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told Hanover's Neue Presse newspaper.
Not every young person is able to cope with the rapid change in social reality.
The federal government, states and municipalities are already working hard to eliminate the problems, Schäuble said.
Which doesn't just mean the integration of migrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Islam Conference, we are seeing the first successes."
However, caution is still in order.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of France.
In recent nights, juveniles have fought fierce street battles with police in the northern suburbs of Paris.
Even in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were burned.
Greater integration efforts by the German government were demanded by the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Referring to the unrest in France, Kolat warned of an "imitative effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, action should be taken.
Kolat pointed out that among people under 25 who come from a migrant background, the unemployment rate is "above average."
Above all, more learning opportunities must be ensured.
Kolat stressed: "We must give hope to the youth."
However, the chairman of the Turkish municipality added that in Germany, unlike in France, there is greater social control of families.
In addition, many teenagers from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat admonished, "Still, we have to be careful."
We need to "quickly enable young people to start working and educating themselves."
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel remained largely quiet.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed and a helicopter with searchlights flew over the area.
Authorized authorities reported three arrests and several burning trash cans and cars.
Since yesterday, around 1,000 deployed riot police have been taking care of the peace.
Police will intervene for as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
About 80 police officers were injured in riots on the outskirts of Villiers-le-Bel overnight on Tuesday.
The following night, riots engulfed Toulouse.
The disorder was sparked by a traffic accident on Sunday in which two teenagers lost their lives.
According to the initial findings of the public prosecutor's office, the police are not to blame for the deaths of the juveniles.
In the realm of Angela "Clouds"
The Chancellor's distant output documents that the coalition is programmatically at an end and that we can expect nothing more from herself.
What kind of country does this Chancellor actually live in?
After her bleak, indifferent-sounding and poor speech at the general debate of the Bundestag, we must say: not here - not in this country, which she should be governing, after all.
Angela Merkel responded to the accusation of concentrating too much on foreign policy with one very arrogant sentence.
That's parochial, she said, showing she doesn't want to understand what the critics are up to.
In the Bundestag, she visibly demonstrated to everyone how much she deserved the reproach.
There was no real interest in Merkel, let alone a sense of the country's problems.
Instead, Angela "Cloud" presented herself: a politician who stands out above the rest, who flees into foreign policy and even there expresses herself only vaguely.
For example, climate protection: it is constantly praised for the conclusions of the Heiligendamm summit, but no longer says how the climate targets are to be achieved in Germany.
And in general, such self-praise - so much immodesty the CDU leader would have forgiven herself just two years ago.
Now she limits herself to empty phrases that could increase her popularity among people.
With this approach, she damages her image of a pragmatist who does not need flattery because she solves problems.
But in the realm of Angela "Cloud," internal political problems are a marginal issue.
Child poverty and the worries of low-wage earners?
A few subordinate clauses on these topics remained for her.
It is noteworthy how often Merkel is said when it comes to child benefits.
Three times, Merkel has to start from the beginning in order to pronounce at least partially the correct sentence.
As soon as things get too concrete, he stumbles like in completely foreign terrain.
Department Attack
The debate between the Republican presidential candidates on YouTube has erupted into a heated debate for the favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney - and both now have to worry about the outsider candidate.
The tension of the two candidates is already evident in the first topic.
Mitt Romney is accusing his rival Rudy Guilian of turning New York into a "haven for illegal immigrants."
Giuliani is quick to respond with sharp reproaches: "I think his own house was just one such refuge," he replies, suggesting to the former Massachusetts governor that he privately employed undocumented immigrants.
Candidates go on the offensive. With the Republican base yet without a clear favorite, eight presidential candidates are using these debates on CNN mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute videos filmed by Internet users and sent via Youtube serve only as such hints for the key topic.
"This is precisely the kind of isolationist policy that allowed Hitler to seize power," John McCain said of his rival, Ron Paul, who is the only one advocating an immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnam veteran McCain does not spare Romney for refusing to condemn a torturous interrogation method called "Waterboarding," in which drowning is simulated.
The reaction of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, shows that neither the war in Iraq nor the methods of torture are important campaign themes.
The audience erupts in applause whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases rejected.
This will show where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
"I was wrong then," Romney explains contritely, asking the party's base and television audiences for forgiveness for being a proponent of abortion as recently as 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to comment on a literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules in civilian clothes for the first time
The day after stepping down as commander-in-chief of the army, Pakistan's ruler, Musharraf, was sworn in as president.
This marks the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in as president on Thursday and will remain in office for another five years.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony, which took place at the presidential palace in the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to uphold the constitution and work for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his office as commander-in-chief to his confidant, Ashfaq Kiyani, in a move to international pressure, particularly from the US.
Eight years after seizing power in a bloodless military coup, a former general is ruling as a civilian head of state for the first time.
By stepping down as commander-in-chief, Musharraf has fulfilled one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is the lifting of the state of emergency that Musharraf declared on November 3.
According to Attorney General Malik Mohammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency soon after being sworn in, fulfilling another of the West's demands.
The country's highest court, which Musharraf had appointed with lawyers sympathetic to him after declaring a state of emergency in early November, last week rejected all objections to the disputed re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others wounded in an attack on a military convoy in the North Waziristan tribal region.
An army spokesman said the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of krautrock return
The famous German band of the seventies plays again. Three members of Harmonia recaptured their electronic synthesizers at a concert in Berlin.
The revival will also include Live 1974, a montage of the band's most successful period.
Even back then they were much better known abroad.
The announced sensation then consists of the performance of three sedentary gentlemen, who at first look as if they were just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables and especially buttons in front of them.
Sixty-three-year-old Dieter Moebius in a snow-white shirt sits in the middle.
To his left is fifty-seven-year-old Michael Rother, with a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
Seventy-three-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who is intently bent over the synthesizers, is on the right from the audience's point of view.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, surely by accident, a traditional composition is created.
It seems that the musicians do not mind too much.
Among krautrock lovers, the revival of the band Harmonia caused quite a stir.
One thing is worth noting here. Repeated questions have shown that while this name is part of the collective pop consciousness, it is certainly not so established that this band has been sorely missed for twenty-three years.
But why can't a German celebrate his still-living legends from the seventies?
Especially when the musical style, mistakenly called krautrock, is valued more in England and America than in their own country.
When in 2003 the music business awarded the surviving members of the Cologne band Can the Echo Award for life's work, the hall was full of questioning glances from German pop fans.
Moreover, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu! during their speeches, the astonishment of the audience knew no bounds.
Michael Rother later sat on stage with them at Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts like an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and adoration abroad is one thing.
Remembering the band Harmonia unnecessarily overloads our memory, this trio existed for only two years and even then it did not have nearly as much influence as others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the cellar of Berlin's Schaubühne Theater.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons at a record company run by the church.
Rother briefly helped out with Kraftwerk, but gained a reputation as a guitarist for Neu!, perhaps Germany's most radical band at the time.
In 1973, Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of a commune who had fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to toil as a nanny.
It was more like a life in a kind of Spitzwegian artistic being.
The name for the art is allegedly derived from the name of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was allegedly found in a garbage can.
Much of this has been preserved by Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music from Harmonie" and the following "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered from financial difficulties.
Collecting grates was not just about self-knowledge.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was reportedly edited in front of a record-breaking small, barely fifty-member backdrop during a concert in Griessem.
At the time, Rothera expressed a desire for the members of Harmony to exercise and exercise occasionally.
For Roedlius and Moebius this was a completely indecent request.
In 1975, the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up in the esoteric realm and secured his future with the album "Burning Heart".
The band Cluster was revived in the eighties and since then it has been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for the live album from Griessemer.
His record label, Grönland, set out to cherish krautrock as an original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! Roedelius' solo work was considered to be at the time.
The bodily resurrection of Harmony will take place in Berlin's House of World Cultures.
Woldtronics performances will be publicly sponsored.
Present will be Brit, Julian Cope, an old punk and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
The founder of the Love Parade, Dr. Motte, will also attend.
With this we have outlined the overall breadth of krautrock's influence on future pop music.
The empty space of the famous group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's sentence, accompanied by the strangest sounds, floats in the hall: "Unique real music, the future belongs to it."
There are paintings in which the producer is with Harmony in a peasant sitting room.
The projection of other black-and-white photographs in which the set of instruments is wildly connected by cables also contributes to the creation of the legend.
Before that, the three veterans are again busy improvisation.
No longer by gluing microphones to organs and drums to extract those never-heard self-made tones from the instruments.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three tech-savvy nitpickers.
The choir of the House of World Cultures does not change this.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, whispers are whispered under the clouds of sound, and in one beautiful place "Aaaa!" is emphaticly sung.
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never rock.
Rather than blues, roots can be found in music colleges (Can), technology (Kraftwerk) or escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever shouts "'68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but even now Harmonia will not be disturbed.
Even the most obvious things are thought through on stage.
Where does music begin and when does it end?
This question either takes one's nerves or allows one to experience fleeting moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough
With the release of The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two films about the war in the Balkans appeared.
But neither is convincing.
The original films either place too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too moving.
Not even an actor like Richard Gere can prevent this in The Hunting Party.
The good news first: War criminals Karadzic and Mladic may still be hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it's there, in the grim backdrop of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere finds himself.
Lately, we have lost sight of this most beautiful man of the eighties, not only because he starred in many nice, non-serious roles in cool women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences forever on the subject of Buddhism, one gets the taste for another movie with this actor.
And yet, Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party (Why do movie titles have to be so long and tangled these days?).
Gere gives a magical performance. His war reporter, Simon Hunt, is essentially what Gere might have become if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful: a man who, though long past his prime, still retains a remarkable charm as a ruin-like memorial.
But despite this trump card, The Hunting Party, along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also hits theaters this week, is just a continuation of an endless series of failed films about the war in the Balkans.
With Mörderischer Frieden, we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, whereupon one of them falls in love with her.
While it's commendable that Serbs aren't presented as the cause of all evil, this shallow TV movie turns into shooting and action too soon.
The film will remain something very similar to the Cobra 11 series, albeit without the highway, but with war.
The Hunting Party illustrates why we haven't been able to make a really good film about the Balkan War.
The story of three American war reporters who set out to find "The Fox", Serbia's top war criminal, could possibly become a new "Apocalypse" in a different time and under the guidance of a different director and screenwriter (both of whom are Richard Shepard).
After all, the two stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go into the forest to do something the army is incapable of, but their journey becomes a road to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the debauched and sentimental cynic introduced at the beginning.
On the contrary, the novel also prescribes a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim woman.
We can finally write off The Hunting Party after reporters in the film's last five fast-paced minutes do what NATO, the CIA, and all the world's criminal hunters have failed to do over the past five years: catch the criminal and leave him to the just revenge of the Bosnian Muslims.
This is so against the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth turning to the International Court in The Hague.
Yet this film has a deeply human message.
He denounces the fact that Karadzic and Mladić are still at large, and suspects the Americans and the French (here they are exceptionally united) that they are not pursuing persecution intensively enough through secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, women think of Brecht's famous poem.
In it, it is a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer's desk: "I look with compassion at the swollen veins on my forehead, remarked: how laborious it is to be evil."
Movies like The Hunting Party feature exactly the kind of swollen heads, but they hint at how strenuous it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the subject of the war in the Balkans.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all Hollywood films about Iraq were major failures.
The only thing that can be added to this is that no good film about South Africa has ever been made.
It's almost always true: When a star wanders around a crisis area or walks in a minefield, a movie like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, Breaking Line with Angelina Jolie, or Blutdiamanten with Leonardo DiCaprio is made.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it took decades before Hollywood could make a good Holocaust movie — Schindler's List.
Many films seem to have matured - films that are now considered classic Vietnamese works - "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse" or "Lead Vest" - were in no way hailed as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home immediately appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Screenwriters don't have the skills needed to tell good stories flawlessly.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" became so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terribly the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you can't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps he needs to form a sarcastically reserved artistic view like novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and "The Balkan War", he said: "The only thing that is similar is that some things never change.
The cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and there will always be a war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust draws criticism for cancelling the Olympics
The mayor's withdrawal from the Hamburg Summer Olympics has been met with fierce criticism of politics and economics.
Many want to fight further to organize games by the water.
But von Beust urges realism in estimating chances.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, on Wednesday described the decision "from a business point of view" as unfortunate.
No other project has recently awakened such great motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, it would not have been possible to maintain this sporting and political enthusiasm to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "based on a changed timetable."
Mayor Ole von Beust on Wednesday stuck to his earlier statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Federation will decide on the Olympic candidacy," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December, the Sports Federation will decide on Munich's candidacy for the 2018 Winter Games.
"This preference means for us that with a 2028 timetable, we have no realistic chance."
Yet that dream is not over, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) called von Beust's remarks regrettable.
It gives the impression that Hamburg does not want to bid to host the Olympic Games in the next twenty-five years.
"It is too early to ruin our chances by declaring the plans buried at this early stage," HSB President Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
To renounce the bid would contradict the testimony of the head of the Senate at the general meeting of the General German University Sports Association.
Von Beust did not announce Hamburg's candidacy for the 2015 Universiade as a replacement for hosting the Olympics.
The Hamburg University Sports Association only last week nominated it as a candidate city.
The SPD faction in Hamburg's parliament reproached the Senate for wasting valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area has been hampered for years by the Senate because it bet on hosting the Olympics and ruled out the construction of apartments," SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD was still planning the Olympics for the Klein Grasbrook area, with the whole area to be used for housing purposes later, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor".
Bidding for the 2012 Summer Olympics generated great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
But Hamburg was shipwrecked at Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes
Anyone who connects Sweden and wooden boxes is not thinking of Andy Warhol, but of Ikea.
Or is it?
Wooden boxes currently produced in Sweden cast dark shadows on the list of Warhol's work.
Most of his listed ninety-four Stockholm brillo boxes are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago expressed doubts about the authenticity of Warhol's 1968 "Brillo Boxes", internal research by the Moderna Museet in Stockholm has produced a disappointing result; The six "Brillo boxes" donated to the Moderna Museet in 1995 by its former director, Pontus Hultén, are copies – as are most of the other Stockholm-type Brillo boxes in circulation on the international art market.
Previous events are a tangled, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painting wooden boxes that were based on the red-blue-and-white design of paper boxes of Brillo soap powder.
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 showcased - with Warhol's permission - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard. These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were supplied directly from the Brillo factory.
These were not works of art, but their models, mere exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 for several wooden Brillo crates to be made in Sweden, but these are not on display at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of that time now speak of fifteen boxes, which at that time rightfully entered art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes" marked Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned off for more than $100,000.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the museum, Pontus Hultén, later falsely claimed that in 1968 around a hundred crates were made and displayed in Sweden, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, 105 Hultén crates were made in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg only in 1990.
By then, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator of the Moderna Museet, examined in addition to the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, three Brillo boxes from a Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and painted with oil white paint after their plywood boards were painted with a brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies revealed that the paint was applied without a previous primer by a painter's roll directly to the plywood board - besides, it is acrylic and not oil paint.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo box list," said Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet: "Unless the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York comes to different conclusions, the Moderna Museet will have to classify six crates from its exhibition collections as 'exhibition material - copies.'"
In July, the Authentication Board announced that it would look into the "core allegations" in the soap powder box case.
But the organization has so far remained relentlessly silent.
Rebel soldiers in Manila surrender
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila surrendered and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Rebel commander Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of manipulation and corruption in the election, told reporters at the hotel that he denied responsibility for the bloodshed.
Earlier, soldiers loyal to the government attacked the hotel with tear gas.
A few hours earlier, about two dozen soldiers had fortified themselves in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them were on trial for a foiled 2003 coup attempt, including Trillanes.
He used the negotiations to flee with about 30 sympathizers.
The military policemen who were supposed to guard him apparently defected to his side and joined the rebellion.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Forces loyal to the government cordoned off the area around the selected hotel.
The president called an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers' actions.
"People have had enough," Triallnes said.
"We invite people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite Scout Rangers unit, said other military units would join the march shortly.
Critics of the government have called for large demonstrations against the president on Friday.
For months, her government has been accused of corruption.
Manila's financial region became the main scene of a 2003 revolt by about 200 soldiers against Arroyo.
Because the army refused to join the rebels, the rebellion failed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, they have tried at least seven times to overthrow a democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes the majority shareholder of Versatel
United Internet has secured a more than twenty percent stake in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The company announced on Wednesday that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
The company now owns 20.05% of the share capital.
Previously, there was speculation about a takeover.
The company is still counting on the possibility of further increasing its stake in Versatel.
United Internet said it was looking to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After Berenberg increased its stake in the Düsseldorf-based network operator by a further 5% to 15.1%, there was talk of an entry on Wednesday.
It is said in the financial market that this financial institution holds shares only for a third party.
Yesterday, United Internet already had a nearly 10% stake in Drillisch, a mobile telecommunications network provider.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch has put up for sale a further 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
Of these, 5.15 million shares were bought by United Internet for €31.4 million.
The companies discussed marketing cooperation in the area of DSL products and mobile networks.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesperson explained.
In order to take over the competitor freenet, the companies together set up a joint venture of SMEs.
United Internet announced on Thursday that the two companies would settle for a stake of more than 10% in Freenet for the time being and would not exercise their right to take over another 18.49% of the business.
It is considered that the companies are still keeping all options open, in particular the possibility of further increasing their stake in Freenet AG.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
This months-long and hardly transparent freenet game is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile network contract customers and 1.27 million full or DSL customers at the end of the third quarter.
The holding of United Internet and Drillische previously held a 6.01% stake in Freenet.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will get approximately another 4%.
The right to buy 18.49% of the investment company Vatas was agreed in August.
