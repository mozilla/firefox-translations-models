Novák helped Trabzonspor to second place, Škoda also scored
Defender Filip Novák helped Trabzonspor to the title of vice-champion with a goal in the last round of the Turkish football league.
His team won 2-1 at Kayserispor and held off third-placed Besiktas.
Attacker Milan Škoda scored the tenth goal for Rizespor after his transfer from Slavia in January, who saved themselves, even though they lost 1:3 at Fenerbahce.
Novák confirmed the defender&#39;s excellent productivity with his seventh goal in this league year.
In the 63rd minute, the goalkeeper of Kayserispor just hit a sharp shot and the Czech footballer fired the ball into the net from an angle.
The home side managed to equalize with five minutes to go, but Trabzonspor grabbed victory in the sixth minute of regulation when they successfully finished off a four-on-one break.
In the beginning of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce, Škoda tied the score at 1:1 after a solo.
Although Rizespor did not maintain a draw for long, it did not have to be a regret, as thanks to the results of its opponents, it remained three points above the relegation zone.
The competition will end with the Sunday duel of the champion Basaksehir on the field of Kasimpasa.
The well-hidden Hermit&#39;s Cave in the woods near Nové Bor was not actually habitable
In the north of Bohemia in the foothills of the Lužické Mountains, near Nový Bor in Českolipsk, in the forests through which the Hraběcí cesta led, several sandstone rock formations are hidden.
Natural and man-made.
And we go after the man-made.
The place is called the Hermit&#39;s Cave.
In reality, however, no hermit ever lived here and the cave served as a shelter, or rather a shelter chamber, apparently for grain.
The cave is carved out of the side of a rocky promontory and is accessible by stairs from above.
At the same time, it is practically invisible until the last moment.
It is only revealed by the narrow steps leading to a kind of rock gallery, from where you can only enter the rock.
Although the chamber appears to be quite far from human habitation, at the time of its formation there may have been a field on the plateau where the forest is today.
&quot;The fact that the building does not have a window or even a fireplace located in the traditional location clearly proves that no hermit could ever survive the winter here,&quot; explains historian Kamil Podroužek from the Jan Evangelista Purkyně Faculty of Arts in Ústí nad Labem.
The one-room building has only a stone bench at the back, apparently used for storing containers.
&quot;I see it as a chamber for storing some food or products from the field,&quot; adds Kamil Podroužek.
There are visible traces of tools on the walls of the cave.
Breaking sandstone with a canine was quite simple and quick for the insider.
It was enough to use the joints appropriately and gradually break off the sandstone.
Depending on the length of the canine footprint and the method of cutting in general, the period of the cave&#39;s creation can be roughly determined.
According to the historian, it is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and according to the mess that appears in it, nowadays someone sometimes sleeps there.
If you approach the cave from above from one of the forest paths and you are interested in the stream flowing under the cave and the nearby count&#39;s path, you will definitely find the path down as well.
And on the way out of the forest, you might be captivated by the nearby Havraní skaly.
Jockey Minařík is in artificial sleep after a heavy fall in Germany
&quot;Filip is now in the best hands.
The institute is equipped for similar cases, and fortunately we have part of the family in Hannover.
This significantly eases my situation and also the care of my daughter Finja,&quot; the website Jezdci.cz quoted Minařík&#39;s wife Katja as saying.
&quot;Everyone is doing their best, Filip needs time to recover now.
There is no point in making any predictions.
Anyone who has ever dealt with the issue of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Filip is a great fighter.
Now we all have to be patient and give him time,&quot; said the wife of the 45-year-old jockey.
Star Frankie Dettori, who won the seventh King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes race at Ascot on Saturday, equaled the legend Lester Piggott, also called for financial support for the injured Minařík on Twitter.
Almost 70,000 euros have been collected on the Gofundme server to date.
The goal is 100,000 euros (2.6 million crowns).
The video referee took away four goals from Sassuolo footballers, they lost 0:2
The Sassuolo footballers scored four times in the opponent&#39;s goal in Saturday&#39;s match in Naples, but in the end they had to accept a 0:2 defeat.
Neither of their goals was disallowed by the referee after consulting the video for offside.
According to the Italian media, this is a record disadvantage of the technology, VAR has never failed a team with so many interventions.
&quot;VAR was stricter on Sassuolo than the road radar and punished them like no team before.
The new technology is breaking records,&quot; wrote Gazzetta dello Sport in a comment.
&quot;Sassuola&#39;s festival of unrecognized goals.
&quot;VAR has never been so strict on one team,&quot; added Corriere dello Sport.
Napoli took the lead in the 8th minute on Saturday, but after half an hour of play it seemed that Sassuolo had equalised.
However, Filip Djuricič&#39;s goal was disallowed after the intervention of the video referee due to offside.
For the same reason, Djuričič&#39;s next strike and Francesco Caputo&#39;s and Domenico Berardi&#39;s strikes were also unsuccessful.
On the other hand, the home team added one more goal.
Electric cars report a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they were recharged the most in history
&quot;Growth was driven both by the 30 percent increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of new e-car registrations,&quot; said Tomáš Chmelík, head of CEZ&#39;s clean technology department.
Other big players are also claiming their share of the market, such as PRE and E.ON, the manufacturer of electric cars Tesla, but also the supermarkets Billa and Lidl.
Operators of classic gas stations are represented by MOL.
But she doesn&#39;t have numbers yet.
&quot;We only started building our network for electromobility last year,&quot; explained company spokeswoman Jana Jusková.
However, the Deník editorial team exclusively obtained data from all 216 electrical stands operated by ČEZ.
It follows from them that drivers took an average of 13.5 kWh from the stations.
This corresponds to the range of approximately one hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
If we leave aside minor pumping up to 1 kWh, the average charging takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refueling then took place in the free tariff.
If motorists already paid for the collection, their typical spending was around 330 crowns.
Electric mobility is especially popular in the capital.
All five of CEZ&#39;s busiest chargers are located in the territory of Prague, and their popularity overshadows even the entire regional cities.
Among the regions, Olomouc leads.
On the contrary, the least interest is in remote stations in the border areas, for example in Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unused for the whole day.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1,274 new e-cars were added.
In an extensive survey by the Daily &quot;Czechs in motion&quot;, eight percent of readers said that they are considering buying an electric car for their family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Not only for better water retention.
Environmental activists protested in Prague
According to the organizers, the government&#39;s steps to date in the protection and recovery of the Czech landscape and the solution to the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called on the state to take a more vigorous approach.
The event called The Last Drop was attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
&quot;For example, we have people here who have long-term opposition to the expansion of the Turów mine, there are people here who oppose the extraction of gravel and sand at Uherské Ostroh, there are people here who oppose the construction of senseless dams,&quot; Marika Volfová said on behalf of the organizers.
She said that the main demands of the protesters are the creation of a plan to retain water in the landscape, a drastic change in agricultural policy and the subsidy system towards supporting sustainable agriculture and the fastest possible transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
&quot;Government is supposed to protect the interests of the people, not unscrupulous and devastating business,&quot; she said.
A stand with a petition was placed on Malostranské náměstí calling on representatives of the Czech state to advocate for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the restoration of the Czech soil and landscape.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as &quot;End of rapeseed oil&quot; or &quot;Less coal, more newts&quot;.
Jan Škoda from the association Za vodu pro lidi, who is protesting against the gravel-sand mining plan in Hodonínsk, came to Prague from South Moravia.
&quot;It threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people,&quot; he said.
He added that the wells represent the fifth most abundant source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned quarrying of gravel and sand is only about 500 meters from the wells, and according to the reports, it is certain that the quality of the water will be threatened.
Vojtěch Veselý came from the village of Valeč in Karlovy Vary to represent the so-called agro-ecological farmers.
He drew attention to the advantages of small farms that do not chase yields and profits and supply residents directly on the spot.
&quot;Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population quite normally without wreaking such havoc on the countryside and the environment,&quot; he said.
Three people died when a plane crashed into a house in Germany
Three people died and two others were injured when an ultralight plane crashed into an apartment building in western Germany today.
This was reported by the local rescue services, according to which two crew members and one resident of the house are probably among the dead.
The plane crashed into the roof of a building in the town of Wesel in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of five apartment units in the building, subsequently caught fire.
Firefighters have already managed to get the flames under control.
The deputy chief of the local fire department, Robert Meyboom, said that apparently both members of the plane&#39;s crew had died.
According to the police, the third victim is a woman who lived in the house.
The newspaper Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ), citing the mayor of Wesel, wrote that it was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute was found near the accident, which apparently served as a brake during landing.
Police believe it came from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people in the plane.
The plane took off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post newspaper reported, citing eyewitnesses, that the plane collided with a hot air balloon before crashing.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, citing other witnesses, wrote that the plane disintegrated in the air before hitting the ground.
Česká spořitelna erroneously charged some card payments twice on Saturday.
She has already removed the error
Česká spořitelna erroneously charged its clients for some card payments twice on Saturday afternoon.
According to bank spokesman Lukáš Kropík, the problem may have affected thousands of transactions.
The savings bank has already removed the error and returned the money to the clients.
The savings bank noticed problems with double billing of card payments on Saturday afternoon.
&quot;Just last night (Saturday) we updated the system and immediately returned all these duplicate payments to clients.
At the moment, everything is working without problems,&quot; Kropík said on Sunday afternoon.
The bank&#39;s spokesperson does not know the exact number of clients whose card payments were deducted twice by the bank, according to his estimate, it was a lower number of thousands of transactions.
The savings bank is investigating the causes of the problems.
&quot;It could have been a combination of several factors,&quot; said Kropík.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by number of clients.
At the end of March, it had 4.6 million.
The owner of the savings bank is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market of Central and Eastern Europe.
On Monday, Vojtěch will present a system of three emergency levels against the coronavirus
&quot;The degrees will be according to the strength of the community spread at the regional level.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics,&quot; said Vojtěch in ČT.
It will be a so-called traffic light, individual regions will be marked in green, orange or red depending on the risk of the coronavirus.
The minister added that he would still talk to epidemiologists about the inclusion of individual regions.
He admitted that only the Moravian-Silesian region would currently be orange, and Prague would be close to it.
The map will also feature individual measures for regional hygiene stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
&quot;We want to solve it at the level of the regions, because the situation in them is not uniform,&quot; said Vojtěch.
Aquarius and Karolínka
When the waterman Jonáš and the miller&#39;s daughter Karolínka look into each other, things are not easy at all.
Jonáš is prevented from falling in love by his father, the unruly waterman Hastrbuch, while Karolínka has no idea that her beloved Jonáš is not human.
After all, there is the young Libor, who will do everything to protect the whole village, and especially Karolínka, from the villain from the watershed.
What about him scheming and lying?
Especially if he manages to get Karolínka to reject Jonáš and prefer him, the brave Libor.
Before long, it is clear to everyone in the village who is responsible for the drowning of the midnight Kettle, the spoiled flour, the fire at the mill and other mischief.
The enraged villagers organize a hunt for the waterman, and an implacable waterman&#39;s curse falls on Jonáš&#39;s head.
And now Konvička&#39;s little soul Karolínka please!
How to soften old Hastrbuch, convince the neighbors of Jonáš&#39;s innocence, find Jonáš and free him from the spell?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in the ČT studios and in exteriors at the Brzina pond, in Obděnice in Sedlčansk and in the beautiful surroundings of the historic mill in Hoslovice.

The course of the disease in the majority is mild, only three percent of those infected have to go to the hospital
Either a milder form of the coronavirus is spreading in the Czech Republic, or the summer dose of sunshine has significantly improved our immunity.
Hospitals&#39; infectious disease wards are half-empty, even as the numbers of infected people grow.
&quot;The situation today and in April is completely different and it is primarily due to the number of hospitalized patients,&quot; confirms the Minister of Health, Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth remembering that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic was at its peak, everyone wore masks, the army took samples, the republic was closed and the Czechs used up disinfection for the year ahead.
Still, ten people died a day.
Now the daily increases in the number of infected people are higher, but every day a maximum of two people die from covid-19.
Karvinsko still has the highest number of infected per population, Jihlava already has similar numbers due to the outbreak in the local Alzheimer&#39;s center, where there are already 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the elderly was closed by hygienists in Černožice in Královéhradecky.
Tests on one of the nurses confirmed the disease.
&quot;We are tracing, we have restricted movement, we have all hygiene measures,&quot; says the director of the retirement home, Martin Scháněl.
According to him, none of the clients of the home have symptoms of illness yet.
Hygienists will begin extensive testing tomorrow and then decide on further measures.
Hospitals are also responding to the increased number of infected people.
Today, the Oncology Institute in Brno launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which detects whether people are wearing a mask when entering.
The record is reported by South Bohemian hygienists, who recorded twenty-five cases of the coronavirus - most of them are foreign employees of a small company.
In total, 131 infected people were added on Saturday - that is, half of Friday&#39;s number - but fewer tests are conducted on the weekend.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh completed the fairy tale, swept Anderson away
The big surprise of the tournament named Dimitri van den Bergh put in an excellent performance against the player who won the PDC&#39;s second most prestigious event in 2018.
The start of the match was balanced on both sides, the break came at 8:7 for the Belgian darts player.
Van den Bergh took the break with a 13-dart leg and was on top from then on.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game and the significantly more experienced &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; had a hard time reaching doubles.
The way the &quot;Maker of Dreams&quot; had him in his hands is also evidenced by the fact that the flustered Anderson played his first maximum only in the 24th leg.
In addition, the young Belgian handled high checkouts very well.
The last time he lost was in the eleventh leg, but in unfavorable conditions he &quot;caught a big fish&quot; and closed 170.
At the end of the match, Anderson was visibly frustrated.
Rather, he was just throwing away the darts, and his opponent, who was chasing a triumph, was acting completely sovereign.
Van den Bergh converted the first of three match darts and lived up to his name - he wrote his big dream.
Winning the trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable for the Belgian darts player as it is his first major won.
It continues to be the case that the last player who managed to beat van den Bergh is Karel Sedláček.
In Nantes, accusations were made because of the cathedral fire, the man confessed
The Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes caught fire last Saturday, severely damaging the original 16th-century stained glass windows and destroying the organ.
Investigators were investigating suspicion of arson because the fire spread through the temple from three different places.
At the same time, the police did not find any signs of anyone entering the cathedral by force at the entrances.
The accused is a volunteer at the local diocese, a thirty-nine-year-old Rwandan refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without prosecuting him.
Now, the prosecutor&#39;s office reported that, based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, pleaded guilty and faces charges of arson.
If found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a hefty fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the act and has decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, Le Monde wrote.
Vojtěch: On Monday, we will present a &quot;traffic light&quot; for epidemiological measures
The new system is supposed to fulfill the role of a pandemic plan, for the absence of which the government and the Ministry of Health have faced criticism.
&quot;The degrees will be according to the strength of the community spread,&quot; explained the minister.
He added that currently, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach a medium, orange level.
The system is designed as a regional one, because the situation in individual regions differs significantly, he added.
The ministry collaborated on the system with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS).
According to the minister, specific measures will be linked to the individual stages, whether it is the obligation to wear masks or the organization of special departments in hospitals.
Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for the creation of an epidemiological plan on the TV show Prima Partie, according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has been increasing in recent days, although the number of hospitalized patients remains low.
Vojtěch commented that nothing fundamental is happening, it is not appropriate to talk about declaring a state of emergency or reconvening the crisis team.
In view of the growing number of infected people, the government has once again introduced the obligation to wear masks at indoor events of more than 100 people in the whole of the Czech Republic since Saturday.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it is 1000 people.
The government&#39;s approach, where it was not clear until the last moment what measures and when they would come into effect or when they would be announced, was criticized.
&quot;I think that in a situation that is relatively tense, the main actors should instead create a sense of security and, on the contrary, straighten out the confusion,&quot; Senator Marek Hilšer said in Otázky.
The measures can already vary by region, for example in Prague from Sunday it is mandatory to wear masks even in non-residential healthcare facilities, i.e. in pharmacies or in doctor&#39;s waiting rooms.
The obligation to wear face masks when visiting medical and social facilities or pharmacies was also introduced in the Liberec and Ústí Regions from Friday.
In the Vysočina region of Jihlavsk, it is necessary to wear masks in indoor public spaces, in public transport and in medical facilities from July 14.
Conversely, in the Moravian-Silesian Region, anti-epidemic measures have been relaxed, as well as in the Central Bohemian Region in Kutnohorsk.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved the so-called traffic lights for Europe, which color-codes the degree of risk of infection in individual European countries and adjusts the rules applicable to entering the Czech Republic from these countries accordingly.
In countries with a low and medium risk, the authorities do not require Czech citizens to have a negative test for the coronavirus or order a quarantine instead, starting from June 15.
These are mandatory when Czechs return from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU member countries are now in the category of low risk of infection.
Technoparty in Benešovsk continues.
It is playing at a third capacity, it was supposed to end at noon
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešovskogo) Techno party at Hlaváčkova Lhota in Benešovskogo continues on Sunday evening.
A third of the original 12 music systems are still playing.
According to the evening estimates of the police, about 500 people remain here after 8:00 p.m., the original rough estimates were about three hundred, in the morning there were 900, said police spokeswoman Lucie Nováková.
Originally, the techno party was supposed to end at noon on Sunday, at which time some of the music systems actually went silent.
&quot;Some have already left and others are about to leave.
Music production is partly still ongoing.
We expect that music systems will gradually be disconnected and dismantled,&quot; Nováková said.
&quot;Policemen are still consistently checking departing visitors in order to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breathalyzer test before departure,&quot; she added.
The event is supervised by dozens of law enforcement officers, the foreign police, traffic and order police are on site, and dog handlers with service dogs are also on standby.
&quot;During today, the police officers checked 470 people moving around the event venue and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were breathalyzed, of which six got behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol,&quot; said Nováková.
A total of 95 drivers were tested by the police for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances, of which one was positive.
The police also dealt with 14 traffic violations.
At the request of technoparty participants, the police conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
About 2,000 people attended the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants did not decrease, the police would intervene.
Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) said this on the Prima Partie TV show.
However, the number of participants fell below 1,000, so the police assessed that intervention was not needed, and neither the hygiene station nor the Ministry of Health requested it.
Czech Television (ČT) reported on Sunday that the techno party had also spread to the surrounding land, whose owners did not agree to use it for the techno party.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will demand compensation for the damage.
Fans of techno came to the meadow near Hlaváčkova Lhota on Friday evening.
The police originally patrolled the meadow in Blažimi in the Benešovsk region on Friday, where the techno party took place last year.
Blažim is located approximately 30 kilometers from Hlaváčkova Lhota, where the technicians actually gathered.
According to Nováková, no one came to Blažimi.
Viper bite: The little girl ended up in the hospital!
&quot;The first case this year was recorded in Železnorudsk.
There, a viper bit the leg of a girl, born in 2010, whose parents brought her to the local rescue service base,&quot; Mária Svobodová, the regional spokeswoman for the rescue service, told Deník, adding that the child was then taken to a hospital in Klatovy.
The viper is the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic, and it is in Šumava that these animals are found in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance that a viper will bite you is not very high, with normal contact it is afraid of itself.
And if she has room to do so, she likes to crawl away with a loud hiss.
She will only attack if she feels very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on her.
Even its bite is not a tragedy, although its poison is very effective against small mammals, but it will not kill people.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from allergies.
The risk of danger is therefore mainly for children, seniors and allergy sufferers.
&quot;After being bitten, a person often feels like vomiting, sweats, has an elevated temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, and in weakened individuals and especially allergy sufferers, anaphylactic shock can occur,&quot; Miriam Gredová from the Klatovská hospital explained to Deník.
The man threatened to throw the infant out of the window.
He poured wine and threw dishes at the policewoman
After 11:00 p.m., an emergency unit broke into the apartment and detained the man.
The infants were immediately taken into care by paramedics, regional police spokeswoman Markéta Janovská said in a press release.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police, threw dishes and knives at the police negotiator or poured wine over her from the window.
He intensified his threats several times during the negotiations by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
Once he even climbed onto the windowsill himself, where he staggered.
Police are still investigating the man.
He does not want to publish further information yet.
Stosurová will give priority to her daughter before the tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not participate in the season affected by the coronavirus this year.
The 36-year-old champion of the US Open 2011, who became a mother in June, but does not want to end her career just yet.
She plans to return to the courts next year and believes that thanks to her family and daughter, she will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Two weeks ago, Stosur announced on social media that her partner Liz Astling gave birth to a daughter, Genevieve, in mid-June.
&quot;I&#39;m going to stay at home, spend time with my family, be there for all the little milestones that our Evie will experience in the next six months and just enjoy it,&quot; the former world number one doubles player said on the Australian Association&#39;s website.
The WTA Tour will resume its season, suspended since March, on August 3 with a clay court tournament in Palermo.
Sapa market: Raids reveal meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
&quot;One of the vehicles entering the area was transporting 1,320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, moreover, in unsuitable conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in a sanitation company,&quot; the State Veterinary Administration said.
During the inspection of the stand with live fish, it was found that the seller does not have documents on the origin of the goods and is not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market has long been considered problematic from a veterinary point of view.
For example, last fall, veterinarians discovered an illegal food store in it, which contained almost half a ton of unmarked food without proof of origin.
The use-by date could not be determined for most of them, some of the products had expired and were spoiled.
Five kilograms of cuttlefish were three years past their best-by date.
Last May, veterinarians and police officers seized 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, squid or frozen ducks, some of which were moldy, in the area of the market.
Putin had a phone call with Zelensky before the start of the ceasefire in Donbas, the Kremlin criticizes the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in the Donbass, where a new ceasefire is to begin at midnight.
According to the Kremlin&#39;s statement, Putin criticized, among other things, the Ukrainian parliament&#39;s decision to hold local elections; Kyiv reported that Zelenskyy called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
On Wednesday evening, negotiators from Ukraine and Russia, with the support of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), agreed on a new ceasefire.
The ceasefire is to begin after midnight on Monday night, is to be &quot;full and general&quot; and is to pave the way for the fulfillment of other provisions of the peace accords.
In an interview with Zelensky, Putin said that the Ukrainian parliament&#39;s decision to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects for settling the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
The Ukrainian parliament decided last week that the upcoming local council elections will not take place in the territories controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement envisages Kiev regaining control of separatist-occupied Ukrainian territories&#39; border with Russia after granting the regions broad autonomy and holding local elections there.
According to the Unian agency, Zelensky&#39;s office stated that the two statesmen agreed on the benefits of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbass and on the need to take other measures to support peace in this region, such as demining the combat areas or withdrawing part of the troops from the front.
Zelenskyi also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in the east of Ukraine, on the occupied peninsula of Crimea and in Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped to stop the fighting, but people continue to die on both sides of the front in occasional skirmishes and artillery attacks.
The conflict in Donbas has claimed over 14,000 lives since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of providing military support to the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelenskyi has made ending the war in Donbas his priority, but there has not yet been a major breakthrough in the negotiations.
Rykl is the unexpected champion in the decathlon, Novotná dominated the heptathlon
The defender of the last two titles, Doležal, did not complete the 400 at the end of Saturday&#39;s program, Kopecký did not jump the pole vault on Sunday.
The Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing in the group of coach Josef Karas, ruled the decathlon for a long time, but he resigned after the discus.
Rykl has so far had two bronze medals from the outdoor MČR, this time he was the only decathlete who got over the 7,000 mark.
Other medals behind him were won by Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbanek.
After the competition, Rykl recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora.
&quot;It&#39;s a shame that the boys weren&#39;t here and Kope didn&#39;t start, because then the results would have looked completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I put a persona 30 centimeters away.
Then I was pleased with the bar and I was most disappointed with the discus, I was below average there,&quot; he admitted on the association&#39;s Facebook page.
Kateřina Cachová won the first day of the heptathlon with more than one hundred points, despite the fact that she was troubled by an injured ankle on the rebound leg.
However, in the long-distance sector, she only recorded 570 cm, did not throw the javelin 40 meters and did not enter the final round of 16.
Novotná collected 5878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Kateřina Dvořáková.
She excelled mainly in the distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
&quot;I really wanted it to be around 630.
My calf started pulling yesterday, but I&#39;m very happy that I didn&#39;t feel it at all and that it didn&#39;t limit me at all,&quot; said Novotná on the association&#39;s Facebook page.
Bio LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, it promises ecological operation
Liquefied petroleum gas, abbreviated LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is particularly popular because of its fundamentally lower price compared to gasoline or diesel fuel, given the significantly lower consumption tax, but its benefit is also lower CO2 emissions per kilometer traveled.
Similar to gasoline and diesel, it also has its environmentally friendly variant - &quot;bio LPG&quot;.
But it is quite new - it first appeared on the European market last year and, according to the press release of the Czech LPG Association, it arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago.
&quot;These days we received the first fifteen tons of bio LPG, which will be mixed with classic fossil LPG and distributed to our gas stations,&quot; the association quotes Jiří Karlík from the Primagas company.
However, Bio LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to classic petroleum LPG, which many motorists now fill their cars with.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions at will.
&quot;The only difference compared to classic LPG is the production method,&quot; says Ivan Indráček, chairman of the association, about bio LPG.
This is also one of the great advantages of bio LPG compared to other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and also the distribution infrastructure is quite good, for example compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food waste and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted manner, e.g. from cellulosic biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
In contrast, conventional petroleum LPG is produced partly as a by-product during oil refining, partly through separation during natural gas extraction.
As a result, depending on the production technology and the source, running a car on bio LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than running on petroleum LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
But it is not about CO2 emissions from the car&#39;s exhaust, but about the ecology of fuel production, i.e. the so-called &quot;well-to-tank&quot; part.
Petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste are currently among the largest producers of bio LPG.
According to the recent update of the National Clean Mobility Action Plan (NAP ČM), Unipetrol is also investigating the possibility of production at its Litvín refinery.
According to the association&#39;s estimates, about 170,000 vehicles run on LPG in the Czech Republic; the Ministry of the Environment states in the NAP of the Czech Republic a slightly higher figure, roughly 200,000.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 conversions of LPG-powered cars were carried out last year alone.
It is possible to fill up with LPG in the Czech Republic at approximately 950 stations of various operators.
Vojtěch revised the number of infected, the number fell by 1775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) ordered the ministry to revise the number of people infected with the coronavirus.
The Ministry of Health published new statistics on its website on Sunday.
The number on Sunday afternoon dropped from Saturday&#39;s 5,254 to 3,479 cases, which is 1,775 fewer infected.
There are currently 3,422 sick people in the Czech Republic.
&quot;Behind the jump in the number of cured patients is the revision of data, which hygienists have not had time to update recently,&quot; said Jaroslav Dušek, head of health statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people had been infected with the coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11,419 had recovered and 371 had unfortunately succumbed to Covid-19.
Mobile voting units or postal voting.
The political scientist and sociologist were looking for options for the time of the pandemic
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), the law needs to be changed in order for people in quarantine due to the coronavirus to vote in the October regional and senate elections.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated mode.
He stated it on Sunday in Party TV Prima.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of parliamentary parties at the ministry.
&quot;Whatever we do, it will have to mean changing the electoral law,&quot; said Hamáček.
On Wednesday, the Senate called on the government to find a solution within the existing legal rules.
However, the minister said that it will be necessary to amend the provisions of the law, according to which people in quarantine due to their health condition cannot vote.
The ban on voting should remain, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop stated in the OVM program that the possibility of a postal election has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current draft of the law, which is in the Chamber of Deputies, envisages its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of ANO or ČSSD (because, according to experience from abroad, it would rather hurt other types of parties) about postal elections to be overestimated.
He is personally against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a considerable possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that now it is necessary to come up with ad hoc mechanisms (elections) that could be held already this year and with as little health risk as possible.
He considers the main thing to be prepared for the year 2021, when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
He considers the correspondence option (whether abroad or in the Czech Republic) to be one of the functional methods.
They see the already mentioned electoral units or perhaps the possibility of proxy voting within the family as others.
He added that there is an opportunity to learn how similar situations - elections in the time of the coronavirus - were handled in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of the coronavirus, various types of elections in 67 countries around the world have already been postponed this year.
Protests in Bulgaria: Pig ears were thrown by protesters at the government building
Participants in the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
It was another in a series of protests against the &quot;mafia style of governance&quot; that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organizers are planning a nationwide blockade on Wednesday, the DPA agency reported.
Today&#39;s protest, which took place for the 18th day in a row, had a weaker turnout than the previous one, according to the station Rádio Svobodná Evropa/Rádio Svoboda.
By 20:00, around 300 people had gathered, some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Demonstrators staged a theatrical skit in front of the government building in which they symbolically imprisoned Prime Minister Borisov and Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
The resignation of both is one of the basic demands of the protesters.
They also demanded the cancellation of the announced healthcare reform and an end to corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of the protests, Nikolay Hadzhigenov, said on public radio today that the &quot;peak of escalation&quot; in the form of a &quot;nationwide demonstration in Sofia and blockades throughout the country&quot; is planned for Wednesday.
He repeated the demand for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as the calling of early elections.
The regular ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has already announced that he does not intend to resign.
He justified this, among other things, by the need to guide Bulgaria through the covid-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
But on Friday he replaced five members of his government team, although the concession did not appease the protesters.
Earlier this week, Borisov&#39;s government failed a confidence vote in parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovic no longer wants matches without spectators
Boloni football coach Siniša Mihajlovič has had enough of Italian league matches without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that the fans will return to the stadiums from the new season.
&quot;What we are running here at the moment is not football.
I&#39;m fed up with matches without spectators.
It&#39;s sexless football, it brings me no emotion, no joy.
Those matches are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I think I&#39;m not the only one who thinks so,&quot; said Mihajlovic before today&#39;s match against Lecce.
After the coronavirus break, Serie A matches follow in quick succession, and although they are played in the evening, their players are exposed to the heat.
&quot;We play every three days in terrible heat.
In such conditions, you don&#39;t even know how the teams are doing.
Let this season be over.
Those measures had to be taken in order to finish the competition, but I hope that from September the fans will be back,&quot; said the coach, who also managed Fiorentina and AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovič, this season is also unusual because he was absent from the bench for four months due to leukemia treatment.
&quot;Despite my illness, the suspension of the league and everything else, we managed to take our team to a higher level.
We want to keep growing and for that we need the players to be mentally stronger,&quot; he said.
We have become the target of a cyber attack by foreign states, Iran claims
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials have said cyber sabotage may have caused the fire that broke out this month at an underground nuclear facility in Natanz.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told reporters that the Islamic Republic&#39;s infrastructure faces &quot;thousands of cyber attacks every day,&quot; according to Iranian media.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them can be repelled.
According to Mousáví, several broader cyber attacks have been recorded in recent months, behind which, according to analyses, &quot;certain governments and groups&quot; were behind.
However, according to Reuters, he did not provide further details about the possible perpetrators.
Mousáví also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are frequent in the summer.
An article by Iran&#39;s state news agency IRNA this month suggested that Iran&#39;s enemies, such as Israel and the US, may have been behind the recent incidents.
However, none of these countries were directly accused of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States severed diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian student militants attacked the US embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-strained relations between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have hit its economy hard.
Another significant escalation came this year after the US military killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi Muhandis on January 3.
Then on January 8, Iran fired a number of missiles at the bases in Iraq where the Americans operate.
The US later admitted that dozens of American soldiers had been wounded.
Israel considers Iran its arch-enemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a major opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
The TPCA automaker has extended the production shutdown, now until May 25
Cologne-based Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has again extended its production shutdown due to the coronavirus.
The production lines are expected to start up again on the morning of Monday, May 25.
The launch will be accompanied by dozens of hygiene measures, said the car company&#39;s spokesman Tomáš Paroubek.
Production has stopped due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of March 18.
The company originally intended to restore it on Monday, May 18.
According to Paroubek, the reason for the extension of the shutdown is the closed borders and closed dealerships, so there is no one to sell cars.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce at 100 percent from the beginning, i.e. in two shifts.
The company&#39;s key markets, such as Italy, Great Britain or Spain, are affected by the coronavirus.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Změna pro Kolín) said that the shutdown of production at TPCA does not affect life in the city.
&quot;You could tell from the beginning, the city was empty.
But gradually the streets are filling up, especially now since Monday, when things have loosened up a lot.
So the city is full,&quot; Kašpar said.
According to him, there are no complications even with the foreign workers who stayed in the hostels.
&quot;During those two months, we had to solve almost no problem,&quot; Kašpar said.
For example, Škoda Auto from Mladá Boleslav, which also suspended production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed it on Monday, April 27, at all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
Neither plant is operating at 100 percent capacity.
The resumption of production in Škoda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night from Monday to Tuesday, the third, i.e. night shift, took place in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the resumption of production.
Around 2,500 people currently work at TPCA, and the company is one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and at the same time an employer in the Kolín region.
Cancer kills bride shortly after wedding: She left a message for her family
For more than two years, Gemma Sisson fought with an insidious cancer, and when it seemed that she had beaten the cancer, the disease struck again.
The 39-year-old woman, who loved bodybuilding, ended up in a hospice bed, where she was still able to marry the love of her life.
Unfortunately, she succumbed to the disease.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message for those closest to her appeared on her Facebook account.
Originally from Leeds, England, Gemma Sisson loved bodybuilding.
She and her boyfriend of more than 16 years, Ricky Moore, traveled to competitions around the world.
The 39-year-old woman played sports and lived a healthy life, but she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma began grueling treatment, radiotherapy, in the hope of recovery.
After months of treatment, Gemma really seemed to have beaten the cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned, this time in her spine.
The bodybuilder and personal trainer, according to information from the British newspaper Daily Mirror, underwent a ten-hour spinal operation and then started again with drastic treatment.
But everything was in vain.
Earlier this year, on her 39th birthday, doctors told her she had a few months to live.
In April, the pretty blonde finally decided to join a hospice in Leeds, where her family visited her every now and then, and even arranged a wedding for her with her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
The last time Ricky took Gemma to a restaurant was on their two month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just a few hours after the death, a post that Gema wrote for her family appeared on her social network account.
“If this has been published, it means I have finally died after weeks of fighting too long.
Although I will be heartbroken to leave my loved ones here, I will be so happy to be free of what this horrible disease has done to me.
I can&#39;t thank Ricky enough who was by my side the whole time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during this terrible time,&quot; she wrote on the social network, saying that the pain and suffering had finally stopped and she had found peace.
&quot;I&#39;m also grateful for all the support I&#39;ve received from all my followers on social media,&quot; she wrote, adding that everyone should value their life and live it to the fullest.
Art machines sell a sweat dating book, a mushroom amulet, and a pexe
For one hundred crowns, a passer-by can get a pocket-sized work by mostly budding Czech artists.
They create pictures and other creations directly for artmat, so they know in advance that they must fit into the size of 8.5 by 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
&quot;In the package there is always a curatorial text about the artist and then the work itself,&quot; specified the curator of the project, Petra Widžová.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
The buyer can be surprised by what kind of work of art he gets.
Currently, he can become the new owner of fantastic illustrations by Alexandra Štoplová or mini-views by Tereza Bonaventurová, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23, in collaboration with Dora Dutková, prepared a pexeso connected with a walk through Prague.
Cards need to be paired with house signs.
Ilona Polanski created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliána Chomová sell pocket-sized packages of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet made of sedum and divination cards, the second a series of illustrations based on her comic book Spiritists.
Salaries in the healthcare sector will increase by a maximum of five percent next year.
According to Vojtěch, a larger increase is unrealistic
Salaries in the health sector could increase by no more than five percent next year, said the Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) in Otázky Václav Moravec on Czech Television.
He considers the trade unionists&#39; demand for an increase of up to 15 percent unrealistic.
He also said that the state should strive to be self-sufficient in providing protective equipment.
According to him, the hospital now has their supplies.
&quot;I think that the increase (of salaries) can be somewhere up to five percent,&quot; said the minister.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect on the current situation, when since March the coronavirus pandemic and government regulations against its spread have interfered with the selection of insurance.
Insurance companies&#39; incomes fell at that time.
&quot;I think a 15 percent increase is unrealistic at the moment,&quot; said Vojtěch.
According to data from the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS), the average monthly earnings of doctors in acute inpatient care will probably reach 88,312 crowns this year, and 47,498 crowns for nurses.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of other providers will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The ÚZIS data also show that the decrease in nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was 34,125 crowns in 2019, according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
Trade union representatives already stated in June that for 2021 they would demand a minimum increase of ten percent, ideally 15 percent.
They criticize the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must follow salary tables, and contractual wages in city, county or private hospitals.
Therefore, they also demand that the salary scales for health workers be uniform.
For nurses this year, the difference will reach up to seven thousand crowns per month.
For example, wages for doctors grew faster than salaries last year.
According to Roman Šmucler, president of the Czech Stomatological Chamber, trade unionists should perceive the current situation.
Due to the effects of the covid epidemic, the Chamber of Deputies recently approved an increase in this year&#39;s state budget deficit to a record 500 billion crowns, of which 1.75 billion is to go to the remuneration of health workers in hospitals and social services.
According to Šmucler, the Council of Health Care Providers does not agree with a general salary increase next year.
According to him, the hospitals and medical facilities themselves should decide on remuneration, and the extra money should go to them through the reimbursement decree.
Vojtěch also stated that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
The chairman of the State Material Reserves Administration (SSHR) Pavel Švagr said this week that the administration does not currently have a single protective medical device in its possession.
Awaiting the completion of tenders.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March, when they were bought out.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and also buy from Czech companies.
The scrubbing smart quarantine could be taken over by soldiers.
We are ready, they say
&quot;The smart quarantine works, of course there is room for improvement.
We will discuss this with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly and the question is whether they should manage the whole thing again,&quot; the prime minister said on Sunday in his Facebook program Chow lidi.
According to him, it is not possible to sufficiently connect IT systems and hygiene stations, which must gradually switch to more modern methods of operation.
According to the prime minister, the problems were in the Moravian-Silesian region, where there are some of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek told ČTK that he had no information about Sunday&#39;s meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
According to him, the army is ready for this step.
The Ministry of Health took over the smart quarantine project on May 25.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by a ninety-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body to the government, led by former deputy minister Roman Prymula.
The abrasive project was criticized on Sunday by Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
He also suggested that the army could take him on again.
Vladimír Dzurilla, the government commissioner for IT and digitization, who is in charge of the project, previously admitted shortcomings in the project.
&quot;The system works, but it&#39;s still a work in progress.
For twenty years it was created independently and unsystematically, now we are trying to unify it in a few months.
It&#39;s not a jet.
People on the go, poor people on hygiene, adapt the new systems on the go and actually pick up the mistakes,&quot; he said.
Ostrava Mayor Macura will not run again, because he does not want to &quot;go crazy in politics&quot;
The current mayor of Ostrava, Tomáš Macura (ANO), will not be a candidate in the next municipal elections.
The reason is the effort &quot;not to be stupid in politics,&quot; he told the Respekt.cz server.
Macura, who is also a member of the board of the ANO movement, has been the mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, the candidate of the ANO movement in Ostrava led by him won almost a third of the votes.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
&quot;I thought to myself that I would last one term and with my business experience, I would be able to turn everything around here during that time and get it back on its feet,&quot; he told Respekt.
He added that he had been persuaded to a certain extent for a second term.
&quot;But for me it&#39;s the maximum.
I don&#39;t want to fool around in politics,&quot; added Macura, who described himself in the interview as a difficult introvert who does not like frequent contact with people.
According to Respekt, there has been speculation for a long time about Macura&#39;s possible end in the ANO movement.
The server recalls that Macura criticized the ANO movement several times, for example for its alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Miloš Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few personalities of ANO, he supported Zeman&#39;s opponent Jiří Drahoš in the elections.
Macura has no plans to leave the ANO movement, which he joined in 2017.
&quot;As long as I have the feeling that I can change something in the movement, that it is not a completely futile struggle and that no one will bother me, I have no immediate motive to quit,&quot; he told Respekt.
Fifty-six-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before he became the mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura worked, among other things, as a director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also sat on the boards of other companies.
Uber, offering transport services, will return to Brno
Uber, which offers transportation services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
It is the result of a change in the law, Brno councilor for transport Petr Kratochvíl (ODS) said in a press statement on Thursday.
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet conditions such as being labeled as a taxi or a taximeter.
However, due to a change in the law, the conditions for operating regular taxis as well as alternative taxis have changed since July.
In recent weeks, Kratochvíl has had several meetings with representatives of the Uber company.
&quot;Based on them, this company decided to return its services to Brno at the end of July this year.
This move is the result of a change in the law that allows this company to operate legally.
The city has been informed of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits,&quot; said Kratochvíl.
Uber operated in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against him because the vehicles were not marked as taxis or because there was no taximeter.
The court issued a preliminary injunction banning Uber from driving in the city.
Brno originally supported taxi drivers, but at the end of last year, Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions, Uber could drive in Brno, but the company did not use it.
It will now return due to a change in the law.
Since July, in addition to classic taxis with a lamp and a taximeter, it is easier to operate a transport service that can be ordered and paid exclusively via mobile applications.
Too exuberant celebration in Brno: a flying chair landed a meter from a person on the sidewalk
An office chair flew from the fourth floor of an apartment building in Brno on Saturday evening and landed about a meter from the sidewalk.
A pedestrian was following him at that moment, who immediately called the police.
Immediately after arriving at the indicated address in the western part of the city, the patrol noticed an open window, under which a chair was still lying and several cans and cigarette butts next to it.
“The noise coming from the room on the fourth floor indicated that a rather noisy celebration was taking place inside.
The officers went down the corridor to the apartment and asked the three young men present, aged between twenty-six and twenty-nine, for an explanation,&quot; said Jakub Ghanem, the officer&#39;s spokesman.
Babiš will discuss the request to recall Rafaj with the ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats on Monday the request for the dismissal of the head of the Antimonopoly Office (ÚOHS) Petr Rafaj.
Non-profit organizations called for Rafaj&#39;s dismissal at the meeting of the government&#39;s anti-corruption council, as well as the Ústí Region.
The Social Democrats say a change at the head of the office is in order.
According to information from ČTK, Rafaj was not invited to the Government Office on Monday.
His second mandate will end in the middle of next year, according to the law he cannot be appointed for a third time.
His dismissal is within the competence of President Miloš Zeman.
In addition to the appeal of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister also received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí Region.
The reason is supposed to be, among other things, Rafaj&#39;s recent cases.
In the past week, the Prime Minister refused to comment on the request, saying that he would familiarize himself with the materials and that the government parties would take &quot;some position&quot; on it.
He also stated that he has not yet discussed the challenges with the president, and has not arranged a meeting with him in the near future.
According to the statement of the ÚOHS, there is no reason to appeal because Rafaj was not accused of anything.
The servers IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz wrote last week that the police are interested in Rafaj&#39;s meetings with Governor Jiří Čunk.
The meetings were related, among other things, to the decision on the competition for the project of the controversial new hospital in Zlín for eight billion, which Čunek is strongly promoting.
Čunek admitted the meetings, according to him, they dealt with his &quot;senate activities&quot; together.
Rafaj speaks similarly.
The representative of the Ústí Region called on the government to recall Rafaje at the end of June.
He also requests a reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the office.
According to Deputy Governor for Transport Jaroslav Komínek, the decision-making of the ÚOHS regarding public contracts is not transparent and has signs of arbitrariness.
Last March, the police intervened at the antimonopoly office due to a toll collection tender.
In June of this year, the server Aktuálně.cz drew attention to the fact that Rafaj was using apartments registered to the company of an influential backstage player of the ČSSD, Alexander Čuba.
However, the 3.5 million deposit for the apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj&#39;s account.
Rafaj has been the chairman of the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition since July 9, 2009. The president appointed the former member of the Social Democratic Party for a second term in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafaj&#39;s second six-year mandate will expire.
The Antimonopoly Office Act states that the president can dismiss the head of the office at the proposal of the government.
He can only be dismissed if he does not perform his duties for more than six months, or seriously violates the dignity of his position or the independence and impartiality of the office.
Employees collapsed in the Blanen library due to the heat.
Air conditioning will help
The new equipment will cost 740,000 and will be in operation in the second half of August.
&quot;It&#39;s good news for me.
With three children, we regularly go to the library in the center of Blansko.
In the warm months, however, it was practically impossible to stay there.
It was terribly hot and bad air.
Ventilation did not help.
That&#39;s why I&#39;m glad for the air conditioning,&quot; said one of the readers from Blanen, Petr Novotný.
According to the director of the library Lukáš Dlapa, temperatures in the building often rose to over thirty degrees.
The southern wall of the building is glazed and functions as a greenhouse on sunny days.
&quot;In addition, thanks to the curvature of the building, the sun leans into it for a large part of the day.
At the same time, it is a big problem to ventilate the individual departments, because the windows must be closed overnight for safety reasons.
It&#39;s often thirty degrees in the library already in the morning,&quot; said Dlapa.
The worst was the study and reading room on the third floor.
And one floor higher then the exhibition rooms and the director&#39;s office.
The climate was also unpleasant in the children&#39;s department, which is located under the roof of the building.
&quot;It happened several times that librarians collapsed at work and ended up incapacitated.
The problem also regularly arose in the cultural room during lectures, which are attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, it was impossible to breathe there,&quot; noted Dlapa.
Originally, the city representatives wanted to install air conditioning in all library spaces this year.
In the end, there will be only three circuits out of five.
&quot;Due to limited funding, only the most problematic areas will have air conditioning.
Study room and reading room on the third floor.
Next, the culture room and the children&#39;s department one floor higher,&quot; informed Jiří Svoboda from the Blanes investment department.
He added that in the first phase, the workers had already installed air conditioning and modified the electrical installation in the aforementioned premises last fall.
For approximately 360 thousand crowns.
The Blansko City Library has almost three thousand registered readers.
Of these, about nine hundred are under the age of fifteen.
The mainstay of Chicago banished the coronavirus.
Crawford is back in the game
Not all of the infected athletes come out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to players from the NHL, which is as silent as the grave about the health status of players and does not publish anything at all.
He was one of the few who stepped out of the Crawford line.
The 35-year-old native of Montreal was only present at the first training session, since then he has been absent from the lineup.
&quot;I would like to inform you all that I have tested positive for Covid-19 and because of this I have spent the last fortnight locked in my house,&quot; he revealed the reason for his absence.
Fans no longer have to worry about his health.
Crawford is ready to throw himself into a full load again.
&quot;It&#39;s great to be back.
I will do everything to get in shape as soon as possible,&quot; he added.
The experienced goalkeeper won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, and is a regular part of the goal for the tenth season in a row.
The Blackhawks first have a preparatory duel with St. Louis, then face Edmonton in the preliminary round.
Thousands of people protested in Israel against the prime minister
Thousands of Israelis protested unemployment, corruption and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#39;s handling of the coronavirus crisis in several parts of the country.
The demonstrations took place, among other things, in front of Netanyahu&#39;s private villa in the city of Caesarea, near his official residence and in a park in Tel Aviv.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, protests have been taking place regularly for several weeks.
Their participants are demanding Netanyahu&#39;s resignation over the trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, as well as over the government&#39;s handling of the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
&quot;Bibi, go home,&quot; one protester wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu&#39;s commonly known nickname, according to the AP.
&quot;All see the Emperor has lost his clothes,&quot; read another.
Seventy-year-old Netanyahu is the first prime minister of Israel to be tried while in office.
He is accused in three cases of corruption, fraud and breach of trust.
He rejects all the accusations and calls them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial may last up to three years, over 300 witnesses have been summoned.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in Israel, which has about nine million inhabitants, in almost 60,500 people.
455 people died in connection with the infection.
The Israeli government introduced quarantine measures in March to help reduce the daily increase in infections.
After the gradual easing of restrictions from the end of April, however, the number of infected people began to rise again, especially at the end of June.
Netanyahu&#39;s critics claim that the government has not sufficiently helped, for example, businessmen affected by quarantine measures.
The protesters are also bothered by the fact that the government issues contradictory instructions in the fight against the coronavirus.
The driver crashed the car into a tree and died.
Firefighters had to cut the body out of the wreckage
The tragic accident happened around 11:00 p.m. near Neveklov on a narrow district leading from the Slapská dam.
The driver apparently flew down into the forest at a considerable speed and crashed the car into a tree.
He died on the spot.
Firefighters had to extricate the body from the wreck, among other things they cut off the roof.
The police are investigating the circumstances of the accident.
They ordered a forensic autopsy, which should, among other things, clarify whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
No more waste and churning out one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on this with a fundamental change in strategy.
He cancels discounts and no longer wants to churn out one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is among the biggest polluters of the environment is nothing new.
Billions of clothes end up in incinerators and landfills every year.
However, the view of slow fashion, an often despised approach to dressing, has been changing relatively quickly in recent years.
Pietro Filipi sold about half of the goods at full price.
They simply won&#39;t buy the other half, which was sold thanks to discounts.
The company does not want to churn out one collection after another and at the end of each season to discount the products below their production price.
In addition, according to owner Michal Mička, the days of new and old collections and blindly following rapidly changing fashion trends are over.
&quot;Most retailers already calculate discounts when purchasing goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
So it&#39;s actually a bit of a scam,&quot; says the owner of Pietro Filipi, Michal Mička.
In addition, with its approach, the company also wants to support local business.
&quot;Each of our products is made from carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection consists of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothes that are timeless and out of season.
Globally, the absence of any discounts is typical for the segment of premium brands, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality, so there is no need for a discount,&quot; adds Mička.
The giant graffiti features RAF airman Kurt Taussig
&quot;The assignment was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in the Second World War.
The city management liked the proposal,&quot; said Vacek, who completed his work after a fortnight of intensive creation.
He used approximately 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Šanov.
He left the city when he was 15 years old.
During the war, because of his Jewish origin, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp, where they kept him for several weeks.
However, he and his brother managed to avoid a concentration camp thanks to the organization of Nicholas Winton.
In 1939, Taussig reached Great Britain, where he voluntarily joined the Royal Air Force (RAF), and later underwent pilot training in the African Southern Rhodesia and Palestine.
He joined combat operations at the beginning of 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic and his native Teplice several times, which granted him honorary citizenship.
Forty-six-year-old Kamil Vacek, who people in the street graphic art industry know by the nickname Camo, has been working with sprays in the streets of Teplice for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on areas set aside for these purposes by the then mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Hurricane Hanna has reached the Texas coast
Hurricane Hanna arrived on the southwest coast of the US state of Texas on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight CET tonight).
It hit Padre Island, Texas, about 15 miles (24 km) north of the town of Port Mansfield, and weakened to a tropical storm as it moved over land.
However, according to meteorologists, it still poses a great danger to residents of coastal areas.
For it brought with it a strong wind and intense rainfall; along with local flooding, power outages and various material damages, including damaged ships, are reported according to the AP agency.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott already declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwest Texas on Saturday and advised people to voluntarily evacuate.
People from the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay received the strongest warnings, but in total the element is expected to hit an area of almost 500 kilometers before gradually moving over northeastern Mexico.
&quot;Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and winds, rising water levels, dangerous surf and isolated tornadoes may pose a threat,&quot; the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned.
This morning local time (afternoon CET), the storm moved in the area of the US-Mexico border and was accompanied by winds of 85 kilometers per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year&#39;s Atlantic hurricane season on Saturday.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometers per hour, but it gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour as it approached land, which once again eliminated Hanna from the hurricane category.
The authorities urged local residents to wait out the storm at home and not to forget the hygiene measures associated with the prevention of the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is one of the American states most affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
Due to the existing security measures and the need to keep a safe distance, possible evacuations are also a big challenge.
Makeshift shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as a shelter for evacuees who tested positive for the coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the infection.
Local authorities urged all evacuees to take masks and disinfectant gels with them to the shelter if possible.
&quot;We&#39;re not even close to it yet.
We expect catastrophic flooding,&quot; Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Brownsville, was quoted as saying by the AP.
Forecasters say up to 300 millimeters of rain could fall in a few hours in some places, and in some cases almost 500 millimeters, which, along with rising sea levels, could inundate a number of coastal settlements.
Zeman confers the rank of general on Colonel Lipko
On Wednesday, President Miloš Zeman will confer the rank of general on Colonel Pavlo Lipko.
This follows from the Ministry of Defense&#39;s overview of expected events.
The reason for conferring the rank of brigadier general is Lipka&#39;s appointment to the post of deputy commander of the alliance&#39;s multinational division Northeast in Poland in August.
Lipka still works as the deputy commander of the ground forces of the Czech army.
The promotion to Zeman was proposed by the government at the end of June.
From the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karel Řehka in the position of Deputy Commander of the Multinational Division Northeast in Elblag, Poland, which commands the units of the Alliance forward presence in Poland and the Baltics.
Řehka became the director of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security (NÚKIB) in March.
The government suggested to the president that Lipek be given the rank of brigadier general.
According to the Act on Professional Soldiers, a higher rank may be granted to a soldier for the period of performance of an elected position or for the period of performance of a service task that requires the granting of a higher rank.
The post of deputy commander of an alliance division corresponds to the rank of general.
A soldier who has been granted a rank has the same rights and obligations as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to a salary adjustment that would correspond to the given rank.
The grant of rank lasts until the end of the reason for which it was granted.
&quot;Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional readiness and is a role model for his subordinates.
He participates in a significant way in fulfilling the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the army&#39;s participation in foreign operations,&quot; the Ministry of Defense said in June regarding the promotion proposal.
Wednesday&#39;s promotion will take place at 12:30 at Prague Castle, and will be attended by Minister of Defense Lubomír Metnar and Chief of the General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help limit the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is keeping a distance or wearing masks on the plane and at the airport, but the middle seats in the planes will not have to remain unoccupied.
This was reported by the Reuters agency.
&quot;I am glad that my colleagues accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards,&quot; Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and that it still had to be formally approved by the ministers.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose for passengers from the age of six, to maintain the recommended distance during security checks and check-in at the airport.
Plenty of fresh air must also be guaranteed in airplanes and all information must be available in several languages.
Airlines will also be able to occupy middle seats.
The joint regulations officials agreed to meet at least some of the airlines&#39; requirements.
Different standards caused confusion.
A temperature record was set on the arctic Svalbard, where they measured almost 22 degrees
&quot;A 41-year-old record has been broken in Longyearbyen,&quot; the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
By early evening, the temperature there had risen to 21.7 degrees Celsius, beating the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees, he added.
Longyearbyen, with a population of about 2,000, is the largest city on Svalbard, located about 1,300 kilometers from the North Pole.
Svalbard is warming faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the dangers of warming in other parts of the Arctic -⁠ from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report last year by the Norwegian Center for Climate Studies.
According to him, the average temperature on Svalbard has risen by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By the year 2100, it may rise by as much as ten degrees if the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is not reduced.
An increase in temperature may result in the thawing of permafrost on Svalbard, which will threaten the stability of many buildings, roads and airports and may also cause more avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming also threatens Arctic fauna, such as polar bears and seals, which depend on the ocean&#39;s ice cover.
Britons returning from Spain face a mandatory two-week quarantine
The British Cabinet has also urged citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to mainland Spain due to the risk of the spread of the covid-19 disease.
The Canary and Balearic Islands are not mentioned, however, even after returning from them, people have to go into isolation for two weeks.
The new rules take effect at midnight.
&quot;Protecting public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain,&quot; the British Foreign Office said in a statement.
&quot;We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the safe list,&quot; she added.
As noted by the British newspaper Metro, the latest announcement will affect the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is a very popular holiday destination.
Among other things, Britons are worried about whether they will be paid sick leave if they have to self-isolate for 14 days after returning from vacation.
For example, Neil Hunter from the town of Sittingbourne booked a ten-day holiday to Lanzarote, they were supposed to fly out on Tuesday.
They have booked the trip since December.
&quot;The whole family was supposed to go, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest after this announcement I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen.
I work as a train driver and I don&#39;t think my employer will agree that I will be quarantined for two weeks after returning from vacation,&quot; Metro quoted Hunter as saying.
Regarding Spain, there are fears that the country is at the beginning of a second wave of the epidemic.
Over the past two days, there have been over 900 new infections every 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, for example Catalonia is trying to limit all nightlife to prevent people from gathering in large numbers.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently drawn attention to the increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
The government will discuss the electricity purchase model from Dukovan
On Monday, the government will discuss the electricity purchase model from the planned new unit of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The bill envisages that if the buy-in price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, all consumers will pay the difference through tariffs.
In the second case, when the purchase price will be lower than the market price, the impact on the consumer will be the opposite.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for customers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for ANO) and the energy company ČEZ have previously stated that the more likely option is that people will save on electricity due to the construction.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices on the markets is always uncertain, as developments in the past have shown several times.
The plan has already been criticized by environmental organizations.
&quot;The purchase price can be both below and above the market price of power electricity.
The final impact at the time of applicability of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - in case of lower consumption or according to electricity consumption - in case of higher electricity consumption,&quot; the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) stated in the documents related to the material.
In May, Havlíček said that he assumed that the wholesale price of electricity would rise and that the people on the Dukovan construction site would earn money.
Otherwise, the impact will be tens of crowns per family per year, which, according to him, is far less than people pay annually in electricity bills to support so-called supported resources.
He had previously estimated that the purchase price could be between 50 and 60 euros (about 1,320 and 1,600 CZK) per megawatt hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposal for the amount, it should only be included in the purchase agreement.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for the year 2021, for which traders are currently stocking up the most, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 CZK) per MWh.
&quot;With a difference between the purchase price and the market price of power electricity in the amount of ten euros, the extra payment for an average household with a consumption of 3.3 MWh per year could be equivalent to a household of four, equipped as standard with electrical appliances including an electric hob and oven, but which does not use electricity for heating and hot water heating - less than 100 CZK/year,&quot; wrote the MPO in documents for the government.
&quot;We live in extremely turbulent times.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be a purely speculative matter,&quot; Tomáš Voltr, executive director of the investment group Energy financial group, told ČTK earlier.
The proposed law envisages that the purchase would be carried out by the MPO, or a legal entity authorized by it, owned by the state, at a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the state, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even repeatedly, but at the latest until the end of the operation of low-carbon production.
The proposal defines a low-carbon production plant as an electricity production plant with a nuclear reactor connected to the electricity system with an installed capacity of at least 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček previously stated that the new Dukovany block should have a capacity of 1,200 MW and produce nine terawatt hours of electricity annually, which would correspond to a tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The block should be commissioned in 2036.
The government approved the financing model for the new Dukovany block on Monday.
During construction, the state should finance the facility interest-free, with two percent interest calculated during operation.
The opposition does not agree with the financing model, it is also bothered by the possibility that Dukovany would be built by Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should participate in 70 percent of the construction.
The rest should be paid by ČEZ, which will also cover all possible additional costs.
ČEZ CEO Daniel Beneš told ČTK in May that the expected sum for the construction of the unit at current prices is roughly six billion euros (approximately 162 billion crowns).
The contracts between the state and ČEZ on the construction of the new Dukovany block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry for Regional Development withdrew material on the promotion of tourism in the media for two billion
The authority withdrew the material, according to which the Ministry for Regional Development (MMR) planned to spend two billion crowns in the media, on the Internet and on billboards for advertising on holidays in the Czech Republic.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for ANO) told the SeznamZprávy.cz server that the material is still being worked on.
The Zdopravy.cz server drew attention to the document in eKlep (the electronic library of the legislative process) on Friday.
The ministry justified the plan with the drop in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the media also experienced a drop in revenue.
The proposal drew criticism from the opposition and representatives of the tourism industry.
According to the proposal, which can now be viewed on the hlidacstatu.cz website, the MMR planned to give money for advertising on television, radio, the press, on the Internet, billboards and areas at railway stations through the state tourism promotion agency CzechTourism.
Televisions would receive the largest part of the money, 700 million crowns.
The majority would be acquired by private televisions Nova and Prima.
Printed dailies and weeklies would receive 400 million, and the MMR would give the same share for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
The radio stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, the majority of which again private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and areas at stations and in the subway.
The campaign to support tourism in the Czech Republic was supposed to start in mid-August and last a year.
&quot;The material is still being worked on, it is certainly not yet in the form that should be presented,&quot; Dostálova told the SeznamZprava server without further details.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09 Markéta Pekarová Adamová, the media would profit from the advertisement from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO).
&quot;I firmly believe that this flamboyant contempt will be hit between the eyes in the fall elections,&quot; she wrote on Twitter.
Dostálová denies that it is actually about helping the media affected by the crisis.
&quot;It could also be a coincidence, I don&#39;t know anything about media support,&quot; she told Denik N on Friday.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
&quot;Of course, we are still calculating it, it can be less or more.
It&#39;s work material,&quot; she added.
The media campaign to support domestic tourism does not make sense to the Zachraňme tourismus initiative.
&quot;We want two billion for companies in the tourism industry, not an unnecessary advertising campaign,&quot; the chairman of the initiative, Tomáš Barčík, said on Sunday.
If the two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should go to companies, not the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
The broth of life, the tap of beer, and death like a blade of grass
The third album entitled A death is a blade of grass of the Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also passed away a year ago, on May 24, is also posthumous.
It is the fifth item in Frič&#39;s discography and, similarly to the previous titles, the main emphasis here is on Frič&#39;s poetry, of which he himself is an excellent interpreter.
Frič, born in 1949, was understandably influenced by the American beat generation, but he channeled this inspiration through his own, uniquely presented experiences and also very inner expressions of faith.
However, he was far from any agitation, if he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, completely tolerant.
Bohuslav Reynek comes to mind in that context (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček, for example), the masters will forgive.
Frič&#39;s album offers recordings of the author&#39;s reading from 2006, but also performances with musicians who always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was cellist Josef Klíč, or Honza Bartoň and Vítězslav Holata.
I will - gladly - use the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Frič&#39;s long poetic compositions.
&quot;A proud and never-ending bitterness emanated from them,&quot; writes Hruška, &quot;over the state of our endangered world.
The world, which is sinking more and more into numb consumerist vanity and avarice, is moving more and more away from what its soul was made of - from the mystery of faith, humility and human closeness.
They echoed the longing of someone who knows that the values for which he was created are of little interest, but who also knows that they cannot be renounced just because of general disinterest.
Those poems reminded that one may have to lose everything dear, but it is not unimportant how one loses it.
Whether he sells himself to the general decline, resigns himself with skepticism, falls fearfully silent, or remains to the last moment in a calm and proud insistence on what he believes and loves.&quot;
Paroubek is not my adviser, said Hamáček
Former prime minister and chairman of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek is not a paid adviser to social democracy.
Party leader and Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamáček said this today on the TV program Prima Partie.
The SeznamZprávy.cz website reported on Friday that Paroubek should be Hamáček&#39;s adviser.
&quot;We text each other from time to time, he sometimes sends me some material and I read it,&quot; Hamáček said today.
He added that, however, this is not an official and paid collaboration.
According to him, the ČSSD does not have the resources to waste them on similar purposes.
&quot;The fact that I sometimes read his opinion, there are a lot of people like that,&quot; he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MP Jana Černochová, the minister said that many ODS members still &quot;openly listen to the views of Václav Klaus&quot;.
According to him, it&#39;s okay because he is an experienced politician and former party chairman, which is also the case with Paroubek.
He called the fact that the media is making an affair out of it a sign of this year&#39;s cucumber season.
The SeznamZprávy.cz server wrote on Friday that Paroubek fulfills the role of Hamáček&#39;s unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the former chairman of the local cell, Petr Benda, who is connected to Paroubek and served as vice-chairman of his party LEV 21, is aiming for the fourth place of the party&#39;s candidate in the Ústí region.
Hamáček said today that he will not comment on the composition of the candidate list until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mile lead, it&#39;s a kick in the ass, laments the Swede&#39;s challenger
It is the 22-year-old American pole vaulter who has the ambition and potential to be among the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it&#39;s like to beat Duplantis, who is two years younger than him, beating him at the NCAA meet last year.
&quot;We had a battle the year before, he won and I was second, then we exchanged it.
In both cases it was a very good fight,&quot; describes Nilsen, who secured victory with a performance of 5.95 meters.
But Duplantis has skyrocketed since then and currently finds himself alone in pole vaulting&#39;s highest circles.
At just twenty years old, he became a world record holder, on February 8 this year in Toruń he broke the bar of 6.17 meters, a week later in Glasgow he added another centimeter.
&quot;He jumped six meters already at the age of 18, when he finished high school,&quot; recalls his peer Nilsen for the World Athletics website.
&quot;It was clear that once he matured from boy to man, all his potential and talent would multiply tenfold.
Twenty years is quite a good age to jump the world record,&quot; he believes.
Although Nilsen&#39;s list of achievements is noticeably thinner than that of Duplantis, the American sets similar goals.
So far, he has shown his potential at NCAA competitions, which he regularly won, in one of them this February he improved his indoor personal record to 5.93 m. trip to the world championship, where he finished 13th.
The closest milestone for him is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
&quot;It&#39;s definitely my priority to get on the pro circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League because that&#39;s where you can make a name for yourself,&quot; he realizes.
&quot;When you can succeed at this level, there&#39;s no doubt you can do the same at events like the Olympics, the World Championships or the Pan American Games.&quot;
However, due to the pandemic, these peak holidays are postponed, which gives Nilsen and the other pole vaulters time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn the five-ring race into a mere fight for silver?
&quot;Everyone is trying to catch up with him, but I don&#39;t think it will be possible in the near future,&quot; Nilsen thinks.
“The kid has been jumping for 16 years and is miles ahead of everyone else in training.
And before Tokyo 2021 begins, he will want to increase it even more.
A woman spent hundreds of thousands of her disabled son&#39;s disability pension.
She faces trial
The money that the 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is primarily intended to improve the quality of his life.
The woman faces up to eight years in prison for embezzlement.
Due to his poor health, the court deprived the sick man of his legal rights and appointed his mother as guardian, who was supposed to manage her son&#39;s money, among other things.
&quot;From mid-November 2013 to January of this year, the woman used part of the funds from her son&#39;s disability pension for her own needs and thus deprived him of 440,000 crowns,&quot; said police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová, adding that the accused woman was aggravated by the fact that, as her guardian, she had a separate deposit the obligation to defend the interests of the injured party.
According to the court&#39;s instructions, the woman set up an account for her son, but she had his pension sent to her account.
&quot;After paying the costs associated with her son&#39;s stay in a medical facility and paying for the necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds to buy a vehicle, electrical appliances and to run the household,&quot; the indictment states.
The woman admitted that she could not use her son&#39;s money for her own needs.
But she defended herself by helping them pay for family expenses.
&quot;We had problems with our income to tighten the running of the household.
We never bought anything fancy.
It was always for things the son would approve of buying.
I considered it family money.
I had no idea that I was committing a crime,&quot; the woman explained to the police.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say after finding tools
Finds from Chiquihuite Cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1,930 limestone tools, including fine blades that may have been used to cut meat, and pointed objects that may have served as spearheads or spearheads.
Scientists have found that the oldest of the tools date from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
&quot;There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here,&quot; said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies published on the subject in the journal Nature.
The youngest tools are 12,500 years old.
According to experts, people inhabited the Chiquihuite cave, located at a high altitude, for 20,000 years.
Until now, the generally accepted theory stated that the first representatives of the species Homo sapiens crossed the land bridge from the region of today&#39;s Russia to Alaska approximately 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spear points used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this herding culture subsequently spread across much of North America.
But this model has suffered cracks in recent decades, when several ancient settlements were discovered that were two to three thousand years older.
A second study published in the journal Nature describes 42 different sites across North America that prove human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people may have arrived on the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some were able to get to America by boat.
&quot;It is clear that people were in America long before the development of the so-called Clovis culture,&quot; said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn from the University of Alberta, Canada, regarding the new findings.
So far, the interest in tickets fulfills an optimistic scenario, according to sellers.
The prices are also gradually decreasing
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last summer, interest is still roughly half, but demand is growing by up to 20 percent every week.
The development after the crisis thus fulfills the most optimistic scenarios according to the sellers.
Air ticket prices are gradually decreasing.
According to the sellers, the most sought-after destinations include mainly southern European countries.
According to data from Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece are in the lead.
The Letuska.cz portal sells the most flights to Split, Croatia.
Of the other countries, Great Britain is the most popular, but it has always been one of the busiest destinations.
The average ticket price is also decreasing.
At the portal Letuška.cz, it was around 6,250 crowns in the middle of the month, 3,000 crowns less year-on-year.
This is mainly due to the increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, the prices themselves to some European places, for example to Spain or Italy, have fallen by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behavior of customers, who now buy tickets much less in advance than before, because they fear the further development of the coronavirus situation.
According to earlier information from Kiwi.com, the time to buy a ticket before departure decreased by about ten days year-on-year.
&quot;It confirms to us the future trend, when people will order tickets much less in advance, they will require more flexibility, less risk,&quot; said Kiwi.com vice president for products Michal Šindelář.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with the growth in sales, the number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic is also increasing.
Prague Airport currently operates regular flights to more than 60 destinations.
Compared to last year&#39;s summer season, this is about half of the destinations.
Grand finale tonight!
Watch the darts battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organization reached the grand finale.
It will feature the experienced forty-nine-year-old Scottish darts player Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, the twenty-six-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pipo in the first round, then ran into his neighbor in the standings.
However, he also dealt with James Wade and in the quarter-finals he had a good fight with Simon Whitlock, who previously sent home the world number one.
The &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; was almost in the semi-finals when he faced Michale Smith.
At the last moment, however, he ran away from the gravedigger, dominated the extra time and, after a score of 18:16, won a place in the finals of the tournament, which he already dominated in 2018, when he defeated Mensur Suljović 21:19 in an amazing battle.
The biggest surprise of the World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament and perhaps the knowledge that he has nothing to lose has helped him to be playing on an absolutely fantastic wave.
The twenty-six-year-old darts player surprisingly knocked out the world number six Nathan Aspinall, in a dramatic battle they overpowered Joe Cullen and in the quarter-finals, after a sharp start, he also defeated Adrian Lewis.
The semi-final was a big test.
Glen Durrant showed his strength right from the start, but the Belgian, who was playing calmly, gained a lead with an excellent series, which he kept more or less without problems until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, with which he encountered occasional uncertainty in doubles.
The number of coronavirus cases has increased at least since the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, 15,212 people have been demonstrably infected with it.
Almost 9,600 of them have already recovered, 368 patients have died.
Currently, 5,254 people are sick.
This follows from data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases exceeded two hundred four times in a row this week.
The maximum was 281 cases on Friday.
There were 235 positive tests on Thursday, 246 the day before and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first working day of this week, 169 people were infected.
9,590 people have already recovered from covid-19 in the Czech Republic, i.e. 63 percent of all those infected so far.
Most had a mild course of the disease.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, there are 151 people with the coronavirus in the hospital, the condition of 19 of them is assessed by doctors as serious.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 in the Czech Republic.
Karvinsko still has the highest number of infected people per 100,000 inhabitants over the past seven days, with almost 59.
It is followed by Jihlava district with 56 and Frýdecko-Místecko with 36 infected per 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected people, new measures against the spread of the coronavirus have been in force in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People must wear masks at indoor mass events of more than 100 people, including cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be reduced from the current thousand people to half.
In the world, the number of people who have been proven infected with the new coronavirus has already exceeded 16 million.
This was reported by the American Johns Hopkins University, which monitors the development of the pandemic globally.
According to this source, the balance of victims who died with the covid-19 disease is close to 645 thousand.
The latest million infected were added to the statistics in just three days; the 15 million mark fell on July 22.
In recent days, the largest share in the rapid increase in the number of cases was the United States, which already registers over 4.1 million infected, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where, according to the authorities, almost 1.4 million people have been infected.
The infected are now increasing at a record pace.
The World Health Organization announced this week that more than 284,000 new cases were added worldwide from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily tally since the start of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in populous countries such as the USA, Brazil and India, but according to Reuters, the number of new cases increased in almost 40 countries around the world in the past week.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium and Israel.
The disease has already appeared in almost all countries of the world, the first case was officially announced today by the DPRK.
Indoor air is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
Air fresheners and deodorants are harmful to health
Health is threatened not only by poor air quality in outdoor areas, but also at home.
This was pointed out by Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, as quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who was instrumental in creating Israel&#39;s Ministry of Environmental Protection, household pollutants need to be addressed now that many people are spending more time working from home.
Abrahamová mentioned research by the US Environmental Agency (EPA), according to which the quality of indoor air is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year due to poor air quality in their homes.
&quot;Due to the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced and continues to force many to work from home, people have to spend more hours at home than before, so it&#39;s time to focus on indoor air quality,&quot; said Abraham.
In Israel, according to her, almost no one deals with the quality of &quot;home air&quot;.
At the same time, things that a person normally comes into contact with can be dangerous - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
&quot;Even the clothes that we regularly wear to the dry cleaners release poisonous gas,&quot; said Abrahamová.
According to her, children, elderly household members and people with respiratory problems are most at risk.
Even otherwise healthy individuals can begin to suffer from problems such as headaches, fainting, irritation of the nasal passages, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergies.
Long-term exposure to unhealthy substances can damage internal organs and the central nervous system.
However, not all pollutants come from objects inside households, the source can also be the material from which the houses are built.
Quiz about Václav Havel: How long was he in prison and what made him write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada lost the chance to advance to the highest Spanish football league due to the coronavirus infection in the team.
The management of the competition canceled the originally postponed duel of the last round of the second league, in which the team could secure participation in the playoffs.
Fuenlabrada reported 12 more infected people on Saturday, bringing the total number of positive tests for covid-19 at the club to 28.
Due to an infection in the team, Monday&#39;s duel against La Coruna, in which Fuenlabrada needed a point to reach the playoffs, was postponed.
The management of the competition stated today that the duel against La Coruna was definitively called off due to force majeure due to the fact that there was no time to play it.
Fuenlabrada accepted the decision.
La Coruña, on the other hand, is protesting against not playing the match.
In the end, given the results of their rivals, even a victory over Fuenlabrada would not be enough to save them, but they consider it unfair that the last round did not take place, as usual, in a single term.
The management of the former elite Spanish club is facing a lawsuit due to the fall to the third league.
The first two teams in the table, Huesca and Cádiz, are certain of progressing among the elite.
Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche will compete for the remaining third place in the play-offs.
Karel Gott didn&#39;t like Václav Havel?!
Dominika&#39;s daughter revealed it
&quot;Dad didn&#39;t need him for many years,&quot; she revealed to Aha! Gotta Dominik&#39;s eldest daughter, with the fact that the Master could not think of Havel&#39;s name and whenever he was mentioned, Karel was said to have always been annoyed.
It&#39;s hard to say what they did to each other, but according to Dominika, the dispute started sometime in the mid-nineties.
&quot;Dad said in an article after the revolution that he had it easier than he did.
That Havel could write in his drawer in the dark times, but if he somehow disobeyed, his career would be over,&quot; says Gottová.
But then he adds that in the end the Czech greats found a way to each other after all.
&quot;I know that he could not hear the word Havel at all until his sixties.
But then the president congratulated him with a letter on his birthday and suddenly dad&#39;s relationship with him started to change,&quot; recalls Dominika.
After all, ten years later, Gott even invited the former president to celebrate his seventieth birthday at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
&quot;And there began a new era of their relationship, because dad then regularly invited Mr. Havel to his home on Bertramka,&quot; added the blonde, whose father died last October.
Slavík is also said to have regretted that he never received a state award from Václav Havel.
However, he only got it in 2009, even though it was already at the hands of his successor in office, Václav Klaus (79).
He will receive another honor in memoriam, the current president Miloš Zeman (75) is to award him the Order of the White Lion and thus honor his memory.

The meteorologist&#39;s warning against high temperatures is valid for Tuesday afternoon for the whole of Bohemia with the exception of the Karlovy Vary Region and also for South and Central Moravia.
&quot;Exceptionally, temperatures can even exceed 34 degrees Celsius, especially in central Bohemia,&quot; they state.
They advise people to follow the drinking regime in the heat and to limit physical activity in the midday and afternoon hours.

The meteorologists&#39; warning about the risk of fires applies to central Bohemia, including Prague, Liberec, Ústí, Karlovy Vary and Pilsen regions.
The fire warning will be in effect until further notice.
&quot;We don&#39;t expect more significant precipitation, which would reduce the danger, in the northwest and west of Bohemia until at least the end of the week,&quot; reports ČHMÚ.
The Prague municipality responded to the meteorologist&#39;s warning by banning bonfires in risky places, which is to apply from Tuesday.
People in the capital will not be allowed to start open fires, for example in parks, gardens or forests, up to a distance of 50 meters from the edge of the forest.
