An unusually open and unique image of Karel Gott in the feature-length documentary film by Olga Špátová
This unique film from the workshop of Olga Špátová will premiere in Czech cinemas in the spring of next year.
&quot;In the middle of September last year, Ivanka and Karel Gott called me and asked me if I would make a documentary about his life with Karel again after ten years. I didn&#39;t hesitate for a minute! Filming with a person who has lasted more than half a century at the forefront of Czech culture thanks to his exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immeasurable hard work, it was and is a great honor for me. I accepted the challenge to make a feature-length documentary film about Karl Gott, who has brought joy to three generations of listeners with his art, as a commitment to this legendary singer, &quot; director Olga Špátová describes her feelings.
Thanks to a quick arrangement and agreement, the first day of filming took place already on October 22 last year, and the last shots with Karl Gott were filmed a few days ago. The goal was and is absolutely clear - to capture authentically Karel Gott as a phenomenal singer who gives himself to his fans, as a painter, but at the same time a loving husband and father of his children. A man who for sixty years has been giving joy to several generations with his songs, not only in our country, but also in Europe, and actually all over the world. A man who has written himself into the hearts and souls of his listeners by simply being.
The film is not intended to be a parade of the indisputable fame of Karel Gott and his achievements. &quot;That&#39;s why it&#39;s not even possible to compare my previous film Phenomén Gott with this current one. Everyone is different. At least because we filmed them in a different stage of Karl Gott&#39;s life, and this is very evident in his personal, even intimate confession that he gave us and which confirmed to all of us what a legend we have the opportunity to work with and spend time with, which is truly indescribable,&quot; adds Olga Špátová.
The creators captured Karel Gott during his performances, during meetings with his fans here and in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, at a cottage in Bohemian Switzerland, in the village where he spent his childhood, and in other places that she played an important role in his life. Thanks to Karel Gott&#39;s frank openness, the film will be completely authentic and unique.
&quot;Olga has a great gift for filming with her close team in such a way that we often let ourselves be carried away by the spontaneous atmosphere and naturally let her into our privacy, thanks to which I talked about relatively intimate topics. With my husband, cameraman Jan Malíř, I actually they have become part of our family. We originally wanted to release the film in 2019, when I celebrated my life anniversary. But since I had another beautiful summer with my family, I wanted us to shoot as long as possible. Well, and since I was everywhere in 2019 , my wish was for it to be released in the spring of next year. This documentary film is a thank you to my supporters and everyone who supported and accompanied me in my profession,&quot; says Karel Gott himself about the film.
There are up to sixty times fewer insects than 40 years ago
No other animal class is more represented in nature than insects. Beetles, butterflies and other species make up more than half of all life on Earth. But there are increasing reports that the insect kingdom is radically shrinking. Another scientific study on this topic came out just this week, and according to it, the situation is even more serious than humanity has realized.
The study is based on field research in a tropical rainforest in Puerto Rico, during which American scientists copied a similar survey from 1976. As they write right at the beginning of the report, there are &quot;ten to sixty times fewer&quot; insects in the rainforest today. It is about the decline of the entire population, i.e. not the number of species, while the research concerned not only insects, but all arthropods. Due to the extinction of insects, the population of other fauna that depends on insects in the food chain, such as birds, frogs or lizards, also decreases.
The authors of the research relate their conclusions directly to climate change. According to them, the average air temperature in the forest has risen by two degrees Celsius in the last thirty years, and warming has become the driving force behind the collapse of the food chain. According to the author&#39;s team, the study shows that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much greater than previously thought.
A large article about the report was published in the Washington Post on Monday, which presents the new findings immediately in the headline as hyperalarming. &quot;It&#39;s one of the most disturbing articles I&#39;ve ever read,&quot; University of Connecticut entomologist David Wagner, whom the paper cites as an independent expert, told the paper.
The extinction of insects also affects Europe. &quot;The decline here is also an order of magnitude,&quot; points out Lukáš Čížek from the Institute of Entomology of the Academy of Sciences. According to him, in addition to climate change, it is also necessary to take into account changes in the landscape, which play a significant role in Europe. &quot;It just runs for a significantly longer time here than in Puerto Rico,&quot; adds Čížek to explain why scientists could measure such a rapid decline in the primeval forest compared to the 1970s.
Czechs in Europe Ondřej Housky: Should Czechoslovakia have rejected the Munich Agreement in 1938 and gone to war with Germany? Three times NO
The undated picture shows Adolf Hitler visiting the Czechoslovak border fortifications. The purpose of the fortresses was never to stop the German army, but to slow its advance before the Allies could engage.
If, almost exactly 81 years ago, Czechoslovakia had rejected the Munich Agreement and subsequently faced a German attack, what would have put the most Czechoslovak soldiers out of the fight? German tanks, air force, or perhaps artillery? Quite possibly it would not have been one of these weapons, even though the Germans had an overwhelming superiority in them over the Czechoslovaks. The Czechoslovak army would probably suffer the biggest losses - due to blisters.
The head of the police union, Štěpánek, has resigned, he wants to live as a free man
The chairman of the Independent Trade Union of the Police, Milan Štěpánek, has decided to leave his position. It was reported on Friday by Czech Radio - Radiožurnál. Štěpánek has led the union since 2005. He will be the president of the union for another two months. He will remain with the police even after leaving the head of the union.
&quot;I can confirm that this week I submitted my written resignation to the board, after which I will continue to perform my duties fully for another two months,&quot; Štěpánek told Radiožurnál. &quot;I decided as a free person who doesn&#39;t want to be tied to a trade union forever. And who wants to live a more peaceful life,&quot; he stated the reasons for leaving.
The independent trade union of the Police of the Czech Republic brings together members and employees of security forces and employees of the Ministry of the Interior. Among other things, the union participated in police protests against budget cuts or petitions for better conditions for the security forces. For example, in 2011 he also got into a dispute with the then Minister of the Interior, Radek John, and organized a petition for his resignation. The leadership of the governing coalition later agreed on John&#39;s departure.
The museum in Semile returns to the velvet revolution with an exhibition
An imitation of a normalization room with a television showing footage of the brutal police intervention against students on November 17, 1989 in Prague. This is also in the new exhibition of the museum in Semile, which is devoted to the velvet revolution. &quot;The basis is to present what happened in Semile after the events on Národní třída,&quot; said exhibition curator Tomáš Chvátal.
&quot;I would say that the atmosphere was basically the same everywhere, with the fact that the first demonstration was held in Semily on November 22, and then every day more people were gradually arriving,&quot; he said. Among the most active from the beginning was a group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matěcha, who was the only one from the city and the surrounding area to sign Charter 77, and the Dědečkovys, who circulated the Several Sentences petition. According to Chvátal, the Civic Forum was also created relatively quickly. &quot;One specific thing is that there was a very strong group of local doctors in the Civic Forum,&quot; said the curator.
About 50 photographs should draw visitors into the happenings in the city at that time, the pictures were taken 30 years ago by Karel Bárta. A video from the general strike on November 27, 1989, filmed by František Tomíček, has also been preserved, and it will be played on a loop throughout the duration of the exhibition. Ivan Hlas also spoke and sang at the demonstration. The Semil archive also lent a number of preserved banners from that time to the exhibition. &quot;On them was: Let&#39;s not get drunk on a roll, From trough to trough, We don&#39;t want violence,&quot; stated Chvátal. Some of the changes in the city were very fast at that time, for example already in December, people decided in a nationwide vote that the square would be Riegrovo and canceled the previous name Gottwaldovo.
The exhibition also captures the events before the November events. &quot;In the first part, we present to witnesses and students what happened before, such a late normalization. I think we managed to collect unique documents from Semil, whether they are banners with various communist slogans or a bronze plate from the museum of the workers&#39; movement at that time,&quot; said Chvátal . One room is meant to evoke the feeling of what it might have looked like in the living room of an ordinary household back then.
The last part of the exhibition is dedicated to what happened after the Velvet Revolution. It is focused on the first free elections. &quot;We wallpapered one room with election posters. Those who experienced it will remember the posters With us to Europe or Václav Klaus is still there under the banner of OF with the beautiful motto Everyone for his community,&quot; added the curator.
Hašek wants the fans to be positive. Sparta is in for a hit in Pilsen
&quot;We will play to the limit, we will do everything in our power to succeed. To win the match in terms of play and results,&quot; Spartan player Martin Hašek promised in an interview for club television.
In the week, he decided the cup duel in Jihlava with a goal (2:1). Sparta advanced to the next round, which was an obligation for them. She is relieved, but she continues to struggle with the game.
Even though the season is slowly flowing into the second third, football Sparta is still looking for the face that coach Václav Jílek talked about at the end of his engagement.
&quot;But it&#39;s still Sparta, which has very high-quality players. We have a difficult match ahead of us,&quot; warns Pilsen&#39;s Roman Procházka.
When the Spartans arrived in Štruncový sady for the last time, in mid-May, it was a definite matter in the superstructure. The guests left after a spiritless performance with a 0:4 beating, the biggest in the history of the independent Czech league.
While at that time the difference between the clubs in the table was eight points before the mutual match, Sparta is now losing nine points after ten matches of the new season. He is experiencing one of the worst starts to the season ever.
&quot;It is not an easy situation either for us or for the fans, who would like to see their beloved club completely different from what it is at the moment,&quot; feels Hašek. “But we would like them to continue to support us, stay positive and stand behind us.
Sparta does not know if they will be able to use Tetteh in Pilsen, who received a two-game suspension for the suspension in Pilsen, but appealed against it on Friday.
Costa, Dočkal, Drchal, Panák, Pulkrab, Zahustel, Krejčí and Kadlec, who is the only member of the squad who remembers the last Spartan victory in Pilsen in 2011, remain among the many dead.
The home team, who have won the last five matches, including Wednesday&#39;s cup in Hlučín, should only be missing midfielder Čermák. And as captain, defender Jakub Brabec, a Spartan native, should lead them into the match.

&quot;Scary study result.&quot; Islam does not belong to the West, the vast majority of Austrians think
1,200 respondents were interviewed, the survey shows considerable mistrust of Islam in Austrian society.
Almost 60 percent of Austrians fear that some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would demand a ban on the construction of mosques. 80 percent of respondents are in favor of greater monitoring of centers of Islam.
Most Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices, saying that the presence of Muslims sometimes makes them feel like foreigners in their own country.
&quot;The result of the study is frightening,&quot; claims the author of the study, Wolfgang Aschauer, and adds: &quot;Such a tendency towards ethnocentrism could eventually lead to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes. There is a danger that the religious freedoms granted to Muslims will be narrowed.&quot;
The critical attitude is less pronounced among believers. Aschauer claims that in Austria it is not a conflict between religions, but between cultures. According to the sociologist, dialogue and education could help blunt polarization.
According to the study, the most hostile attitudes towards Muslims are held by voters of the extreme right, people without a university education or seniors over 75 years of age. On the other hand, Green voters, people under 30 and university students are the most welcoming.
According to estimates by the Austrian Ministry of the Interior, approximately 700,000 Muslims live in Austria, which has approximately 8.7 million inhabitants. The vast majority have Turkish roots. There are more than 400 Muslim prayer houses and mosques in the country, and Islam has been officially recognized as a religion since 1912.
Thomas Cook: Czechs kicked out of a hotel in Mallorca. The guarantees were not enough
The group&#39;s Austrian, German and Polish divisions also filed for insolvency during the week. The future of the Czech branch is currently being discussed, a decision should be made by the end of September.
According to Jan Papež, vice-chairman of the Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, there are three variants of possible solutions - liquidation will be announced, or the company will be sold, or the team from the Czech branch will establish a new travel agency. &quot;Which one of them it will be, but it is impossible to predict, it will depend on the German owner,&quot; said CTK today.
In addition to two prematurely terminated tours, CK also deals with cases where clients had to pay for the stay themselves, although the company tries to provide guarantees to hoteliers. CK promised to make payments to its clients, according to Pope, the company has sufficient security for this.
Problems in hotels arose mainly in Mallorca, where the company also asked the Czech consulate for help. In this context, the Pope described to ČTK one of the cases when the local hotel kicked out all the tourists of the office. &quot;The hotelier could not determine who belongs to the German and who to the Czech company. That is why he threw everyone out of the hotel, even though the domestic Neckermann provided a guarantee,&quot; he said. According to Šrámek, the situation was finally resolved.
The Czech branch of the bankrupt British group Thomas Cook increased its sales to 995 million crowns last year, almost 21 percent more year-on-year, according to the company&#39;s annual report. It covers the accounting period from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. On the other hand, the company&#39;s net profit decreased by roughly seven million to 15.3 million crowns. However, the company had an unreimbursed loss of almost 103 million crowns from previous years. The branch includes two basic divisions - in addition to CK Neckermann, it is also Global Travel Lufthansa City Center.
Trump is considering delisting Chinese stocks in the US
The administration of US President Donald Trump is considering revoking the permission of Chinese companies to trade on stock markets in the United States. An informed source told Reuters today. Such a move would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the US and China. Shares of the companies concerned on the New York Stock Exchange immediately headed down after the news, dragging the entire market down with it.
The stock withdrawal would be part of a broader effort to limit US investment in China, the source added. He thus confirmed the report of the Bloomberg agency, which shortly before caused a shock in the financial markets. Shares of Chinese companies Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI lost between two and four percent.
According to government data from February, shares of 156 Chinese companies are traded on the US Nasdaq and NYSE exchanges. There are also at least 11 state-owned enterprises among them.
The Bloomberg agency pointed out that an exact mechanism has not yet been developed that would ensure the withdrawal of shares of Chinese companies from American stock exchanges. Any plan would have to be approved by Trump, but he gave the green light to negotiations on the matter.
China and the US have been waging a trade war for more than a year, in which they impose tariffs on each other. The dispute between the two countries has negative effects on the world economy and raises fears of a recession in the global economy. Washington is using tariffs to try to get Beijing to change its trade practices and reduce China&#39;s trade surplus with the US.
According to CNBC, trade talks between the US and China should resume on October 10. His goal is to end the trade war.
The police charged the manager of CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, due to contracts for promotion
The police charged the former manager of the state agency CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, due to contracts for promotion. Pangrác confirmed to the SeznamZprávy server that he accepted the charges this week. Czech Television (ČT) reported last year that the police officers were examining contracts worth 38 million crowns in the case. According to the police, part of the money was going back to Pangrác, the server writes. In the case, criminal investigators were also interested in Regional Development Minister Klára Dostálova (for ANO), to whose department CzechTourism falls. According to the server, the investigation into the case continues.
Detectives from the National Central Office against Organized Crime secured evidence in this case in the second half of last November. They were, for example, at the headquarters of the Ministry for Regional Development, at the headquarters of CzechTourism, at the autodrome in Most or at the Sport Invest agency. They also took the official computer from the minister&#39;s apartment. In the court order to search Dostálova&#39;s home, which was previously cited by ČT, it was stated that in 2016, when she was a deputy, the minister made decisions about the expenses of CzechTourism for the benefit of selected persons indirectly and outside of the standard official procedure. At the time, Dostálová declared that she felt absolutely innocent, that she had no doubts, that she could document everything and that she fully cooperated with the police.
According to the agency, it was the fault of an individual. The media previously reported that it was Aleš Pangrác, the former director of the regional partnership department at CzechTourism, who was dismissed due to the results of the audit. This resulted in the CzechTourism agency concluding 48 problematic contracts.
&quot;Yes, they accused me. But I don&#39;t want to comment more on that,&quot; Pangrác told Seznam Zpravy severu.
A vandal vandalized the cemetery in Dobruška
According to the report received by the police, the vandalism on the scattering meadow inside the Dobruš cemetery should have happened on Wednesday between 1 pm and 5 pm.
&quot;The material damage was estimated at 60,000 crowns. The police ask any witnesses to the event to share their knowledge in person at the office or by phone on the toll-free line 158,&quot; said police spokeswoman Lucie Konečná.
Criminal investigators are investigating the case as damage to another&#39;s property and disorderly conduct, which carries a penalty of up to three years in prison.
They freed hundreds of enslaved children from a religious school in Nigeria
According to the BBC, there were almost five hundred men and boys, Reuters, citing the police commissioner, said that there were over three hundred children aged five and over. Some were chained together, others were chained to iron rings in the wall.
Kaduna Police Chief Ali Janga told the BBC that the raid on the school was carried out on a tip-off. He called the school a house of horrors. Starving people were held there by force, tortured and sexually abused. They couldn&#39;t leave, there was razor wire over the walls. According to him, this is a case of slavery.
Several people were detained during the raid, according to police spokesman Jakubu Sabo, they were local teachers.
The children told police that their parents or relatives had taken them to the school, saying it was a religious school. &quot;We have identified two children who are from Burkina Faso, but most were brought here by their parents from the Nigerian states in the north,&quot; said spokesman Sabo on the identity of the victims. The Nigerian states in the north of the country are predominantly Muslim.
The school of Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal pretended to be a religious school focused on the study of the Qur&#39;an.
The liberated were taken to the stadium, where they are provided with help and food. Some have already met relatives.
French chef sues Michelin over star withdrawal I suffer from depression, he claims
Renowned French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star this January, a year after he won it. He intends to sue the publisher of the Red Guide to get the exact reasons for the downgrade. Veyrat also doubts the competence of the Michelin inspectors, who, according to him, confused saffron with cheddar. The first trial is scheduled to take place in November.
The chef of the famous restaurant La Maison de Bois in the Alpine region of Haute-Savoie lost one of his three Michelin stars in January of this year. The publisher of the prestigious Le Guide Michelin will be sued because, according to him, the conclusion of the commissioners was not properly justified. In addition, according to him, the star was removed without any warning. &quot;I&#39;ve been suffering from depression for six months. How dare you mess with the chefs&#39; health?&quot; Veyrat told the commissioners.
Michelin is said to have given the chef only vague reasons, such as that the chef put cheddar in the souffle, which the inspection did not like. &quot;I put saffron in it and the gentlemen thought it was cheddar because it was yellow. I have been working with Savoy ingredients with love since the beginning,&quot; Veyrat objected to the decision. He is convinced of the strong incompetence of the Michelin commissioners: &quot;You are frauds who only stir up disputes for commercial reasons.&quot; An outraged Veyrat doesn&#39;t understand &quot;how they could say we put cheddar in our souffle&quot;. &quot;They also insulted our region, my employees were mad about it. We have eggs from our own chickens, milk from our own cows, gardeners collect fresh herbs every morning,&quot; he got angry.
The distinctive chef, always with a black hat on his head and dark glasses, is an opponent of the new generation of Michelin commissioners, and that is why he is asking for his restaurant to be removed from the red guide. However, the publisher refuses. &quot;If the business remains open and our inspectors select it again, we will continue to recommend it,&quot; says Gwendal Poullennec, Michelin&#39;s international director.
According to Michelin, the chef&#39;s lawsuit shows that he does not yet have any meaningful charges and his lawyer is yet to help him formulate one. &quot;We regret that Mr. Veyrat communicates with us rudely. But we will carefully examine his comments,&quot; he said.
In addition to La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart owns two other three-star restaurants.
A technically perfect mess with a weak script. The Gemini with Will Smith did not take the criticism seriously
The dystopian sci-fi spectacle Gemini Man boasts an interesting premise - Will Smith will play a younger version of himself in the film. But according to critics, the story is the weakest part of the film. The film will be released in Czech cinemas on October 10.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is the absolute top in his field. It kills efficiently and without any unnecessary questions. But one day he decides to hang his career on a nail. Understandably, his employers don&#39;t like this, and they send another killer to Henry. The catch is that the killer is Henry himself, or rather a younger DNA clone of him. Can one determined man win the battle over himself? Literally this time.
Three-time Oscar winner Ang Lee should have been a sure guarantee of quality. Although this is his first sci-fi, he has extensive experience with dramatic action films, as he demonstrated, for example, in the above-mentioned Tiger and the Dragon or the western Riding with the Devil. Six screenwriters collaborated on the script. The most famous one is certainly David Benioff, one of the creators of the highly successful Game of Thrones. According to the first reviews, even all this was not enough for a good film.
&quot;Even though Ang Lee is trying to do great things in technical filmmaking, the film itself doesn&#39;t have enough character to make it stand out,&quot; thinks Fionnuala Hannigan of Screen Daily.
&quot;This disappointing film is less than the sum of all the talents involved in it. The weak script and plot are held together only by the technological magic of the filmmakers,&quot; summed up his opinion Stephen Dalton from The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
&quot;Gemini is a case in which a huge amount of work resulted in an incredibly lackluster action film,&quot; says Variety reviewer Peter Deburge.
&quot;A confused product born of a bizarre idea,&quot; Ella Kemp of IndieWire summed up the film in her review.
&quot;It&#39;s hard to care about one man being another man&#39;s doppelgänger when neither man is acting human,&quot; wrote Nicholas Barber of The Wrap.
Overview of bank accounts for children on the Czech market
Banks provide children&#39;s accounts free of charge. However, the offer should be considered, because some other services for the accounts are already charged. &quot;The motivation of banks to offer accounts for children, the basic management of which is usually free, is straightforward. Financial houses expect that the waived fees will be returned to them one day. Given the small migration of Czechs between banks, they are probably not wrong,&quot; says Kristýna Kuncová from dTest.
According to her, &quot;small accounts&quot; can do almost everything that adult accounts can do. The child gets his own payment card, can enter payments, monitor account movements, has his own electronic banking available somewhere. Banks will set up an account, but it is up to the parents to teach their children how to handle them and also to control their payments.
&quot;Relatively flexibly, the parent can set weekly or monthly limits, turn individual services on and off, and the like. But above all, they can monitor what is happening on the account, either by viewing it via the Internet or thanks to information SMS. Be careful, these may no longer be free.&quot; adds Kuncová and adds: &quot;If a parent is considering an account for their child, they should consider their abilities and options.&quot;
Strict but fair, we have fun for hours! This is how Benešov high school students see their favorite cantor writer
Humanism should be present in every good book, believes Pavel Hoza. A high school teacher of Czech and history is at the same time a poet, a novelist and a revivalist of literary life in a small town.
Bohuslav Reynek springs to mind over the lyrics of Pavel Hoza. His poetry, his paintings. Bare trees, white country houses, trembling grass, shepherds, sheep and goats, old roads and people who have followed them for centuries. Mourning, cursing, blessing. This contemporary successor of Reynk teaches Czech, literature and history at the gymnasium in Beneš, runs a similar Viola in Prague in the Café na slovíčko there, and organizes the Beneš literary festival every year.
Wife swapping: Ondra&#39;s parents cruelly abused! He ended up in an institution
It was nerve wracking. The allegedly troubled son Ondřej (9) was severely punished by his father every moment. &quot;He came home from school and lied with his snack. Lukáš looked at me and said he would kneel as a punishment,&quot; Lucie described in the Exchange. Dad Lukáš forced little Ondra to kneel in the corner for several hours! In addition, off-camera, he allegedly had to suffer like this on a wooden foot massage mat! &quot;Ondřej came to me after the filming and said to me - Aunt, I&#39;m only making these troubles and notes so that I won&#39;t be here, because I want to go to an institution,&quot; Lucie described the moment when she fully understood what was happening behind the studio door. And the boy&#39;s wish finally came true...
His condition was so serious that he was taken away from his family after filming and placed in the Educational Care Center in České Budějovice for a month. He briefly returned to his father and surrogate mother Aneta (28), but then went to a diagnostic institute for problem children. &quot;When I got home, Aneta immediately added me on Facebook, we wrote to each other for a while. She was most interested in whether we had received the money. I almost didn&#39;t respond to that. But then she wrote to me that the little one was in the institution, that after that they they returned him, now he is in a diagnostic clinic. They are both unemployed,&quot; says mother Lucie from Plzeňsk.
Blesk, of course, also addressed the other party, but received only a vague answer. &quot;I&#39;m not in the mood, I&#39;m sick, call me later,&quot; Aneta excused herself and hung up the phone.
Sparta does not want to lose Tetteh in Pilsen. She appealed the two-match ban
Football Sparta has appealed against the two-match ban for striker Benjamin Tetteh, which the player received from the disciplinary committee for being sent off in Sunday&#39;s derby with Slavia (0:3).
The Letenský club informed about it on its twitter and is now waiting for the appeal commission&#39;s verdict.
Tetteh already served half of his sentence in Wednesday&#39;s domestic cup match in Jihlava. Sparta is now trying to ensure that the 22-year-old Ghanaian forward can start in Sunday&#39;s 11th round first league match in Pilsen.
The situation from last October could be repeated. At that time, Olomouc appealed against the punishment for Šimon Falta, who on Thursday received a one-match suspension from the disciplinary committee for being sent off against Liberec.
The appeals committee did not have time to discuss the case, so it delayed the effectiveness of the punishment and Falta could start on Saturday, paradoxically against Sparta.
The commission finally confirmed the one-match suspension for the midfielder from Olomouc the following week, and Falta missed the following duel with Zlín.
The disciplinarian suspended Tetteh for a foul on Slavist David Hovorka, for which he received a straight red card from referee Miroslav Zelinka in the 82nd minute.
The alleged spitting of the Ghanaian player on the opponent&#39;s captain Tomáš Souček was not proven.
The Germans elected Keller as the head of the football association
As expected, Fritz Keller, the current head of Bundesliga Freiburg, became the new chairman of the German Football Association. The 62-year-old winemaker, gastronome and hotelier was elected unanimously for a three-year term, he had no opponents.
In the position, Keller replaced Reinhard Grindel, who resigned in April due to an affair with undeclared income. His other predecessors, Theo Zwanziger and Wolfgang Niersbach, will go on trial for possible bribery in the 2006 World Cup bid.
Keller said one of the main goals will be to restore confidence in the union and lead it out of crisis. &quot;It won&#39;t be a one-man show, many people will bear the responsibility. The union is better than its reputation,&quot; said Keller, who presented all his tasks under the slogan: Together we can do it.
After being elected head of the union, Keller left his position in Freiburg.
There was a fire in the underground ČSA mine in Karviná, no one was injured
There was a fire in the underground of the ČSA Mine in Karviná this morning. The cause of the fire is not yet known. However, no one was injured, Ivo Čelechovský, a spokesman for the mining company, told ČTK.
The fire broke out at 04:25 in the casing at a depth of about 1,200 meters. &quot;Nothing happened to any of the employees, no one was injured. Ban rescuers immediately intervened on the scene, extinguished the fire with direct intervention and also carried out an inspection of the terrain. The workplace was immediately closed and made inaccessible,&quot; said the spokesperson. The exact cause of the fire will now be investigated by a special commission.
In the former Ostrava-Karvina district, coal is now mined only in the Karvina part, namely in the ČSA, Lazy, Darkov, ČSM-North and ČSM-South mines. Mining at Dole Lazy should end this year, and the other mines are also expected to gradually slow down. Mining company OKD is the only producer of black coal in the Czech Republic, its production last year was 4.62 million tons. 9,000 people work in the mines.
Berlin responds to public pressure and solves the housing crisis. They will buy 6,000 apartments from a private company
Berlin will buy from the private Luxembourg company ADO Properties SA for 920 million euros (23.8 billion CZK) 6,000 former social apartments that the city sold 15 years ago. In this way, he responds to the pressure of the public, who are rebelling against skyrocketing rental prices. According to Berlin senator Katrin Lompscher for the Left Party (Die Linke), this is the largest such buyout in the history of the German capital. The opposition criticizes the move.
&quot;The intention is to keep rents stable in Berlin and give tenants security,&quot; Berlin Mayor Michael Müller (SPD) said in a statement. &quot;At the same time, we will continue the construction of new apartments and we will legally treat the freezing of rents,&quot; he added. The municipal company Gewobag will take over the thousands of apartments located in the Spandau and Reinickendorf districts in the western part of the city this December.
According to Jefferies analyst Thomas Rothäusler, the city bought too much. Rothäusler told Bloomberg that, according to his estimate, the housing units overpaid by about ten percent over their book value.
According to the German opposition party Liberals (FDP), the Berlin authorities are contributing to real estate speculation. The FDP said it on Twitter on Friday. The protest party Alternative for Germany (AfD) called the move a &quot;waste of money&quot;.
As early as mid-July, Gewobag got back 670 apartments in Berlin&#39;s Karl-Marx-Allee street, the weekly Der Spiegel recalled on its website. The council did not disclose the price at the time. The dispute over apartments on the former GDR-era exhibition street was accompanied by protests and filled the front pages of the German press. It has become a symbol of the plight of tenants in large German cities, the newspaper wrote.
At the same time, the German metropolis used to be famous for its low cost of living and low rents. In recent years, however, it has gained in attractiveness. According to AFP, rent prices have doubled over the past ten years, making it difficult for some residents to find affordable housing.
Nokia is suing the Brno company over the name Lokia. Moravians believe that people will not mistake us
Nokia filed objections to the application of the trademark Lokia to the Industrial Property Office. However, according to CCV, product confusion is unlikely.
The Brno company developing CCV software is facing legal action from the Finnish telecommunications equipment manufacturer Nokia. Finns don&#39;t like that the Brno-based company&#39;s warehouse management program is called Lokia WMS, the E15 newspaper wrote. Nokia therefore filed objections to the application of the Lokia trademark to the Industrial Property Office. CCV judges that confusion is not likely.
Marketing director Petr Ondrášek said that two dozen customers are already using the program, it has been on the market since last September.
&quot;The Nokia brand is recognized and trusted around the world. When someone attempts to register a mark that we believe may lead to confusion or dilution of our brand, we take steps to protect our valuable asset,&quot; Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant said.
The developers from Brno claim that they did not think of the brand famous in the past for mobile phones when creating the warehouse program. According to the CCV, Loki&#39;s designation is based on the Latin name for a type of dragonfly, whose rapid movement is supposed to be analogous to the movement of storekeepers around a warehouse.
&quot;On the Czech market, the possibility of substitution is unlikely. We sell modern cloud software, which companies use to equip their warehouse operations, and we are not really moving into the field of mobile phone production. And we are not interested in being compared to a brand that may be losing steam in its field,&quot; he responded in E15 CCV manager Tomáš Kormaňák.
CCV filed for trademark protection with the Industrial Property Office in August before the program was launched. &quot;She applied for protection for products and services belonging to class 9, 35 and 42, as the software belongs to class 9, the related services of managing business activities in the warehouse belong to class 35 and the development of computer software to class 42 according to the international classification,&quot; said Ondrášek.
Nokia&#39;s objection is based on the fact that Nokia&#39;s earlier trade mark is valid in all classes of goods and services and thus covers the widest possible range of goods and services, and thus of course also overlaps in classes 9, 35 and 42. &quot;CCV does not challenge the claim the objector, if it is a matter of agreement on these classes of products and services. In reality, however, these are completely different brands aimed at other target groups,&quot; said Ondrášek.
According to E15, a trademark dispute can last months and complicate the company&#39;s operations.
Sydney to London in four hours? A possible reality in 2030
The Saber combines a classic aircraft engine with a rocket engine. It is designed to propel the aircraft at twice the speed at which the Concordes flew. &quot;Once the Saber engine is up and running, it could allow us to fly to Australia in about four hours,&quot; Turnock said. And, for example, the distance between London and New York could be covered by an airplane in one hour.
Server Independent notes that so-called hypersonic flights, in which five times the speed of sound are exceeded, are complicated by engine overheating. But the Saber (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) should deal with this problem thanks to the use of super cold helium, which should prevent the temperature from rising.
&quot;The most important thing about the Saber is that it is a hybrid of a rocket and an aircraft engine, which is powered by a stream of exhaust gases created from the air,&quot; says Shaun Driscoll of Reaction Engines. &quot;Rockets haven&#39;t evolved that much in the last 70 years, while airplanes have. So when you combine the engines, you can have a very light and efficient propulsion system and you basically create a space plane,&quot; he added.
The engine is currently being tested, with test flights expected to begin around the middle of next year. Commercial flights then around 2030.
Kovosvit sells the administrative building and other halls. He expects worse times
Due to restructuring, Kovosvit ended last year with a consolidated loss of 100 million crowns, the consolidated turnover was 1.3 billion. Among the main problems of last year, Kuchar ranks the lack of workers and shifts of subcontractors. This year, the demand for machine tools fell by 10 to 20 percent year-on-year. &quot;This is also related to the expected decrease in turnover of the order of ten percent,&quot; said the CEO. In 2017, Kovosvit had sales of 1.3 billion crowns and a profit after tax of 40.1 million. The loss for 2016 was 719 million.
Kovosvit now offers for sale several properties, halls and plots of land that it either does not use or only uses minimally. This also applies to the administrative building, where two of the five floors are used, and not completely. &quot;Part of the long-term restructuring plan is to slim down Kovosvit, to make its operations more efficient. The sale of assets is not part of any momentary solution, whether it is for example cash-flow, but part of a long-term plan where we want to devote all resources to investment development,&quot; said the CEO.
Kovosvit exports roughly half of its production. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, last year to a lesser extent Asia. This year Kuchař ranks among the most interesting India, where Kovosvit won an order for machines enabling five-axis machining worth 100 million crowns. This year, the company also exported two five-axis machines for 30 million crowns to China. &quot;Another order of the same volume is under discussion, which we would like to fulfill before the end of the year,&quot; said Kuchař. In the Russian market and elsewhere, Kovosvit faces restrictions due to sanctions.
Last year, the company sold two five-axis machining centers to France, a company that is a subcontractor to Airbus. She delivered another machine this May, and she should deliver another one at the end of the year or at the end of 2020.
The company&#39;s main investment this year was the transition of heating from steam to hot water for 20 million crowns. Kovosvit employs 500 people, the average worker&#39;s wage is 28,500 crowns. The company is looking for casting grinders for the foundry, machinists, turners and electricians.
The company has been owned by industrialist and armorer Jaroslav Strnad since September 2016. The company has a tradition in the production of machine tools. It was founded by Tomáš Baťa in 1939. At one time, the company had up to three thousand employees.
Milan Jakubů: The army stole the funeral for themselves! Says Andor Sándor
There is still confusion surrounding the funeral of Brigadier General Milan Jakubů. The media speculated during the week that the army planned the final farewell to the deputy director of Military Intelligence, despite the wishes of the family, to be bombastic, as only soldiers can. There were also discrepancies regarding the date of the funeral. The spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, Jan Pejšek, denied this.
&quot;It&#39;s nonsense! We&#39;ve been in contact with the family from the beginning, the agreed-upon Friday date of the funeral has been valid since the beginning, no one has changed it. Just like military honors are valid. We&#39;ll just deal with the possible participation of the media in consideration of the family,&quot; Pejšek told Blesk on Wednesday. The funeral will finally take place on Friday, and all military honors, including a flyover of fighter jets, will not be missing.
There is still a tense atmosphere surrounding the final farewell to the popular general. People who worked with the general in the past will not participate in the funeral ceremony due to the decision of the organizers!
This is, for example, the former head of military intelligence Andor Šándor (62), who met Milan Jakubů 17 years ago. Sándor remembers his former colleague as a hardworking, intelligent and &quot;good guy&quot;.
In addition, he regularly met with him in recent years at the anniversary celebrations of the founding of Military Intelligence. That is why he would like to say goodbye to Milan Jakubů. &quot;I personally would go to Milan Jakubů&#39;s funeral,&quot; Šándor told Bleska. But he can&#39;t.
&quot;I also know other people from the organization who would like to go, but they are unlucky because the potentates are usurping the funeral for themselves. I think it is not right to privatize the funeral in this way,&quot; said the security expert. He doesn&#39;t even like the supposedly considered closure of the ceremony to the public due to the secrecy of the army&#39;s top brass.
&quot;The leadership of the army is not secret, and the leaders of the military intelligence are not either, because they are promoted at Prague Castle, we see them there. If the media information is true and the family really let the army back it up, it is of course a matter for the family. I personally would never admit, for the army to overcome the family and its wishes,&quot; Sándor concluded.
Milan Jakubů died in a car accident near Špindlerův Mlýn on Saturday. The head-on collision between the Milan Rapid and the Ford Mustang was allegedly caused by the sports car driver Vojtěch Ch. (31).
The amateur racer was supposed to go in the opposite direction in the corner, Milan Jakubů apparently had no chance to prevent the collision. His wife (47) suffered serious injuries in the accident and it is possible that she will suffer the consequences for the rest of her life. The police questioned the culprit of the accident on Thursday.
Jan Šindelář&#39;s comment: Managing railways as a company
Heaven&#39;s election, although apparently not completely smooth, is the culmination of a sad story about the inability of the state to give a clear direction to the roads. The board of directors has been incomplete for over a year, and even after Wednesday evening, that did not change, as one of the members resigned. The provisional lasts.
The selection procedure itself was a farce from the beginning, already because the requirements for candidates, especially in the field of practice, were significantly eased. Compared to last year&#39;s selection, the requirements for the size of the company in which the candidate was supposed to work in the past have been reduced. At first, the members of the selection committee and then the supervisory board only played the role of pimps.
Nebeský probably presented the weakest professional resume of the five finalists, yet without experience from a large company, he beat experienced fighters from the management of logistics giants and transport companies. The participation of interesting managers from the private sector was probably the brightest side (and the greatest hope) of the whole process. Today, those in question already know that they only played the role of narrative backdrops in a political game.
Maybe Nebesky will surprise, show great talent and end up being the best lane boss ever. At least in the beginning, however, it will be accompanied by the aftertaste of political tabloids. České dráhy does not have an easy time ahead, they have to cope with competition during the liberalization of the market and with a lack of employees in operation. Train drivers, shifters and mechanics are missing. What motivation are they supposed to have for further work and respect for management when the state behaves like an elephant in china in the top management?
The second important group are creditors. We will see how they interpret the games at the head of the railways next spring, when the railways defend their rating. What is certain is that lenders perceive instability. It is sad that every year someone else goes to the Moody&#39;s agency to defend the rating on behalf of Czech Railways. The agency did not miss the frequent changes in railway management and the political influence on the company, it criticized them already this summer.
Among other things, the ANO movement is coining the slogan that the state must be managed like a company. For a start, it would be enough if one large state-owned company was managed as a company, and not as a state. Czech Railways is still one of the largest companies in the country, and it would be good if it were led by the best. They reported, but the state despised them. It can certainly be argued that the post at the head of the railways has always been a political matter. But then we can forgive ourselves the antics with the selection process.
The couple wrapped the bitch in tape and drowned her in the river, the children found the bag
The case took place at the end of July in the village around Valašské Klobouky. A twenty-seven-year-old woman brought home a one- to two-year-old donated dog that she wanted to take care of. But her ten years older partner didn&#39;t like that she was a bitch, so he decided to get rid of her.
&quot;He wrapped the animal in duct tape and rope and largely eliminated its vocalization. He placed the dog in a jute bag, which he tied. Then they took the animal together to the river, where they threw it in the bag. The moment the dog was thrown into the water, the dog was demonstrably alive.&quot; said Zlín police spokeswoman Monika Kozumplíková.
The next day, children playing by the river found a jute bag on the bank. When they opened it, they discovered the body of a dead dog inside. They therefore called out to a woman who was passing by and ran away. The woman reported the incident to the police emergency line 158.
&quot;Thanks to the knowledge of the residents of the town, the police found out who is probably the perpetrator of this incredible act. And they were not wrong. Both the man and the woman confessed to the crime and described how the event took place,&quot; the police spokeswoman added.
An expert statement from the field of veterinary medicine confirmed that the dog died in an unmistakable agonizing manner as a result of suffocation, where the animal suffered for several minutes before death.
&quot;The actions of the perpetrators undoubtedly show a clear intention to get rid of the animal at all costs in this reprehensible way, even if they could donate or sell the dog. The criminal police commissioner from Zlín accused the pair of committing the crime of animal cruelty committed as an accomplice. Both accused persons, who have not yet been punished, could sentenced to spend up to three years behind bars,&quot; noted Kozumplíková.
Thank you for the dance! Singer Leonard Cohen&#39;s last album will be released posthumously
The album Thanks for the Dance will contain unreleased material and various musical collaborations put together by the singer&#39;s son. The album will be released on November 22.
In October 2016, the album You Want it Darker was released, on which Cohen collaborated with his son Adam. He asked him to help him finish each song. In the intimate recording, Cohen symbolically comes to terms with impending death. He died a month after the album&#39;s release at the age of 82.
Seven months later, Adam Cohen began working on the materials left by his father. He invited a whole range of musicians to collaborate - Damien Rice, Bryce Dessner, Javier Mas or the singer Beck at random.
&quot;When we came up with the music for my father&#39;s words, we used his own distinctive musical techniques. So he&#39;s still with us,&quot; said Adam Cohen about the album. &quot;What amazes me most about him are the reactions of those who have already heard him. One by one they say that Leonard is still alive,&quot; he added.
The first song of the album is the short song The Goal. &quot;I&#39;m almost alive, I&#39;m almost home,&quot; Cohen sings in his signature honey voice. He sang about death, he suspected that he would not live to release new material. He also admitted this in an interview with The New Yorker magazine a month before his death. &quot;I&#39;m ready to die. I hope it won&#39;t be too unpleasant,&quot; he declared.
In September 2018, Adam Cohen published a collection of his father&#39;s poetry called The Flame. It will be published in Czech under the title Plamen on December 31 by Argo publishing house.
The first Miss Christová finally came to her senses: She lost a few kilos and immediately looked through
The first modern Miss from 1989, Ivana Christová (49), had problems with being overweight for many years, which caused her not only physical problems, but especially psychological ones. She suffered from the fact that she had changed a lot since the days of Miss Czechoslovakia. But now it seems that she took those criticisms to heart and went into battle with the extra pounds. Even if it&#39;s a long shot.
She used to be a first-class beauty who conquered even Paris. But thirty years have passed since then, and Ivana Christová can only remember the beauty contest. Not only because of the fame, but also because of how thin she was.
Over time, she decided not to obey the strict modeling rules, which ordered her to be as slim as possible and often not to eat. She decided to stop listening and started indulging in whatever she wanted.
But she went from hunger strikes to overeating, which immediately affected her figure. In addition, she tried to disguise the extra pounds with various loose clothing, which added dimension to her curvaceous shapes.
Now it seems that Ivana has really gone into herself. She visibly lost weight, began to dress tastefully and according to her fuller figure.
At the launch of the book by Miloš Zapletal (75), she surprised everyone present that she looked through again and already has back the features of the charming brunette who entered history in 1989 not only as the first winner of Miss after the revolution, but also because of the controversy her victory caused.
Christová will forever be the first winner of the beauty pageant, but also the very first one at whom the audience in the Palace of Culture and Sports in Ostrava whistled as if they were deprived of their senses when she put on the crown.
&quot;A travesty of justice.&quot; Scientist warned of cancer from pollution, sits in Turkish base
Between 2011 and 2015, Sik participated with other scientists in a study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Health. It concluded that pollution of water, soil and food in some industrial areas in the west of the country was linked to an increased incidence of cancer in local residents.
The scientists mentioned in particular the Dilovasi industrial zone, which is located about 80 kilometers from Istanbul, and where a number of chemical and metallurgical plants are located. According to them, people living in its vicinity suffer from cancer much more often than the international average.
Erdogan is taking revenge for the coup, despite international criticism
It seemed to Sika that despite the clear conclusions of the study, the government was not taking any action on the matter. He therefore wrote several articles about the research for the opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet. The authorities subsequently started prosecuting him for divulging classified information.
&quot;The study clearly showed the extent to which water sources were contaminated with toxic substances,&quot; Sik told reporters after the verdict. &quot;The court&#39;s decision shows that the results of studies that directly concern public health can be concealed. This is unacceptable,&quot; the scientist added.
&quot;Instead of pursuing whistleblowers through the courts, the Turkish authorities should investigate this significant public health issue,&quot; said Andrew Gardner of AI Turkey.
Environmental and human rights organizations have long accused the Turkish government of failing to enforce environmental regulations despite rapid industrial development in certain regions.
After a failed coup in 2016, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan&#39;s regime launched a sweeping wave of arrests. Almost 80,000 people are now behind bars, including a number of Cumhuriyet newspaper employees. The authorities also placed 150,000 civil servants and members of the armed forces out of service or outright dismissed.
The opposition and human rights organizations accuse the government of using the coup attempt to persecute its opponents. But the authorities defend themselves by saying that these are measures necessary to ensure national security.
The fastest man on the planet missed the tests. I don&#39;t take anything, he defends himself
The traditionally much-watched fight for the fastest man on the planet will be the hunt for defending silver medalist Christian Coleman at the World Championships. The 23-year-old American is the leader of the world charts with a time of 9.81 seconds and has only lost once this year. However, his start at the top of the season was in jeopardy due to the case of missed doping tests.
The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case in early September without filing charges due to formal reasons. Coleman did not pass three doping tests last year and this year, but not within 12 months. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) dated his first offense back to April 1, 2018, i.e. to the beginning of the second quarter, but he missed the test itself only on June 6. And because the third omission occurred on April 29, 2019, Coleman was not guilty of three missed checks in 12 months.
Coleman argued that he simply forgot to update the data on the app about the athletes&#39; whereabouts. &quot;I don&#39;t take drugs, I don&#39;t take anything legal. A lot of athletes use legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster recovery. And I don&#39;t take anything, I work hard and that&#39;s it,&quot; he said before the start of the WC.
He suffered the only defeat out of six starts this year at the 100 at the start of the season at the Diamond League in Shanghai, where compatriot Noah Lyles surpassed him by just six thousandths of a second. He used Coleman&#39;s absence to triumph in the Diamond League final, but will only run the 200 at the World Cup.
On paper, the second fastest competitor is the 22-year-old Nigerian Divine Oduduru with a performance of 9.86, but he has only been successful in American university competitions so far.
The 37-year-old American Justin Gatlin, who flashed a time of 9.87 in Stanford in June, will defend the title. However, he ran the last 100 in Zagreb in just 10.29, because he slightly injured his hamstring.
South African Akani Simbine, three-time Olympic medalist from Rio Andre de Grasse and European champion Zharnel Hughes are also among the favorites. The fastest Jamaican is 2011 world champion Yohan Blake with a time of 9.96.
The men&#39;s 100 will start on Friday with the preliminary round and heats. The semi-finals and finals are scheduled for Saturday. The medal race will take place at 21:15 CEST.
Plane crash near Žinkov in Pilsen region: Two people did not survive the accident
Two people were traveling in the plane, a man (†63) and a woman (†38). &quot;The plane asked for permission to land at the Chaloupky near Klatov airport at half past eight in the evening,&quot; police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová said. That was also the last record, at that time according to the GPS coordinates it should have been near Vojovice near Žinkov.
However, it did not arrive at the Klatovsk airport. The search for the lost plane, which had sent an emergency signal, began immediately. &quot;In addition to the police, a military helicopter was also involved,&quot; said police spokeswoman Martina Korandová. But the search did not have a happy ending.
In the forest near Petrovice near Měčín, which is about six kilometers from the place where the plane last reported, before nine o&#39;clock in the morning the helicopter crew noticed the wreckage. &quot;We found the plane and two bodies without signs of life,&quot; confirmed Korandová.
The crashed machine remained partially wedged in tree branches, pieces also fell on the ground in the vicinity. &quot;We will investigate the cause of the accident in cooperation with experts and employees of the Institute for Professional Investigation of the Causes of Aviation Accidents,&quot; added Korandová.
Civilization on borrowed time
Recently, I remembered a beautiful &quot;message&quot; from one of Šimek&#39;s great stories with Grossmann, which takes place partly in a cemetery, which goes like this: &quot;I warned her that she cries well, but on someone else&#39;s grave!&quot; It occurred to me that many world politicians engaged in the senseless fight against climate change are behaving very similarly now.
They act as if humans rule planet earth. In reality, we are just a speck on her surface, which she can blow away with her immense powers like a strong gust of wind a candle flame. Probably few of them watch the famous British and American science documentaries discussing the destructive capabilities of our blue ball. After all, it would be enough for one of the larger active volcanoes to really &quot;crack up&quot; and our advanced civilization would be ruined.
And it is highly likely to happen in the near future. According to leading volcanologists, a number of large volcanoes are &quot;charged and unlocked&quot; (for example, Katla in Iceland).
In a way, it would be ideal if that eruption, if it had to happen, happened as soon as possible. Even before trillions of dollars are wasted on measures aimed at reducing the production of carbon dioxide, because any really angry volcano can release it, together with dust and poisonous volcanic gases, into the atmosphere at least a hundred times more than was saved at the expense of the inhabitants of Europe.
It therefore makes no sense to forcefully limit CO2 production. In addition, it has been scientifically proven that with its significantly higher proportion in the air, plants form more biological matter and are also more resistant to drought. For humanity, possible warming is significantly more favorable than, for example, a rapid return of the ice age.
If we realize the influence of the solar cycles on the Earth&#39;s climate, which has not yet been sufficiently explored, we have to come to only one reasonable conclusion: Let us try hard to keep the Earth as clean as possible, and let us try to adapt to other changes, which we cannot cope with forcefully, with the least possible expense!
The repair of the Krkonoše Museum will be delayed by a year
The Administration of the Krkonoše National Park (KRNAP) has moved the deadline for submitting bids for the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše Museum in Vrchlabí by three weeks. The original date for opening the envelopes was September 20, said national park spokesman Radek Drahný. The reason for the postponement of the deadline for submission of tenders is the reduction of the budget from 110 million crowns to 83 million crowns.
&quot;We are currently working with the prices that are on the market. There has been a change in the budget, this is the price we expect to be offered. If someone submits an offer that is acceptable, then the work will start as soon as possible,&quot; said Drahný .
Compared to the original plans, the start of the renovation of the museum has been delayed by about a year. KRNAP wanted to have a selected contractor for the construction part by the end of last year and start construction work this spring. According to the management of the national park, the European subsidy of 123 million crowns for the project is not at risk.
The KRNAP administration is unable to select a construction company to repair the museum. The second competition was announced this summer, because in the previous tender all the offers of the companies significantly exceeded the expected price of 65 million at the time. The offers exceeded 100 million crowns.
The museum, which is located in the former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the KRNAP Administration, has been closed since autumn 2017. The selected company should provide the construction part of the project. The total costs, including the construction of a new exhibition, are estimated at 210 million crowns. The KRNAP visitor center should be created in the now cleared building by the end of 2021 after the transformation of the exhibits.
The renovated museum with a new interactive exhibition, which should be the story of nature and people settled in the mountains and follow on from the successful exhibition Stone and Life, should serve as a representative gateway for visitors to the Giant Mountains. The visitor center should provide information about the past and present of the Krkonoše Mountains in the most understandable form and motivate people to explore the mountains and protect them. It should also take over the role of a traditional museum. The center will also offer opportunities to organize concerts, festivals, theater performances or lectures in the open air. The plans include the construction of a new entrance to the building, the creation of a research room or a cafe.
Toyota still believes in hydrogen, preparing the second generation Mirai car
The Toyota Mirai was never meant to be just a concept. Toyota was so serious about it that even though there was practically no hydrogen pumping infrastructure in the world, it still put it on the menu. So not completely standard, the customer really had to go specifically for this car, but no one else offered such a variant at the time.
Toyota boss Takeshi Uchiyamada confirmed at an international hydrogen conference that a new generation will arrive next year. Toyota still believes that these cars have a future and within ten years they will be equal in price to hybrids. Of course, this is connected with the development of pumping networks. But the future is as much about hydrogen as it is about electricity.
At the conference, the word hydrogen was often associated with the needs of ecological operation, not of passenger cars, but on the contrary of large tractors, ships, trains, etc. Simply those means of transport that need to cover long distances for a single refueling. Pure battery versions cannot offer that. Toyota could thus find new markets thanks to its extensive experience and long development.
It remains to be remembered that, just like Toyota, Hyundai also believes in hydrogen propulsion, which now also offers the Nexo hydrogen crossover.
Strawberry, plum and invisible. Choose the right shade of lipstick: There&#39;s not just one red
When choosing a red lipstick, you should first determine whether you are a warm or cool type. Try a simple test - look at the veins on your wrist. If they are blue, you are a cold type, if they are green, then you are a warm type. When choosing a new red lipstick, the first thing to do is sort it by undertone. Pay attention to the texture in the next one.
If you belong to women with a cold undertone, then purple, plum, cherry or mauve lipsticks are suitable for you.
If you fall into the warm skin undertone category, choose such lipsticks as well. You can recognize them by the fact that they gravitate towards orange, coral, gold or brown highlights.
You may find that some veins appear green and others appear blue. In that case, congratulations - you don&#39;t have to look at the undertone and you can only focus on your color preferences.
Purposeful defamation? The Ústí Zoo is looking for a new veterinarian, no one is interested
Most recently at the end of this month. The city administration attributes this to the rumors that have spread around the former zoo director and veterinarian Václav Poživil, that he purposely killed the exotic animals he cared for. For example, it was a female rhinoceros Zamba, an elephant Kalu or an orangutan Nyunáka.
The city council therefore announced a new contract. &quot;For veterinary care for the zoo with an estimated cost of 3.5 million crowns without VAT and for the city&#39;s Center for Animals in Need with an estimated cost of 2.8 million crowns without VAT,&quot; explained city spokeswoman Romana Macová.
Deputy Mayor Věra Nechybová (UFO) explained that this is the third time the city has announced a competition for veterinary services. &quot;Doctor Poživil had to explain the unfounded suspicions. I consider it a blatant dishonor of such a quality expert,&quot; she noted.
According to her, there are very few experts specializing in exotic animals. &quot;It is definitely not pleasant. The zoo currently provides veterinary care in the form of orders,&quot; she said. Orders and contract cost the same money. &quot;However, the garden must comply with the law on public contracts in terms of financing,&quot; explained zoo spokeswoman Nikola Roštejnská.
Václav Poživil himself is among the recognized experts. For example, he took part in a unique operation in which Jane, the cheetah from the mouth of the mouth, was the first cheetah in the world to receive a total endoprosthesis. He served as director of the zoo from 2009 to 2012. He did not comment on the anonymous slander about him. He did not answer phone calls or respond to SMS text messages yesterday.
As for the order for the zoo, some vets believe that the zero interest in it is not necessarily a concern about similar purposeful accusations, as in his case, but simply a lack of awareness. For example, Ústí veterinarian Jiří Král has not yet heard of her. &quot;This is the first time I&#39;ve heard from you. No one has approached us. I think this kind of thing will spread quickly,&quot; he added.
Line D will be overseen by a new metro architect, she brings experience from the London underground
The Prague transport company has chosen an architect who will oversee the shape of the metropolitan metro. From October, Anna Švarc will become her, her primary task will be the appearance of the new line D, but she will also be in charge of the existing stations. According to her, the metro cannot be viewed only as a transport structure, traveling underground should also bring an aesthetic experience.
The Czech architect, who participated, for example, in the reconstruction of three London Underground stations, won a tender issued by the Prague Transport Company (DPP).
In addition to her, 14 other bidders participated in the tender. &quot;Part of the selection process was a motivational letter and a CV. Apparently my previous experience in London, where I created a kind of aesthetic manual for the local metro in a team of three, made the decision,&quot; explains the new metro architect. In the same way, according to her, her experience from the Institute of Planning and Development in Hl. city of Prague.
He does not see the metro only as a functional transport structure. Stations should also have an aesthetic value.
&quot;I have ideas about how the metro will change, how the space will be improved. But I will find out how it will actually take place in the coming weeks, when the transport company introduces me to its ideas,&quot; says Švarc.
&quot;It is not a series of dogmas, but rather recommendations, the main goal of which is to maintain the context of all stations in the event that they are reconstructed,&quot; the design manual explains.
Whether a similar tool is also a way to improve public space in the Prague metro is a question. The Prague metro is specific. &quot;I don&#39;t really know yet whether the manual is ideal, or whether some personality can cover it,&quot; Švarc concludes.
The former French president Chirac will be buried on Monday, the public piet will be on Sunday
The funeral of former French president Jacques Chirac, who died on Thursday at the age of 86, will take place on Monday evening at the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris. This is reported by the French media with reference to Chirac&#39;s family. The ceremony will be private.
The public will be able to say goodbye to the former head of state on Sunday afternoon during a piet at the Paris Invalides, where the casket with Chirac&#39;s remains will be displayed, the Elysee Palace announced.
Crowds of people have been pouring into the presidential palace since Thursday evening, according to AFP, to sign the condolence book. This will be possible until Sunday. On Monday, President Emmanuel Macron declared national mourning.
In the meantime, other reactions are coming from the world and from France to the death of the former mayor of Paris and president from 1995 to 2007, whom today Prime Minister Édouard Philippe described as &quot;French in the true sense of the word&quot;.
For example, Chirac was remembered by the Japanese, as the politician was known for his love for their country and the sport of sumo. The news of the death of the former French president appeared on the front pages of all Japanese newspapers, including sports ones, the French press notes.
The tribal art museum on Paris&#39;s Quai Branly, which Chirac founded, will not charge admission for ten days in honor of the former head of state.
The opening of Pumpkin World delayed the ripening of pumpkins
Nová Ves u Leštiny (Havlíčkobrod Region) - The estate in Nová Ves u Leštiny in the Havlíčkobrod region opened Pumpkin World today for more than a month. Huge orange pyramids dominate the decorations made of thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins. The fall event, which is becoming a tradition, starts a week later this year, because the pumpkins in the Pipk family&#39;s seven hectares of fields have matured longer. There are still a lot of them in the field, Jaroslava Pipková told ČTK today.
The Pipks grow many kinds of pumpkins, but the weather hasn&#39;t been kind to them in the last two years. This year&#39;s harvest was delayed and some varieties did not come out. &quot;As usual, we have enough orange pumpkins for Halloween, but some varieties for connoisseurs did not succeed,&quot; said Pipková. Nevertheless, you can choose from several types at the farm, from the already mentioned large pumpkins suitable for carving and gouging decorations, to cooking Hokkaido or elongated &quot;spaghetti&quot; pumpkins, to decorative pumpkins of various colors and shapes.
Growing pumpkins is hard work. Farmers dig up the plants by hand and harvest their fruits, cutting the pumpkin from the stem with scissors. Pumpkin World has been open to Pipko regularly since 2010, previous editions have attracted thousands of people. Decorations made of pumpkins are complemented by attractions made of straw or a maze made of logs. Visitors will also see animals raised on the farm. It will be open daily until November 3.
Details about the event are on the farm&#39;s website, where the growers also offer some recipes for pumpkin dishes, such as pumpkin muffins or juice. The visitors themselves tell them about other options for preparing pumpkin in the kitchen. &quot;A lot of cooks have tried their recipes, and we get inspired,&quot; said Pipková. She pointed out that some housewives also pickle pumpkins like pickles.
The ministry is planning a flat-rate meal plan from 2021. Nothing changes in terms of taxes
The MoF is preparing an amendment to the Income Tax Act, according to which the employee would receive money for meals directly. According to the Ministry of Finance, even a quarter of the employees, i.e. about a million people who do not yet receive food stamps, will receive meal support.
According to the Chairman of the Association of Voucher System Operators, David Rýc, however, even a number of small companies that do not have a canteen or meal vouchers provide meals for their employees, for example by importing food or by making an agreement with restaurants.
&quot;The essence of the plan is that we are not changing anything about the tax benefit. Furthermore, health and social insurance will not be paid from it,&quot; Schillerová said on Friday. She added that the limit for the employer&#39;s maximum contribution applicable as a tax discount would also be maintained.
The Income Tax Act allows companies to reimburse a maximum of 55 percent of the price of the meal ticket. The remaining part is paid by the employees, in some cases the employer also pays them, but without a tax discount. The most favorable value of the meal voucher for employees and employers this year is CZK 123.
Přindiš, Prskavec and Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the WC
Kayakers Vít Přindiš and Jiří Prskavec and canoeist Tereza Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Water Slalom Championship in Seu d&#39;Urgell. Přindiš was fourth in Friday&#39;s qualification, Prskavec fifth and Fišerová eighth. The next three Czech representatives will be aiming for a semi-final start in Spain in the afternoon corrective qualifying run.
From the strong representative group of kayakers, Vavřinec Hradilek failed, as he received a fifty-second penalty at the very beginning of the race for incorrectly passing the gate. Přindiš and Prskavec, on the other hand, can now rest and concentrate on Sunday&#39;s semi-finals.
&quot;I set myself the goal of making it into the top 30 on the first run, which I did. Not that I care how I did, because it&#39;s a very early start on Sunday, so I was hoping to be a little bit higher to have a better starting position,&quot; Přindiš said, praising the well-being in Seu. &quot;Before the patrol race, I felt the worst in the 14 days we&#39;ve been here. Then during the race, it was good, and today it&#39;s better again. It&#39;s beautiful here all the time, nice races, the spectators came, so that&#39;s good,&quot; he smiled.
Prskavec was also satisfied. &quot;In qualifying, you don&#39;t want to make an unnecessary mistake. I didn&#39;t do well in the first stages. Then I drove the center perfectly, without any problems, and I knew that I had enough time, so the second mistake came when I wanted to go straight down and I turned the wheel. Overall, I can&#39;t be unhappy. The form is, we&#39;ll see how it goes,&quot; said this year&#39;s overall World Cup winner.
Both representatives boasted that they will only start at the end of the semi-final block on Sunday. &quot;I&#39;m not an early bird, it&#39;s also cold here in the morning, and when you&#39;re here at eight, you need a jacket and a sweatshirt,&quot; Prindis said. &quot;All in all, the semi-finals last an hour and a half, which is a pretty good difference in terms of sleep,&quot; agreed Prskavec.
Of the trio of Czech singkanoists, only Fišerová succeeded, Eva Říhová finished two places behind the top twenty, Kateřina Havlíčková was 35th. the track I wanted to ride. I made two moves and I&#39;m just behind the winner in pure time. I have a good starting position for the semi-finals,&quot; praised Fišerová.
Coal will give way to gas and nuclear. Renewable resources will not cover the increased demand, says the head of European ExxonMobil
Renewable resources will not be enough for the Czech Republic to meet future energy demand. Due to the unfavorable climate, wind and solar power plants need to be supplemented with other alternatives, such as those using natural gas.
Philippe Ducom, president of the European branch of the American concern ExxonMobil, one of the largest global oil producers, claims this in an interview for HN. At the same time, he mentions that large storage facilities, in which unused energy from days when the sun and wind are plentiful, could be stored for later are still too expensive.
Ducom visited the ExxonMobil center in Prague, where 1,200 people work and whose task is to support the company&#39;s business activities and provide logistics and other services needed for the company&#39;s operation.
Declaration of the end of the right in the lower house, or what kind of &quot;right-wing&quot; coalition of ODS, TOP 09, STAN and KDU?
Recently, there have been reports in the media and commentaries about the upcoming coalition of the mentioned parties. Many are applauding that the &quot;right&quot; is finally getting together, but I rather wonder why these parties still call themselves right-wing.
Leaving aside the new Tricolor movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing party. And it doesn&#39;t matter how the given subjects label themselves or what label the mainstream media parrots. The ODS is hardly centrist in its average of the top politicians of this party, TOP 09 is clearly the party of the urban pseudo-liberal left (which is ashamed of its leftism and thus hypocritically describes itself as conservative or even right-wing). STAN is a party that basically merges with TOP 09 in its concept, ideology and voter targeting (the reason for its existence is simply not clear to me). And the KDU even labels itself as centrist for a long time - however, their political compass is much more to the left than they say.
Do you feel that I have taken everyone out of the same water? No, I am based on the real political steps of these parties. If I consider myself a classically liberal right-wing voter, the highest value for me is the freedom of the individual, the free market and minimal interference by the state in the lives of individuals and the economy. How do these parties fulfill this general right-wing assumption? How many laws cutting people&#39;s freedoms by the salami method, raising taxes, confirming new regulations and increasing surveillance, increasing attachment to the socialist EU or promoting environmental and gender madness have they supported in recent years? A lot, really a lot. Not their labels, but their actions identify them. These parties, despite all kinds of declarations or partial concessions, want to strengthen the role of the state in our lives. And that has nothing to do with right-wingness.
I would not be at all surprised by the coalition cooperation of TOP 09, STAN and KDU, they simply belong together on the political map and, with the exception of Christian or, on the contrary, homosexual and gender aspects, I do not see any obvious difference in them for the voters in terms of the influence of the state on their lives. However, the ODS has long been portrayed as &quot;the only right-wing party&quot; and by associating with these three entities, it already openly reveals its true political affiliation.
By the way, when I mentioned the stickers briefly. Have you noticed how often all these parties cheaply label critics of dirigisme and socialism coming from the European Union as pro-Russian agents? Can&#39;t they or just don&#39;t want to understand that there are many people who do not smell Eurosocialism and growing unfreedom as strongly as the authoritarian regime in Russia? Are they hiding their complete incompetence in argumentation and their unreasonable or blind adoration of European Union conditions?
In short, it is possible that in the Czech Republic other than centrist politics no longer have a chance of greater success. Maybe voters really want this kind of merger. Maybe they want center-left politics under the guise of &quot;right-wing&quot; because they are ashamed of their political beliefs (or can&#39;t even identify them). I don&#39;t know. But I am definitely not one of those voters.
The unexplained death of a little girl (†8) in the Příbram region: The culprit will not be punished
Unexplained cases are called &quot;monuments&quot; in criminal slang. But they are also investigated if new information comes to light years later. Especially when it comes to the death of a child. In 1980, criminalist Jiří Markovič was able to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague&#39;s Prokopské údolí, who were already 12 years old at the time. &quot;A case from 1955? That will be difficult, very difficult. To start with, it would require finding the file, it may no longer exist, talking to those who investigated it. There is always hope, but it would be really difficult,&quot; says Markovič.
During the previous regime, the public did not get much information about violent crimes, but according to Markovič, this certainly does not mean that they were laxly investigated. &quot;It always depended on specific people,&quot; thinks the criminalist. The problem may be that materials from the 1950s may be destroyed, even though unclosed cases should not be shredded.
Lucia Bílá&#39;s father was not a fan of her at all. You won&#39;t believe what she had to do for a living!
Who doesn&#39;t know that the national treasure Lucie Bílá (53) is a seamstress by profession and her real name is Hana Zaňáková probably doesn&#39;t live in the Czech Republic. But the singer herself has now revealed that she almost worked in a glass factory!
Lucie Bílá knew from a relatively early age that she wanted to be a singer. Her love for singing was born when, as a little girl, she performed in the cultural center in her native Otvovice, where the warbler still lives.
&quot;And I remember exactly where my mother was sitting. That&#39;s when a singer was born in me,&quot; she admitted to Impulsu radio.
However, her father was a little worried about his daughter&#39;s future and therefore advised her to take the path of a trade that has a golden bottom.
&quot;Dad always said, &#39;Craft girl, craft. Keep your feet on the ground!&#39; He even persuaded me if I wanted to go to the local glass factory. The glass factory no longer works, I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m a trained seamstress and at home I make various rosaries and pendants from beads, which I then auction at auctions and use the money to buy wheelchairs,&quot; she added with a laugh.
The launch of the new toll is not threatened, reports the Kremlin. But there is a change of operator in the game
On Friday, the Ministry of Transport started preparations for a new tender for the operation of the new toll system. It is a back-up plan that the state would use in the event that the current toll contract is legally cancelled. In addition, the state is also preparing another provisional solution in case the tender is not completed on time. Transport Minister Vladimír Kremlík (for ANO) stated this on Facebook.
On Thursday, the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS) banned the implementation of the toll contract between the state and the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium, with a one-year delay. The Ministry will file an appeal against this.
&quot;The launch of the new toll collection system is not at risk. Starting today, we are starting the preparation of a new transparent procurement procedure, the subject of which will be the services of operating the new toll system, which is now being completed by the CzechToll and SkyToll consortium,&quot; said the minister.
The state would thus be looking for the operator of the toll currently being prepared, which will be launched from this December, in the tender. It would therefore not be a competition for a completely new toll system, as was the case with the last tender, nor the use of the old system now operated by Kapsch.
However, according to the Kremlin, the ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not have time to prepare the new tender in time. &quot;Based on previous experience with the course of the toll tender, I am deeply convinced that the ÚOHS is wrong and that it is objectively impossible to prepare and implement such a complex procurement procedure and hand over the operation of the toll system to a new operator in the period of 12 months set by it,&quot; he said.
In addition to the new procurement procedure, the resort will also prepare a provisional solution that would solve the collection of tolls for a temporary period until the state finds a full-fledged solution.
Apparently, the state will not yet use the offer that the current toll administrator Kapsch presented to it in recent days. The Austrian company offered the state the operation of the existing system in case the toll contract was cancelled.
At the same time, the Kremlin reiterated that it believes that a backup plan will not be needed. The Ministry will therefore file an appeal against the decision of the Antimonopoly Office.
On Thursday, the ÚOHS issued a decision in which it prohibited the performance of the toll contract. However, the ban will only come into effect one year after the authority&#39;s decision becomes legal. This is not valid and an appeal against it can be filed with the chairman of the office. The Ministry and CzechToll are therefore continuing to prepare the new toll, which should be launched in December.
In last year&#39;s tender for the new toll system and its operator, the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium won. It succeeded in the toll tender with an offer of 10.75 billion crowns for ten years of operation. The current operator Kapsch protested against the course of the tender and the validity of the toll contract, which failed in the competition with an offer of over 13 billion crowns.
I still see myself as a boy who is just looking around, says Jan Cina
&quot;That was a great school for everyone who worked on it. I fell in love with Afro dance there. Since I have something Roma in me from my dad, it completely enchanted me,&quot; said Jan Cina, who considers himself mainly a musical actor.
He has much fresher memories than the series První krok in the role of a painter in the new film Národní třída. Cina revealed that director Štěpán Altrichter must have tempted him a lot. &quot;The work was demanding, but the result is worth it. The film was made a year ago. Hard and honest, but at the same time fun. It was filmed on Národní třída, where I drove a car as a non-driver. A lot of filming was also done in the Southern Town in Prague,&quot; he said to the Czech-German co-production film.
Even though he is nominated for a Thalia Award for his role in the production of The Little Prince, he does not consider it the highlight of his career. &quot;I don&#39;t feel that way. I still see myself as a boy who is just looking around for now. But the nomination is very pleasant and surprising. I can see the peak far ahead of me,&quot; he revealed, saying that he did not even think about the acceptance speech in case of victory. &quot;No, but as a kid, when I listened to talk shows on the radio, I always imagined myself talking to people.&quot;
Jan Cina has been living with his colleague Petr Vančura for thirteen years. What is his recipe for a happy relationship? &quot;To like each other and see problems as a challenge and a good thing to solve,&quot; he revealed, recalling the awarding of the Czech Lions when his friend fell on the stairs.
&quot;Yes, it really did. He had new slippery shoes and the red carpet was slippery too. So it wasn&#39;t long before he was on the ground. He was able to make it a priority. He had a workshop called Venture Stairs where he taught how to safely fall down stairs at VIP events. &quot;
The Děčín Zoo is happy to have a small macaque
&quot;Our troop currently has seven members. Her youngest member was born on August 17, the female Buffy gave birth to him and he is her fifth cub, the father is the male Hitam. The first days after birth, the female carried the cub tightly pressed to her body and did not want to show it to the world for a long time , whether she gave birth to a male or a female. At about three weeks of age, the cub began to gradually put it down for a little while, and the keepers already know for a few days that it is a male,&quot; said zoo spokeswoman Alena Houšková, adding that the Děčín Zoo had already successfully bred 12 young of this species.
Crested macaques are so-called endemics of the island of Sulawesi, that is, they do not live anywhere else in the world in the wild. A typical feature is the black coat and crest on the head, which gives them their name. Crested macaques live in rainforests, mainly at lower altitudes.
Like most primates, they feed on plant and animal food. The menu is dominated by the fruits of forest trees, which are complemented by flowers and leaves. They meet their protein needs by eating small arthropods, larvae and, to a lesser extent, bird eggs and chicks.
&quot;If we leave aside the natural enemies, which are pythons, everything else has been written down by man. Local residents hunt macaques as a favorite prey with tasty meat and for their fur. Burning and cutting down the rainforest is also fatal for these animals,&quot; added the spokeswoman .
Germany reports the first case of West Nile virus infection from a mosquito on its territory. It has to do with climate change
In addition to West Nile fever, mosquitoes can also transmit, for example, malaria.
Germany reported on Friday the first case of a person contracting West Nile fever on German soil after being bitten by an infected mosquito. This was reported by the DPA agency. Until now, all sick people contracted the virus during travel or contact with sick animals. According to experts, the breakthrough case of infection is related to climate change.
The Robert Koch Institute reported that a 70-year-old man from Saxony contracted the virus. His illness had a serious course and he was treated in a hospital in Leipzig for brain inflammation. He is now healthy.
West Nile virus was first identified in 1937 in Uganda. Meanwhile, it spread to large parts of Africa, Asia and Europe, and in the 1990s to the United States. Its carriers are mainly birds and also mosquitoes, which become infected with their infected blood.
Managers of state-owned companies have to go through a selection process. The law will be circumvented, the opposition claims
&quot;This is a typical bill that is unnecessary,&quot; said the chairman of the ODS parliamentary club Zbyněk Stanjura.
After several unsuccessful attempts, the Chamber of Deputies approved changes that are intended to prevent the non-transparent distribution of functions - critics speak of newsagents - in state-owned companies. Newly, applicants should go through a selection process at the given ministry and will also be assessed by the government committee for personnel nominations.
However, this is a compromise solution, which, for example, the ODS does not like, because it will allegedly allow ministers to make excuses that the selection commissions are to blame for any bad selection of state managers. Moreover, the opinion of the mentioned committee will not be binding for the minister. The news still needs to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Miloš Zeman.
Přerov: The driver crashed near the village of Kokory: He died wedged in his Fabia
The tragic traffic accident occurred on Friday on a straight section between Přerov and the village of Kokory. The 28-year-old driver of the Fabia lost control and drove off the road. The car flipped onto its roof and he was wedged underneath. He did not survive his injuries.
&quot;According to the initial information found on the spot, a passenger vehicle traveling in the direction of Kokory went off the road, where it overturned onto the roof and the driver was wedged under the vehicle,&quot; Přerov police spokeswoman Miluše Zajícová told novinky.cz.
And where are the viewers? Doha cannot be London
At the same time, however, it is a step back, because by going to Doha, athletics voluntarily and consciously renounced the captivating atmosphere that reigned in the sold-out stadium in London 2017 and last year at the European Championships in Berlin.
Giant banners on the walls of skyscrapers in Doha invite to &quot;the biggest sporting event of 2019&quot;. However, concerns about how dignified her backdrops will be are growing.
&quot;Tickets for the destination are sold out for all evenings,&quot; say the organizers.
But that is too little.
The upper walkway of the Khalífa Stadium, with a total capacity of 40,000 spectators, is already covered with colorful tarpaulins, on which the flags of the 209 participating countries are depicted. Athletics in Qatar has ventured into territory where, despite the annual meeting of the Diamond League, it does not have deep roots.
So let&#39;s not be surprised that last week only 50,000 tickets were sold for the ten days of the championship, although their price started at 60 Qatari riyals, i.e. converted to almost 400 crowns.
The organizers have now set themselves the goal that the uncovered parts of the stands are at least half full. Therefore, according to the sources of the British newspaper Giuardian, they allegedly (although the organizers themselves deny this) give free tickets to migrants who work here as laborers, as well as to children. Sebastian Coe, the head of the IAAF athletics association, can also comment positively: &quot;This is how we can inspire the next generation.&quot;
Wealthy Qatar has won world championships in handball and cycling in the past, after athletics it will be football&#39;s turn in 2022. Financial offers from an oil powerhouse will always be lucrative even for rich sports federations. Such is the reality of today&#39;s sports world.
But even if we approach it and ignore the absence of fans in the stadium, we cannot resist a purely sporting sigh that the experiment with the first outdoor World Athletics Championships in the Arabian Peninsula should have been timed better by the leaders of the IAAF - and for another year. The extremely late deadline, forced by the climate, disrupts the entire scheme of the season in the pre-Olympic year and thus also the preparation for the key Olympic season, which under normal circumstances would already start in October for athletes.
Hopefully, Qatar will at least make up for it with technological innovations, with the help of which they promise an ultra-modern and attractive championship. Is it 37 degrees right now? Already now, the area of the stadium is artificially air-conditioned to twenty-four. And the advanced cameras, built directly into the blocks, are supposed to show TV viewers in detail what is happening inside the athletes in the hundredths of a second before and just after the starter&#39;s shot.
Sparta is really busy this year, acknowledges the Hradec defender Nedomlel
In his case, the increased motivation is more than understandable. Hradec hockey defender Richard Nedomlel will play against the club where he recently worked in Friday&#39;s game. But the former Spartan is convinced that his teammates will be in a similar situation, even though they have never worn the shirt of the Prague club.
&quot;Everyone wants to pull out against Sparta,&quot; says the defender from Hradec Králové before the match of the 5th extra league round.
In it, Hradec Králové will try to extend its winning streak, which at the moment includes three three-point wins in a row. After Kladno and Pilsen came the most appreciated by the fans on Sunday, Mountfield traveled to neighboring Pardubice.
&quot;But we can&#39;t look at the matches that were. We need to focus on the matches that await us now and play in them as well, if not better,&quot; the Hradec defender points out.
Hradec Králové should not even look back at last year&#39;s balance with Sparta. They lost in three out of four matches, taking points only once after the victory in Prague after extra time. In addition, Sparta&#39;s management brought several significant reinforcements in the summer and expects the team to return to the top.
&quot;Sparta always had quality players, but what are we talking about, this year they are really loaded,&quot; admits Nedomlel before the first match later this week.
And the other one? Also a nice shift, waiting for Mountfield on Sunday afternoon in Třinec.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has hidden bitcoins and doesn&#39;t know what to do with them
Venezuela&#39;s central bank is conducting internal tests to see if it can hold cryptocurrencies. It is responding to an instruction from the state-owned company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which seeks to be able to send bitcoins and ethers to the central bank, and for the bank to then pay the oil company&#39;s suppliers in cryptocurrencies. Staff are also studying a proposal to allow the central bank to count cryptocurrencies in foreign reserves, which are now near a 30-year low. This was reported by Bloomberg, citing information from four sources.
Sanctions imposed by the United States against the authoritarian regime of President Nicolás Maduro have largely cut off Venezuela from the global financial system. This further deepened the country&#39;s economic crisis. However, the current crisis is one of the most serious in the world, which has forced officials to use a mixture of different ways to move money. While Maduro&#39;s bid to launch the world&#39;s first state-owned cryptocurrency failed, ongoing efforts to use digital currencies show how desperate the government is to find ways around the restrictions.
Neither Venezuela&#39;s central bank nor PDVSA responded to a request for comment.
It is not clear how PDVSA came to own bitcoins and ethers, or how much value of these currencies it owns. The business is struggling to get payments from customers through conventional channels because big banks are unwilling to do business with entities that are subject to sanctions. Last month, the firm received most of the $700 million (CZK 16.6 billion) payment in Chinese yuan as the parties failed to find financial institutions to facilitate the transaction.
PDVSA may be reluctant to sell cryptocurrencies on the open market, as that would require it to register on an exchange and undergo due diligence. Instead, he wants the cryptocurrency to be used by the central bank to pay entities that PDVSA owes. Representatives of the oil company believe that the central bank is less exposed to possible obstacles that could arise when paying with cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoins and ethers use a decentralized internet ledger known as blockchain to verify and record transactions. In some cases, relatively anonymous transfers are possible without the need for an intermediary. Few banks are involved in digital currencies because of the money laundering and customer information issues associated with them, complicating compliance.
After the debacle of 2018, cryptocurrencies are seeing a return to prominence this year thanks to expectations of greater institutional adoption and Facebook&#39;s plan to come up with its own cryptocurrency. Even so, they remain unstable. Bitcoin is down nearly 20 percent over the past four days, but has gained about 130 percent since the beginning of the year.
Neckermann cancels all flights, it affects five hundred Czech clients
Neckermann is canceling flights in connection with the insolvency of the British Thomas Cook and his German daughter.
&quot;The Czech company Thomas Cook, s.r.o., operating under the trade name Neckermann Cestovní kancelář, has not filed for insolvency,&quot; Šrámek said in a press release.
&quot;However, CK Neckermann is forced to continue canceling the planned departures of its clients,&quot; he added, adding that this currently applies to all departures from September 26 to October 6.
According to Šrámek, the cancellation of flights will affect approximately 500 clients. According to him, the 800 clients of Neckermann who are currently abroad &quot;will be taken care of and their safe return to the Czech Republic is ensured by their planned flight&quot;.
The travel agency admitted that some clients were asked to pay for their stay. &quot;In such a case, it is necessary for clients to immediately contact the SOS line of CK Neckermann,&quot; added Šrámek.
Thomas Cook&#39;s collapse happened on Monday. At the same time, in August of this year, the travel agency concluded an agreement, on the basis of which creditors were to invest 900 million pounds in the company.
Half of the amount was to be received from the Chinese company Fosun Tourism. Based on that, she should have become the majority owner. The other half was to be provided by bondholders and creditor banks. However, as early as September 20, there was information that the creditors demanded the travel agency to raise a reserve of 200 million pounds, otherwise the deal falls apart. On Monday, the company announced that it was bankrupt.
Someone killed a non-conflicting homeless woman under the bridge. Police are looking for witnesses
According to the Prague police, the murder took place sometime in the early evening or overnight from Tuesday to Wednesday. It is to this time that the police call for possible testimony relates.
&quot;One of the drivers who was driving over the bridge connecting Libeň and Žižkov or along the Pod Krejcárkem street could have filmed the killer, for example, on the dashboard camera. A witness might have just seen him and could describe him. In short, we welcome any testimony in this case and will accept him on line 158,&quot; said Jan Daněk, spokesman for the regional police headquarters.
According to spokesman Daňko, the murdered homeless woman was non-conflictual, did not drink alcohol and did not seek the company of other people. The woman lived at the crime scene. &quot;She was most often around Krejcárek, Palmovka and Holešovice, when she was carrying large blue shopping bags,&quot; added Daněk to the description of the victim, which could also help potential witnesses.
The Slovaks succeeded, they will only pay a fine for racist insults
The Slovak Football Association succeeded in its appeal against the closure of the stadium due to the racism of the fans. The national team was originally supposed to play the European Championship qualification match with Wales without spectators, instead the union will now only pay a fine of 15,000 euros (about 387,000 crowns).
The UEFA Disciplinary Committee has punished Slovakia and Hungary for the behavior of the fans during their recent qualifying match in Budapest, which the visiting team of Czech coach Pavel Hapal won 2-1. It closed the stadium for both associations for one match and fined Slovakia 20,000 euros and Hungary 67,000 euros.
After the appeal, the Slovaks were only fined 15,000 euros for insulting political shouts. The next match of the national team in the qualification for the European Championship against Wales on October 10 in Trnava will thus be made available to the fans.
The women&#39;s basketball players did not reach the medal from the under-17 World Cup, they finished fourth
The third U17 World Cup was also won by the American women, who beat Spain in the finals narrowly 77:75 despite the 40 points of the Spaniard Angela Salvadoresová.
&quot;We really wanted to win and not be potatoes, but maybe we wanted it too much. We grabbed the start, but we couldn&#39;t keep it because they rolled over us under the basket,&quot; lamented captain Karolína Malečková. &quot;Playing in front of such an audience was an incredible experience,&quot; she praised the fans in Klatovy and Pilsen.
The Czechs started very well, taking an 8-0 lead thanks to two three-pointers and dominating the court throughout the first quarter. At that moment, it seemed that they would avenge the defeat from the basic group 85:88 after overtime. But the referees whistled 15 fouls at halftime and helped Hungary get back into the game with a 12-2 lead with questionable decisions.
&quot;I&#39;m convinced that it was enough to make two or three more baskets, run to 20 points and we wouldn&#39;t have let it go. But instead, our mistakes came. I&#39;m not interested in the referees, but what we did wrong, and there were mistakes that helped the opponent catch up,&quot; coach Richard Fousek assessed.
&quot;It wasn&#39;t the first time we had a lapse in concentration. But the girls are fighters, they didn&#39;t let anything go and fought to the end. But the opponent was very good,&quot; he added.
The Czechs especially kept Petra Holešínská in the game with accurate shooting from a distance and the pivot Tereza Šípová. However, the best Czech scorer had a problem with fouls and missed a large part of the third quarter. The Hungarians took advantage of this and gained a slight lead, which they kept even though the Czechs fought until the last seconds.
&quot;For us, the first five matches were very demanding, we rotated the matches in a tight rotation and it cost us a lot of energy. You could already see against Spain that the girls were tired and there was nowhere to take them. Due to our physicality, we were not consistent in defense. We did not play a quick counterattack , we lacked a rebound. And the Hungarians are so good that if you don&#39;t put everything together, it&#39;s hard to win,&quot; added Fousek.
He believes that his ward has a promising future. &quot;In two years, the girls were able to win the Youth Olympics, be second at the 16-year-old European Championship, and now they are fourth in the world. By our standards, it is a quality team with good character, and we need to continue working with it and developing talent. Now it is up to the federation, which a coach will be assigned to them in the higher categories,&quot; added Fousek.
The end of political newspapers? According to critics, the new law will not help anyway!
But according to some opposition MPs, the law is more likely to allow ministers to get rid of responsibility for the election and at the same time continue to choose their own candidates.
Greater transparency in selection procedures for positions in state-owned companies - this is one of the goals of the Nomination Act. 119 MPs spoke in favor. The law was passed, for example, thanks to the votes of ANO, KSČM, Social Democrats and even the Pirates.
Candidates for state-owned companies will have to go through a selection process before a government committee. For example, it was the Pirates who sought to make the recommendation to the minister binding. That didn&#39;t work out in the end.
Civic democrats and the SPD movement fear that the nomination law will impose restrictions on ministers. &quot;Newly, the minister will be able to hide behind some decision of the commission and will therefore not have a clear, transparent responsibility,&quot; thinks SPD chairman Tomio Okamura. The vice-chairman of the ODS, Martin Kupka, speaks similarly.
The Government Committee should completely reject candidates who do not meet the conditions. These will include criminal integrity, being debt-free, a minimum age of 25, and the main selection criteria should also be expertise.
The law will still have to pass the Senate and then be signed by the president.
Tough competition for the Škoda Kamiq. Kia XCeed bets on rich equipment, at what price?
The Kia XCeed is a relatively difficult model to classify. It is clearly a compact SUV, but it does not offer all-wheel drive. He leaves this item to the larger Sportage sibling, which is a direct answer to cars such as Škoda Karoq, Opel Grandland X or Volkswagen Tiguan. Compared to them, the XCeed also bets on more dynamic body shapes, which, by sloping the rear part, can remotely resemble the world of SUV-coupes, popular in this part of the market, especially among the premium brands Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz.
On the other hand, the XCeed cannot be placed just alongside plasticized versions of classic compacts, which include, for example, the Ford Focus Active. Compared to it, the Koreans have made a much larger number of changes to the bodywork, so those who don&#39;t want to, may not even have to see the Ceed in new forms.
Unlike the compact hatchback or estate Ceed, the XCeed is also offered exclusively with turbocharged engines, so don&#39;t expect a basic naturally aspirated four-cylinder. The XCeed starts with a turbocharged liter and also offers a turbocharged 16-liter with 150 kW, the GT version reserved for its siblings. Don&#39;t expect a sporty grade here. The 1.6 CRDi turbodiesel is only offered in a mild-hybrid version, which means that the internal combustion engine is assisted by an electrical system that helps reduce consumption and emissions. From 100 kW, it is also possible to pay extra for a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic in addition to the manual.
The offer will soon be expanded to include a plug-in hybrid, i.e. a variant that can travel approximately six dozen kilometers on electricity alone. The batteries can also be charged from a normal socket.
Simona Krainová: Fuck the Age! Then she kissed Lucia Bíla!
The day before the launch of the Fuck The Age calendar, Simona Krainová published her latest photos, in which she is completely naked! &quot;I was a little afraid that people would judge me for taking pictures of myself naked at my age. I&#39;m quite a shy person. But so far I&#39;ve only had positive reactions. I wanted to show women that if you want, you can do it even at 46 years to have a solid figure. Of course, there is hard work and sacrifice behind it, but there is no other way.&quot;
&quot;We took about three thousand photos with Lukáš Dvořák, we chose about a hundred and there are twelve of them in the calendar, so the rest are still waiting for their moment. It&#39;s definitely not the last time I&#39;m naked,&quot; the model, who also came to her baptism, confided to Blesk very exposed.
She was wearing an elongated Bernhardt jacket and shorts underneath, but they were not visible, so it looked like she had forgotten her bottoms. Running every day has strengthened her legs, so she can afford similar models.
Simona was so happy with her success that she kissed everyone she met at the baptism. Husband, friends, even Slavica Lucia Bíla.
Autotuner brought the voice of the digital soul
Everything you know about obesity is wrong, reads the headline of a long text written for the Huffington Post by Michael Hobbes and photographed by Finlay Mackay. In a provocative explanation, it is written that the medical community ignored the facts about obesity for decades and waged a ruthless (and also unnecessary) war against overweight people, which not only affected public opinion, but also destroyed many lives. But now is the time for a new paradigm.
What Hobbes states at the outset is the fact that there is often a very long and tedious journey from knowing and knowing facts to putting them into practice. He mentions the case of scurvy, when some captains already in the seventeenth century distributed lemons, limes and oranges to their crew in the belief that they would prevent the disease. However, the British Navy abandoned this practice due to concerns about increased costs. The clear influence of the fruit in the prevention and treatment of the disease was then proven in the middle of the 18th century, but it took another fifty years before the navy took it into account. Even seat belts existed long before the invention of the car, but they only became mandatory in the 1960s, and the first confirmed death related to asbestos dates back to 1906, yet its first ban came in 1973.
&quot;Every discovery in the field of public health—and no matter how important it was—always had to compete with traditions, prejudices, and financial incentives within the society into which it was to be implemented,&quot; Hobbes writes. In American society today, almost 80 percent of the adult population and about one third of children meet the definition of overweight or obese. More Americans are living with obesity today than breast cancer, Alzheimer&#39;s, Parkinson&#39;s and HIV combined.
At the same time, obesity is seen as a supremely personal failure of the individual, which is claimed to burden the healthcare system and reduce GDP. The fear of being fat is so great in the population that Americans today spend more money on diets than they spend on computer games and movies. However, the truth is that diets don&#39;t work. Already in 1959, research showed that 95 to 98% of attempts to lose weight end in failure, and two-thirds of dieters subsequently gain more weight than they lost.
Armed with statistics, Hobbes goes on to describe the lifestyles and traumas of overweight people. Here the personal meets the systemic, when, for example, at the faculties, when teaching future doctors, only 19 hours of the entire course are devoted to the issue of nutrition. Which at a time when 60 percent of the calories Americans consume comes from ultra-processed food.
How obesity is stigmatized is illustrated by reports from surgeries where overweight people typically experience shorter visits, are treated with less empathy by doctors, and are seen as more problematic patients.
However, obesity is far from just an American problem, as Hobbes writes. Since 1980, the proportion of obesity has doubled in 73 countries of the world and increased in 113. And during that time, no country has managed to reduce and stop this increase. Absolutely none.
Brno Grand Prix? Ticket prices are at risk
The most expensive item is the registration fee every year before the Grand Prix. This year it was about one hundred and fifteen million crowns. &quot;The mass of people who come to Brno during the Grand Prix will spend money there on accommodation, food and entertainment, which should more or less balance the costs associated with organizing the event, including the registration fee,&quot; assessed economist Petr Pelc.
According to him, the importance of the race is also in attracting tourists to the city. &quot;Brno doesn&#39;t have that many international tourist attractions. The grand prix attracts visitors from abroad as well. It is just as important for Brno as, for example, the Turan airport or the exhibition center. And these are projects that are supported by public money,&quot; added the economist.
Grand Prix in Brno
- costs for the past five years: 686 million crowns
- profits from the past five years: 682 million crowns
- problem: lack of money for organizing, increasing registration fee for promoter company Dorna
- possible solutions: more money from the state, use of advertising space, increase in ticket prices
- current status: negotiations on a new contract for the organization of races for the next five years
According to the director of the Institute of Public Administration, Filip Hrůza, the organizers must now evaluate whether the race is beneficial for Brno. &quot;The Grand Prix siphons money from public budgets for other matters. But to a certain extent it is a political, and not an economic, issue,&quot; he thinks.
In the future, however, the costs of a motoring event may be even higher. There is an option to increase the registration fee almost twice.
&quot;The situation is not closed, we have to try to negotiate the best possible terms with Dorna. It also depends on the extent to which the state is ready to contribute to the organization of the race. If the worst scenarios were to come true, I am afraid that it is not realistic that the city and the region paid the extra amount,&quot; admitted Brno mayor Markéta Vaňková.
As Deník Rovnost has already reported, representatives of the South Moravian Region and Brno are also discussing the possibility of using advertising due to difficulties in raising money for the Grand Prize. &quot;Dorna&#39;s condition is that the advertisement must be placed in places that are not occupied by cameras. The choice of companies is also limited, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, the second sponsor cannot be a company from the same area,&quot; Vaňková explained.
Organizers can also get more money from tickets in future years. &quot;We have to sit down and say what the costs will actually be. And we have to adapt the revaluation of tickets to that,&quot; said Brno opposition representative for the ANO movement and former mayor Petr Vokřál.
Accident on D5: The highway was closed by a truck collision
The incident was reported around 08:00 at the 22nd kilometer in the direction of Prague. &quot;The highway is closed, at least for freight traffic. Passenger cars can drive through the gas station,&quot; police spokeswoman Michaela Richterová said in the morning. Traffic was restored around 2:30 p.m. According to Richter, the preliminary damage is at least two million crowns, the police are investigating the cause of the accident.
Petr Svoboda, spokesman for the Central Bohemian Fire Department, said that one truck was transporting passenger vehicles and the other was transporting plastic granules. &quot;Due to the large impact, there was a displacement of the transported vehicles, which the firefighters first had to secure against a possible fall,&quot; he added.
One of the cars had a damaged fuel tank from which about 200 liters of diesel leaked. Firefighters managed to pump out another 200 liters. Workers from the environment department of the Berun City Hall were called to the accident due to a fuel leak. The recovery of the crashed vehicles and the opening of the highway was ensured by a private company, which also excavated the contaminated soil.
Failed qualification. Czech athletes are not doing well in Doha so far
The World Championships in Doha began with qualifying failures for Czech athletics. Diana Mezuliáníková dropped out in the 800-meter run, and pole vaulter Romana Maláčová and hammer thrower Kateřina Šafránková failed to qualify, defending the eighth place she surprised the year before in London.
The start on Friday will also be completed by hurdler Vít Müller, and the night marathon race will be run by Marcela Joglová.
Šafránková threw 65.46 meters on her third attempt and was almost six meters short of her best this year, which she would have to improve in order to advance. Maláčová jumped 435 cm, 450 cm was already beyond her strength. To participate in the final, the limit of 460 cm had to be overcome.
Mezuliáníková, who got to the championship only at the last minute thanks to an invitation from the international federation IAAF, finished in the fourth run in the penultimate sixth place, and even her time of 2:03.48 minutes was not enough for her to advance to the semi-finals. She fell short of her best this year by one and a half seconds. &quot;It was quite fast for me, unfortunately I was fighting with my opponent in the corner, which took quite a bit of my strength. I thought I still had the strength, but it slowed me down there. I almost stopped and had to start again, so in this one was a little uncomfortable. I can&#39;t be completely satisfied,&quot; said the Czech representative.
She was happy that she overtook at least one rival in the finish line. &quot;She really wasn&#39;t doing well, so every defeated opponent was good. But I think it was for the fifth place. Unfortunately,&quot; she added. Winnie Nanyonda of Uganda was the fastest half-distance runner in the heats in 2:00.36.
In Doha, the best octogenarian of recent years, Caster Semenya from South Africa, is missing, who has too high a level of testosterone in her body, but, like some other runners, she refuses the treatment that the IAAF rules mandate from this year.
In the 100-meter races, the American Christian Coleman confirmed his role as the number one favorite, who was the only one to break the ten-second mark with a time of 9.98. His compatriot Justin Gatlin, who is trying to defend his title at the age of 37, also advanced to the semi-finals. The Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who with a performance of 9.86 is second in this year&#39;s tables, did not start, and his fight with Coleman, who has a performance of 9.81 this season, was expected.
Cuban Juan Miguel Echevarría already showed great form in the long distance qualification, who reached a distance of 840 cm with his first jump. No athlete has jumped that far in World Championship qualification in the last 20 years. The 21-year-old Cuban leads this year&#39;s charts with a performance of 865 cm.
The French Oscar nominee Les Miserables will open the Be2Can show
The Golden Bear and both winners of the acting awards from this year&#39;s Berlinale, the director&#39;s award and the jury award from Cannes and much more will present the 6th year of the festival film from Berlin, Venice and Cannes. This year too, the Be2Can festival will bring a selection of the most remarkable and thought-provoking that the competitions of the three most important European film festivals have presented.
The opening film of this year&#39;s show will be the French drama Les Miserables, for which the author of the film Ladj Ly won the Jury Prize at this year&#39;s Cannes festival. The film is a French Oscar candidate. The preview of the film in Prague will be personally presented by the representatives of the two main roles of police officers of the criminal unit, actors Alexis Manenti and Djibril Zonga. Alexis Manenti also co-wrote the film.
This year, Be2Can will take place in Prague&#39;s Lucerna and Edison Filmhub cinemas, as well as in Brno (Art cinema), Ostrava (Minikino) and Zlín (Golden Apple Cinema) from October 2 to 8.
Ladj Ly&#39;s feature-length directorial debut was shown and awarded at a number of other world festivals after its success in Cannes. It won the Best Film Award and the Best Screenplay Award at the Durban IFF, and was also screened at the Zurich, Shanghai, Munich, Melbourne, Sarajevo and San Sebastián IFFs.
As part of the festival, viewers can also look forward to the films Synonyma, Young Ahmed, Disruptor of the System, Goodbye, My Son, Sorry, We Didn&#39;t Catch You, Ghost Town Anthology and The Golden Glove. But they can also look forward to other fresh news from this year&#39;s Venice, which will be headed for Czech distribution: sci-fi Ad Astra, Joker, and the Czech triumph of The Painted Bird.
Which cities will disappear under the sea?
The vote of the upper house of the Canadian Parliament has confirmed a rumor that has been known for several days: Canada is withdrawing the honorary citizenship of the former legend of the fight for human rights, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Do Aung San Suu Kyi. The current leader of Myanmar (Burma), who spent years under house arrest for trying to bring freedom to her country, lost her honorary title for her role in the genocide against the minority Rohingya people.
The decision to grant Suu Kyi honorary citizenship was approved by the lower legislative body a week ago, and the senators have now unanimously supported it. &quot;It is the right message both for her and for Myanmar and for the whole world,&quot; commented independent senator Ratna Omidvar on the decision of her colleagues. &quot;We need to make it clear that the accomplices of genocide are not welcome here in Canada - all the more so as upstanding citizens.&quot;
The verdict of the Canadian parliament technically does not change anything for Suu Kyi, it is only an honorary title, but on a symbolic level it is a strong message for her. The long-time human rights campaigner&#39;s silence on the atrocities that the army of Buddhist-majority Myanmar has been perpetrating for endless months on the Muslim Rohingya minority is intolerable.
The fact that an officially organized genocide is taking place in Myanmar and that Suu Kyi - the de facto prime minister of the government there - has completely failed in her duty to protect her citizens, was brought out recently by a UN report. Specifically, it mentions the names of several army commanders who, according to the investigative team, should stand trial for crimes against humanity committed in actions that - as the report says - &quot;shock both the horror of their actions and the enormous scale&quot;. According to the UN, Suu Kyi and her administration were complicit mainly by covering up the actions of the soldiers and spreading a protective fog of lies around them - for example, that it was an &quot;anti-terrorist operation&quot;.
After Suu Kyi&#39;s removal, five figures remain on Canada&#39;s list of honorary citizens: Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tändzin Gjamccho, the 14th Dalai Lama, Karim Aga Khan IV, the 49th Imam of Shiite Muslims and Malala Yousafzai.
Developments around the former icon of the fight for freedom and democracy were also reflected by the Canadian Museum of Human Rights, where information about atrocities against the Rohingya and the parliamentary decision to strip her of the title of honorary citizen was added to Suu Kyi&#39;s profile. &quot;We have also dimmed the lighting of her photo on the human rights timeline board and are thinking about replacing her face with a portrait of a member of the Rohingya minority,&quot; Canadian media quoted museum spokesperson Rorie McLeod as saying.
The only thing that will remain with Suu Kyi in the current upheavals - at least for now - is the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to her at the suggestion of Václav Havel in 1991 for her enormous contribution to the fight for democracy. &quot;While Ms. Suu Kyi&#39;s current actions are deplorable, her award will not be revoked,&quot; Nobel Foundation head Lars Heikensten told Canada&#39;s CBS.
Microplastics found their way into human intestines, a study confirmed for the first time
The scientists&#39; suspicions of several years have been confirmed. A team led by Professor Philipp Schwabl of the University of Vienna has published a study that proves the presence of microplastics in human feces for the first time. Although the study is small, with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia, small plastic particles between 50 and 500 micrometers in size were found in the samples of all the people examined. None of the eight subjects were vegetarians, six of them did not avoid marine fish, all drank water from plastic bottles and food wrapped in plastic.
And it would actually be a bit of a miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics - which are either produced directly, for example for the needs of the cosmetics industry, or are created by the breakdown of larger pieces - are present in marine animals, insects, tap water and sodas; in short, everywhere on the planet. Thus, their entry into the human digestive system has only been officially confirmed. There were roughly 20 microplastic particles per ten grams of stool, and scientists estimate that more than half of the world&#39;s population will have them.
Of course, lay and scientific awareness knows that this is not good. However, humanity still does not know how bad it is - and what effect microplastics have on &quot;host&quot; organisms. Small particles can reach the bloodstream or the lymphatic system and end up, for example, in the liver. &quot;This is the first ever study of its kind, and it confirms what we&#39;ve thought for a long time. Now that we have the first evidence of microplastics in the human body, we need to continue to investigate exactly what this means for human health,&quot; says Schwabl.
So far, it is known that microplastics in the intestines can negatively affect the immune responses of the digestive system, thereby facilitating the absorption of toxic chemicals and other pathogens into the body. And so far, there is no known solution other than to limit the use of plastics, especially polypropylene. However, this will be difficult - the first task facing governments and authorities will at least be to stop its steep increase. As far as plastic bottles are concerned, experts estimate that in three years humanity will consume a fifth more of them than today. The current pace is a staggering million bottles bought per minute. About eight million tons of plastic end up in the seas and oceans every year. Litter threatens marine ecosystems and contaminates the digestive systems of marine animals.
Some countries have already taken steps towards restrictions and other measures, Kenya for example - under the threat of draconian punishments - has banned plastic bags. The European Commission is considering minor bans (a well-known straw), and the domestic Ministry of the Environment is heading in the same direction. Critics, however, claim that such measures are nice, but completely insufficient.
Harry in the footsteps of Princess Diana (†36)! where is meghan
Diana was exceptional in that she could capture people&#39;s hearts. In January 1997, she caused a stir when she visited Africa and, in particular, the minefields. Images of him wearing a protective suit and a face shield have become iconic. Even then, no one could have guessed that a few months later the princess of human hearts would take her last breath in a tragic car accident in Paris.
Now her younger son Harry also scored when he went to the same place as her after 22 years. He went to a demining site in Dirico, Angola, also donning a special protective suit and looking very pensive as he did so. He certainly couldn&#39;t resist the memories of his beloved mother, whom he lost when he was only 13 years old.
Harry gave a speech on the spot where he praised the efforts of the Halo Trust, which works to defuse minefields and other explosives in war-torn countries. &quot;Minefields are the unhealed wounds of war. By clearing them, we can help the community to find peace, which also brings opportunities,&quot; he said, appealing also to save and maintain wildlife and the local river as a source of water. After this visit, the Duke of Sussex moved to Huamba to rename the local orthopedic center after his famous mother, Princess Diana.
He did not forget to mention her on the official Instagram account: &quot;The Duke is honored to be able to visit the place and community that were so important to his mother, learn about their tireless mission and speak for all of whom (Diana) felt that the most they needed to be heard, even if the issue wasn&#39;t popular worldwide,&quot; Sussex Royal said in a post on Instagram.
But royal fans may be disappointed that he did not take his wife Meghan (38) and their son Archie (4 months) on such a trip to remember Diana. Both of them have a separate program from Harry since Wednesday, apparently for their protection. After all, taking a small baby into a minefield doesn&#39;t sound very safe, and Harry doesn&#39;t want to put his beloved family in danger at any cost.
Only children. We are not sure of reproduction, but we don&#39;t have to worry
Some words have bad connotations, even if they only convey the state of affairs. The word only child belongs to them. It refers to a child growing up without siblings, but it does not sound neutral. &quot;You know that, an only child,&quot; he says without needing to add anything. It is interesting that &quot;only child&quot; carries this feature since long ago, even from the times when expressions like demographic crisis were not widely used.
Today, even people outside the scientific community know that a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is necessary to ensure the simple reproduction of the population. It is also widely known that no state in Europe today achieves this value. France and Sweden are the closest to it, but the simple rate of population reproduction is not ensured by European states. (Within the West, only Israel stands out, with a total fertility rate of 3.1 children per woman.) It is a situation made for alarmism. That is why it is not surprising that the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, Maláčová, also falls for him: &quot;There are almost as many single children as families with two children,&quot; she said in an interview for LN. But she forgot the devil hidden in the detail.
Yes, it is good when the problem is pointed out instead of trivialized or ideologized. Like in Germany, for example, where the campaign for more children easily gets the label of fad (in the style of &quot;even Hitler supported it&quot;). It is good to be reminded that many couples directly plan for an only child. It is good if politicians show the will to remove the obstacles that lead to those decisions (for example, the weak expansion of work from home discourages women from further pregnancies). But despite all that, let&#39;s point out one thing.
When Minister Maláčová says that &quot;there are almost so many only children&quot; there is a sprinkle of demagoguery in it. That statement was appropriate twenty years ago. Let us remind you that fertility in the Czech Republic last ensured simple reproduction in 1980 (&quot;Husákovy děti&quot;). Then it dropped to a terrifying 1.14 in 2000. But since then it has risen by almost fifty percent, to the current 1.70 children per woman, which is above the European average. It is still not enough for simple reproduction, so the activity of politicians is appropriate. Only with the alarmism can they take a little away.
Costa Rica is a champion in the fight against climate change
Costa Rica received the title for several reasons. For a start, for the plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 - however, many countries have committed to this as part of the Paris Agreement. The Central American country, with a population of around five million, produces only 0.4 percent of global emissions. Costa Rica has also pledged to go fully renewable by 2030, with 70 percent of buses or taxis expected to run on electricity.
The official tourism organization states that already about 95 percent of energy comes from renewable sources - in 2017, Costa Rica ran on them for a total of 300 days.
Costa Rica is proud of almost thirty national parks.
The density of afforestation also contributes to the reduction of emissions. Rain forests with diverse fauna and flora, which cover more than half of the country&#39;s territory, are also one of the main tourist attractions. &quot;Costa Rica is a pioneer in the field of nature conservation and sets an example for other countries in the region and around the world. Climate change requires urgent action from all of us,&quot; the UN said in a statement.
Costa Rica can be proud of almost thirty national parks, which is really a lot considering the small size of the country (51,100 square kilometers). Rain or cloud forests, coral reefs or mangrove swamps are home to five percent of the world&#39;s biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, picturesque waterfalls and you would also find several rescue stations for sloths.
Kind to the planet. The Night of Scientists begins in Prague
&quot;In Prague, I would definitely visit CTU and look at a model of what smart cities will look like. At Charles University, I would visit the Department of Anatomy at the Faculty of Medicine, which is otherwise not open to the public,&quot; advises Jitřenka Navrátilová, national coordinator of the Night of Scientists.
The Department of Anatomy offers a tour of the dissection room and the opportunity to try working with surgical instruments.
&quot;Then I would go over to the ČZU and watch the movie Green Desert,&quot; adds Navrátilová. Nine laboratories will also offer guided tours. The motto of this year&#39;s Night of Scientists is &quot;kind to the planet&quot;.
The Supreme Prosecutor renewed the prosecution of the mother who manipulated the daughter against the father
Supreme Prosecutor Pavel Zeman does not agree with the acquittal of the mother, who manipulated her daughter for a long time and disrupted her relationship with her father. She faced charges of abuse and endangering education. The regional court acquitted her of the charges, Zeman disagrees. According to his appeal to the Supreme Court, a similar act can be seen as a criminal act.
The Supreme Court&#39;s decision could have a wider impact on other cases. &quot;A more specific definition of such a specific form of abuse can be considered necessary also from the point of view of streamlining further application practice,&quot; Zeman&#39;s appeal states.
The district court in Svitavy first found the woman guilty last year of abusing a trusted person and endangering the upbringing of a child. She formed a strong, almost symbiotic bond with her daughter, even in a situation where she should have been entrusted to her father.
The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a significantly negative relationship with the father. The situation marked the emotional development of the daughter, who was even hospitalized. She threatened to harm herself in the event of her father&#39;s custody.
The Svitava court sentenced the mother to two years in prison with a two-year suspended sentence. However, the Pardubice branch of the regional court acquitted the woman of the charges in the appeal process, saying that it is not a criminal offense. The same verdict was repeated by the regional court even after the Supreme Court ordered it to decide again.
The regional court noted that situations where one parent manipulates a child towards the other are not at all exceptional. It is resolved in guardianship proceedings, possibly with the help of psychologists or youth social protection authorities. Only in exceptional cases is criminal law the solution.
However, according to the chief prosecutor, the woman committed both torture and endangering her upbringing. &quot;The accused acted in a completely targeted manner when she aroused negative feelings in her daughter towards her father, and purposefully confirmed these negative emotions. With such actions, she not only followed the illicit intention of limiting or excluding the father&#39;s contact with the minor, but she must have been aware that this in the psychosocial will cause negative consequences in the sphere of minors,&quot; the appeal states.
Zeman asked the Supreme Court to return the case to the regional court once more. It appears from the appeal that the child is now in the care of the father.
Step down, Czernin called on Schiller for her words about opposition dirt
&quot;I consider it completely unacceptable that a member of the Czech government anywhere, much less on the floor of the parliament, uses such a totalitarian statement,&quot; Czernin wrote in an open letter to Schiller.
Her words caused a stir during the discussion of the draft constitutional lawsuit against President Miloš Zeman. The opposition did not get enough votes, and the draft constitutional lawsuit brought by the Senate was thrown off the table by the deputies.
&quot;I&#39;m getting dozens of messages from people I don&#39;t know. There&#39;s not a single voice in support of this lawsuit. There&#39;s messages in support of the president and messages like how taxpayers&#39; money is being spent here, how empty straw is being thrashed. And even if I dare, I&#39;m not using harsh expressions, to quote one of them: It&#39;s opposition and senatorial dirt,&quot; said the finance minister.
&quot;These expressions were used by the Nazis to refer to citizens of Jewish origin and the communists to their political opponents. It is totalitarian rhetoric, without an iota of respect for people and opinions,&quot; wrote the minister, TOP 09 vice-chairman Czernin, who will compete for the post of party chairman in the fall with the former first vice-chairman, Markéta Pekarová Adamova.
&quot;I was quoting one of the many reports that I received dozens of during the session of the Chamber of Deputies. Their common denominator was disgust at the constant personal dishonor that we witness daily in domestic politics and which was also the main motive of Thursday&#39;s session of the Chamber. The fact that someone applies to itself, it surprises me,&quot; Schillerová responded to ČTK.
Destroyed shops, fires in the streets, commemorative procession were accompanied by riots
Five years ago, 43 students of the university in Ayotzinapa disappeared, despite an extensive investigation, the case has not yet been clarified. The students were reportedly detained by police in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It is not clear exactly what happened next, but according to the investigation, the students apparently ended up in the hands of a local syndicate and were subsequently killed and burned, APTN reports.
A memorial procession was held in Mexico&#39;s capital on Thursday, as families wanted to express their frustration at the continued failure to find answers and explain the disappearance of their children.
However, the mostly peaceful march was disrupted by smaller groups of vandals who destroyed everything in their path. Vandals destroyed shops and hotels, they didn&#39;t even bother to destroy monuments, they started fires and smashed windows in the city.
Even before the march, President Andres Manuel López Obrador said he would do everything to catch him and asked the public for any information that would lead to clarification of the case.
Over 142 people were detained as part of the investigation, but not a single one of them was convicted. Many of them had to be released because their human rights were violated, and investigators allegedly tortured the suspects, APTN adds.
Mahulena Bočanová interrupted her annual detox and is sinning again!
More than a year ago, Mahulena Bočanová confided in Blesk that she had been drinking alcohol. &quot;During the holidays, I told myself that I would give my old worn-out 50-year-old body a breather. I gave myself a deadline forever. I feel very rested, I have a lot of energy, and most of all, my psyche has improved. I haven&#39;t been feeling well mentally lately. I feel better I wake up, I don&#39;t have a headache, I have more energy, money.&quot;
A year of abstinence was said to be enough and the actress found her way to alcohol again. &quot;Sometimes I drink bubbles or quality wine, but I don&#39;t drink what I used to. I drink one glass and have fun until the morning. I have a bottle of wine in the fridge for about a week. I also got a taste for non-alcoholic beer, which I can drink at any time,&quot; she boasted Mahulena, who is still a couple with Brno businessman Petr.
Bočanová has also returned to the theater season after the holidays and will be appearing in the series Ordinace v rozá žádraten. &quot;I&#39;m ashamed of the first two performances, I was really bad, I argued. But it&#39;s getting better,&quot; smiles the actress critically.
Jaromír Soukup spoke about Gott: He mainly wishes for peace
Moderator and entrepreneur Jaromír Soukup (50) is not afraid of any questions. In his show, Call and write to the boss, he speaks publicly on various topics. And he is no stranger to tabloid cases, which he brilliantly and humorously glosses over. Although this time he was not amused.
Jaromír Soukup commented on the sad news, which is the very serious illness of Karel Gott. He promised the singer one very considerate thing for himself.
&quot;You know, Karel got sick and he said it fairly, without having to be poked around by tabloid journalists somewhere. I don&#39;t want to comment on it, it&#39;s a serious illness, we all respect Karel Gott immensely. And of course, I would like to wish him successful treatment and, above all, peace! The calm that he needs now,&quot; stated the owner of the television Barrandov.
&quot;I wish the media would leave him alone. And wait for the news that the Master himself decides to give to the media. I don&#39;t even like the various statements, what his old acquaintances and various celebrities think about his health. And for I can tell our media that we will focus on his illness and his person only if he himself shows interest in it. In my opinion, other media should consider a similar approach.&quot;
Young Czechs think they can do it with money. The survey did not confirm this
&quot;So it turns out that young Czechs have somewhat more confidence in their knowledge of finances than the reality. In this case, women and respondents without a high school diploma had a significantly larger share of wrong answers,&quot; said the director of KRUK, Jaroslava Palendalová.
Men and young high school or university students are more likely to believe in their knowledge of financial products.
Young Czechs learn most about the functioning of financial matters from their parents (37 percent), self-study on the Internet (23 percent) and, in third place, from lessons at school (21 percent).
It is mainly women who consult their parents about questions about finances, while men are more likely to look for information on the Internet. Getting financial information from parents prevails among young people of all ages, regardless of their educational attainment or personal income. Prospectuses of financial institutions, professional magazines and publications have practically minimal influence.
&quot;Once again, the importance of the upbringing of children by their parents, who represent authority in all major areas of life, is shown. That is why the level of financial literacy of parents, who transfer their knowledge and experience to their offspring, is key,&quot; said Palendalová.
94 percent of young people prefer savings and investments.
Young people are clearly concerned with the question of whether it is better to save and buy, for example, your own house or apartment, or to enjoy yourself and rather spend money, without saving and owning your own home.
The strategy of savings and investment in long-term tangible assets is recognized by 94 percent of those interviewed. This applies across all age categories of young people, regardless of educational attainment, social status or current level of personal income.
The survey strategy is 100% supported by married people with two or more children and employees in the public sector. On the contrary, people living alone and with an income of over 30,000 crowns a month want to enjoy themselves.
The hunter was injured when he fell from his perch, and was carried to the ambulance for three hours
The unfortunate accident happened before 8:30 in the evening in the top parts near Čertova mlýn.
&quot;It was a very difficult and inaccessible terrain, so we dispatched five of our rescuers with the appropriate equipment to the injured man. At the same time, we asked for the cooperation of the Medical Rescue Service of the Moravian-Silesian Region. The paramedics then dispatched an ambulance to the accident,&quot; described the circumstances of the intervention, Libor Kluz, Horská dispatcher Beskydy services.
The rescuers found the hunter in the chosen location with multiple injuries. They immediately treated him and then gently, but with difficulty, transported him on a so-called Austrian cart over impassable terrain.
&quot;The transport along the route of about one and a half kilometers was slow and difficult. The injured Nimrod was therefore handed over to the ambulance crew after approximately three hours,&quot; added Libor Kluz.
According to Radan Jaskovský, the authorized chief of the Beskydy Mountain Service and at the same time the rescuer who intervened, fortunately a fellow hunter was able to describe in detail where the injured man was.
&quot;That&#39;s why we found him relatively quickly. However, if he had the Rescue app on his phone, our rescuers would certainly have been to him earlier, and at the same time, the dispatcher of line 155 would have known about the accident and his situation immediately,&quot; commented Radan Jaškovský.
He added that a charged mobile phone with the Záchranka application activated should be a matter of course in the mountains today.
Zeman as a conservationist - A man straining the constitution calls for the enforcement of the law
Anyone who moves in a society divided into camps and doesn&#39;t want to go completely crazy will welcome a situation where they don&#39;t have to support only their own. When can he admit positives even to those whom he otherwise criticizes. If only so that he does not feel that he is oriented only according to the pre-allocated stickers. Such situations also include the list of severely damaged monuments, which President Zeman fences with during his favorite trips to the regions.
Everyone knows what it&#39;s about. And those who occasionally travel through the Czech Republic see many of the devastated monuments - from the centers of historic towns to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches and estates - with their own eyes. Everyone knows that even here the word demagoguery can come into play. That if we criticize the city hall for not taking care of monuments or some horror in the spatial plan, it may be the work of former administrations. Or a privatized object whose owner cannot be traced. The head of state calls for local politics: &quot;A paragraph of the monument law allows you to fine owners of buildings who do not take care of their property.&quot; But even if the owner is elusive, it must be admitted that the president is calling for law enforcement. Which even critics of his bending of the constitution should recognize as a plus.
Of course, Miloš Zeman would not be Miloš Zeman if he considered all the details and formalities of a complex problem. But he stands for a good cause, similar to squatters, which he himself does not recognize. Two years ago, we wrote: &quot;Despite all the swearing, squatters draw attention to a problem outside of current interest. That this or that building is in a state of disrepair.&quot; And let&#39;s face it, the president does de facto the same thing.
If you come to the historic center of Jáchymov, you will be amazed at how devastated it is - including houses with Renaissance cores. At a time when Jáchymov is celebrating 500 years of silver mining and the minting of tolars (dollars for Americans). Why? Supposedly because of the boom in home sales in the 1990s, officials there say. But why is it that seven kilometers away, Ostrov, the seat of the Šlik family, who minted the Jáchymovsk tolars, has its historical core nicely repaired? It is good if the president draws attention to these things.
At the memorial to the victims of terror, Babiš called for security cooperation
On September 27, 2019, Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monika visited the Ground Zero memorial to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in New York.
Terrorism is the main enemy against which all countries of the world should fight together. At the end of a five-day visit to the United States, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš announced this today at the New York memorial to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. On this occasion, the Prime Minister honored the memory of two victims of Czech origin.
&quot;It&#39;s a very touching place,&quot; said the Prime Minister when, accompanied by his wife Monika, he laid a white rose next to the names of Lukáš Rambousk and Czechoslovak emigrant Alena Sešínová. Both were among the more than 2,750 killed in the attack by hijacked planes on the former twin towers of the World Trade Center (WTC). The WTC towers collapsed after the impact, in their place there is now a memorial with a list of names of the victims.
&quot;We need to remember what happened here, the horror,&quot; said Babiš. The Prime Minister identified the attack on the USA on September 11, 2001 as a reason why the UN should cooperate in a united campaign against international terrorism. At that time, in addition to the destruction of the WTC skyscrapers, the terrorists crashed a hijacked plane into the Ministry of Defense building in Washington, and they also planned another attack on a target in Washington, apparently the White House or Congress. But this plane crashed when the passengers resisted the hijackers.
&quot;That is our main enemy, that is where all the countries of the world should unite and fight international terrorism in a coordinated manner,&quot; added the Czech Prime Minister.
The Slovenians also defeated the Polish world champions and are in the finals of the EC
Slovenian volleyball players will sensationally play for the premier title of European champions. With the support of almost 12,000 boisterous fans in Ljubljana, they defeated the reigning two-time world champions Poles 3:1 and are the first finalists.
Who they challenge in Sunday&#39;s climax in Paris will be decided on Friday between France and Serbia.
The Slovenian team was much more compact than the Polish world champions in the semi-finals. They only had the beginning of the opening set and, with luck, the end of the second set, but the home volleyball players excelled in defense and of the players in the red and white jersey, only León, a native of Cuba, scored points.
On the other hand, in the home line-up, both smashers Čebulj and Urnaut, as well as the second all-rounder Štern, who soon replaced the lackluster Gasparini, were in top form. The Poles paid for the fact that they had won all their previous games at this Euro, while the Slovenians were gaining confidence after tough play-off battles with Bulgaria and Russia.
In August of this year, the Slovenians lost 1:3 to the Poles in the Olympic qualification in Gdańsk, but they avenged their defeat at home. But now Stožica will leave the sold-out Ljubljana arena. After today, however, they have a certain second medal in history, in Paris they can improve on the unexpected silver from the EC four years ago.
At the previous European championship, the Slovenians finished eighth, only behind the Czech national team.
Tech companies want to rule our cities
Francis Fukuyama has been somewhat burned by history. In 1992, at the height of the wave of liberalism that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, this political scientist wrote in his most famous book, The End of History and the Last Man: &quot;What we may be witnessing... is the final point of humanity&#39;s ideological development and the universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the ultimate form of government.&quot;
Twenty-six years later, we are rather witnessing how, from the USA to Russia, from Turkey to Poland and from Hungary to Italy, rather illiberal models are winning and various forms of nationalism and radicalism are thriving. Fukuyama&#39;s current ninth book, Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment, attempts to cope with the onset of these forces. As his interview by George Eaton for the New Statesman shows, he is rethinking many of his former positions: he argues that the ideas of socialism should be brought back into the public sphere, and Marx was right about a lot. Although at the same time he insists that his thought development is still in line with the position of the nineties and that the critics of The End of History and The Last Man have misunderstood it.
&quot;What I was saying back then was that one of the problems with modern democracy is that while it provides peace and prosperity, people want more than that... Liberal democracy doesn&#39;t even try to define what the good life is. It leaves it they see no point in individuals who feel alienated, and therefore group themselves into identity groups that give them a sense of belonging.&quot;
In its time, the book The End of History and the Last Man was written as a strong argument against Marxists who saw communism as the final stage of history. When asked how he now sees the rise of socialists in Britain and the US, Fukuyama replies: &quot;It all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we&#39;re talking about ownership of the means of production, then except when clear public services are in demand, that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to work. But if you mean redistributive programs that try to address the huge imbalances in income and wealth that we&#39;re already seeing, then yes. I not only think he could come back, he should come back. The long the period that was ushered in by President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher, in which certain types of ideas about the benefits of the unregulated market came into play, had a disastrous effect in many ways.&quot;
Finally, Fukuyama tries to calm down the current situation and warns all liberals that even the emergence of new, not entirely democratic regimes will not mean the end of history.
Soldiers rehearse, draw the curtains. China is preparing celebrations at the site of the massacre
The army rehearsed the parade during recent weekends. Shops in central Beijing were forced to close and residents near the square were ordered to close their curtains. Military vehicles rolled down the empty streets to the square and warplanes circled in the sky.
Several Chinese told Reuters they were proud to see their country flaunt its military might. But one woman said it was hard to deny that the celebrations would make other states uneasy.
Apparently she was referring to Taiwan, which China claims and where elections are coming up. But they may also have concerns in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, where thousands of people repeatedly demonstrate against the Chinese-appointed administrator.
Celebrations are also being prepared outside of Beijing. The southern Chinese port of Xiamen already put on a special light show on Thursday night. Xiamen lies opposite the island of Taiwan and is among the ten most innovative Chinese cities.
Before the anniversary, the list of forbidden things grows. It already has drones, balloons, kites, alcohol, walkie-talkies and devices using radio waves, The Guardian pointed out. He added that the popular Chinese social network Weibo was deleting &quot;harmful political information&quot;.
&quot;It&#39;s another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party remains (at the helm) against all odds,&quot; said China historian Maura Cunningham. &quot;It is a time when the party can demonstrate order, control and power,&quot; she added.
The People&#39;s Republic of China was established in 1949 when the Communists under Mao Zedong won a battle against Chiang Kai-shek&#39;s Nationalists, who retreated to Taiwan.
In the second half of the 1960s, China underwent a disastrous communist experiment in the form of the so-called Cultural Revolution. In June 1989, the regime massacred thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators from the ranks of students and workers with tanks in Tiananmen Square.
Since the late 1970s, China has increasingly adopted elements of a capitalist economy. According to critics, it is now a mixture of the worst of communism (monopoly of one party and persecution of the opposition) and (Dickensian) capitalism (exploitation of workers).
Czechs or children are not allowed to enter. ČOI revealed discrimination in restaurants
These included, for example, misinformation about prices and failure to comply with the principles of fair sales.
In one case of discrimination, a restaurant in Prague refused to allow smaller children into the establishment. According to ČOI, it writes on its website that the device is not suitable for children under the age of eight. &quot;In response to the consumer&#39;s electronic inquiry as to whether it is possible to order a table for four adults and one four-year-old child at the said restaurant, the restaurant employee replied electronically that they do not accept the presence of children under the age of eight in the restaurant,&quot; added Fröhlich.
In the second case, another Prague company did not want to allow Czech-speaking people to the table, while it allowed English-speaking people to do so. &quot;Czech-speaking inspectors, in the position of consumers, were not allowed to sit at the table in the restaurant and place an order. English-speaking consumers were allowed to do so,&quot; the ČOI spokesperson described the situation.
Both cases are now being resolved in administrative proceedings. Since they have not yet been legally terminated, the inspector&#39;s spokesman could not provide more detailed information about the mentioned restaurants.
However, discrimination appeared only in a very small part of the restaurants inspected in the second quarter. In total, ČOI carried out 139 inspections. In addition to the mentioned two cases of discrimination, it revealed other misconduct in 64 cases. These were mostly deficiencies in compliance with the principles of fair sales and failure to inform the consumer about the prices of products and services in accordance with the regulations.
Already on Wednesday, the inspectorate reported on cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffé and Café Restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged higher amounts than Czech-speaking clients. Legal fines of 60,000 crowns have already been imposed in these cases.
Going on holiday with only a credit card? NEO account offers free ATM withdrawals worldwide!
According to surveys, roughly half of all Czechs who go abroad have gotten used to paying directly by card. The main reasons include mainly convenience, security, but also the possibility of using travel insurance, which is often associated with a payment card.
The convenience of paying by card can be appreciated by travelers in almost all corners of the world. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, but today payment cards are accepted almost everywhere. &quot;People who travel more often, for example for work, do not have time to repeatedly go to exchange offices to exchange cash. And even &quot;vacationers&quot; do not want to rely on the fact that they will have enough cash. In addition, some foreign currencies are not even available in Czech banks or exchange offices. With the NEO account, we have therefore solved it so that its users can withdraw cash from all ATMs for free, no matter where they are,&quot; says Kateřina Petko, director of marketing and communications and spokesperson for Expobank CZ.
In addition, a payment card is a much more reliable way of not losing your money than cash. If a full wallet is lost, its owner does not have to wait any longer for the money he carried in it. However, if he only loses his payment card, he can easily block it immediately by phone or via internet banking. If you act quickly, you don&#39;t have to suffer any financial loss at all. &quot;Keeping money in a bank account has other advantages in addition to its reliable protection. For example, the NEO account has an interest rate of 1.6% per year, which is one of the highest among current and savings accounts. It can be set up and managed completely online without the need to visit a branch. In addition, the money in the bank account is insured up to 100,000 euros, and account management is completely free,&quot; adds Kateřina Petko.
For anyone who is going to go abroad, travel insurance should be a matter of course. Thanks to the possibility to arrange it and pay by card online, it can be done even at the last minute. However, just owning a payment card often means insurance protection when traveling. &quot;For example, with the embossed MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business cards, travel insurance is an integral part of foreign trips to all countries of the world. Holders of these cards can also insure their family with whom they are traveling. This often eliminates any further arrangements,&quot; adds Kateřina Petko from Expobank CZ. However, it is always advisable to check the scope of the given insurance, i.e. whether it covers all activities that travelers plan to undertake.
We are looking for motivated immigrants. The priority of the children&#39;s clinic is built by an international team of doctors, we bring their stories
Albanian Ledjona Toni studied medicine in Czech, and today few people recognize that she is a foreigner.
Hundreds of medics from abroad study in the Czech Republic and could stay and work here. The pediatric clinic in Prague&#39;s Motol tried to get some of them.
In order for Tara Hussein Tayeb to arrive around five o&#39;clock in the afternoon at the Motol hospital in Prague, she had to get up a lot. A Kurdish woman with short-cropped hair flew to the Czech Republic from Sulaymaniyah, a city in northeastern Iraq, where she works as a pediatrician in a hospital and in the afternoon treats small patients in a private practice. In addition, he teaches at the university.
Spilková in a pair. In Indianapolis, he is on the verge of promotion after the first round
After the first round of the Tech Championship tournament in Indianapolis, golfer Klára Spilková is on the verge of advancing to the final rounds. On Thursday, she made two birdies, two bogeys and finished the opening day at even par at the LPGA Series event. With a score of 72, he is tied for 69th place, which is the expected cut.
Twenty-four-year-old Spilková returned to the circuit a month ago after a two-month medical break and did not make it to the second half of the tournament in Portland. She took a rest due to fatigue and exhaustion after a temporary illness.
The first Czech winner of a professional tournament on the European LET series is a member of the LPGA Tour for the first year and so far she is not doing very well. Out of twelve tournaments, she passed the cut three times, her best being 32nd in Hawaii. He is thus fighting to keep his card for the next season.
The tournament in Indianapolis was played best by Korean Hor Mi-chung. After the first round, she has a score of -9 and is two shots ahead of her three opponents.
The Prague Stock Exchange grew slightly, Czech banks, O2 and Avast did well
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the trading week with a slight increase. The PX index rose by 0.13 percent to 1038.45 points. It was pulled up by Czech banks, the telecommunications company O2 and the technology company Avast. On the contrary, Austrian titles and media company CME did not do well. It follows from the results of trading on the exchange&#39;s website.
For most of Friday&#39;s session, the Prague Stock Exchange traded in a slightly positive territory and ended with a small profit. &quot;Nevertheless, it (the PX index) lost a little over one percent for the whole week,&quot; pointed out Josef Dudek from Fio banka.
Domestic banks partially corrected the declines of the past few days. Komerční banka improved by 0.82 percent to 803 crowns and Moneta Money Bank by 0.41 percent to 72.80 crowns. The shares of Avast gained 0.89 percent to 113 crowns, and operator O2 added 0.46 percent to 216.50 CZK.
Kofola&#39;s securities grew the most, by 1.38 percent to 294 crowns. The tobacco company Philip Morris then acquired less than a percent, whose shares rose to 13,640 crowns.
Securities of the energy company ČEZ stagnated at 520 crowns on Thursday.
There were three losses - Erste Bank wrote off 0.87 percent to 779.20 crowns, CME 0.73 percent to 109 crowns and insurance company VIG 0.40 percent to 618 crowns.
The koruna weakened slightly against both major world currencies. The euro lost four pennies to 25.85 CZK/EUR, the dollar lost three pennies to 23.62 CZK/USD. This follows from data on the Patria Online server.
My heart is like a bell and the lungs of a non-smoker. I&#39;ll just take a few infusions, Zeman joked
On Tuesday, the head of state underwent a several-hour medical examination at the Central Military Hospital (ÚVN). According to the director of the hospital, Miroslav Zavoral, the doctors did not find any &quot;disease conditions&quot; in the president. The president will celebrate his 75th birthday on Saturday.
Doctors discovered mild signs of dehydration at the president&#39;s examination. His problems with low pressure were caused precisely by insufficient watering. &quot;In order to further dehydrate my body, I will take several infusions that will get minerals into my body,&quot; said Zeman.
Otherwise, however, according to him, the director of the ÚVN stated that &quot;the Czech state has a healthy president&quot;. In this context, the President mentioned that Zavoral received several hateful messages because of the medical examination.
According to the president, the doctors examined him thoroughly and did not miss a single spot on his body. &quot;So a quick recap: the heart beats like a bell, the lungs are clear as if he&#39;s not a smoker, the liver works as if I&#39;m abstinent, the kidneys are also fine and I can go on and on,&quot; said Zeman.
The editors of iDNES.cz turned to the military hospital to comment on Zeman&#39;s statement about his health.
The question of Zeman&#39;s health became a topic especially at the time of last year&#39;s presidential election or during some public appearances, during which Zeman has obvious problems with walking. According to Prague Castle, the president walks poorly due to diabetic polyfunctional neuropathy. He also has problems with low blood pressure and is hard of hearing. For the sake of his health, he has cut down on smoking.
The researchers are looking for toddlers with a congenital defect, so-called ankle valgus, for their study
Ankle valgus is a congenital defect that affects five to ten percent of children. It is usually treated with intensive exercise. Scientists are trying to help these children even more, so they have developed special shoes that should significantly speed up the treatment.
&quot;We have two prototypes of shoes that will be worn by healthy children and children with a diagnosis in order to map the effect in both groups. At the same time, participating in the research will not have any risks for the children and the measurement will be completely painless,&quot; explains Marta Gimunová, head of research from the Faculty of Sports Studies HIM.
Parents of both groups of children can apply for the study via the website, where a registration form and all information are available.
The researchers are looking for fifty children with the diagnosis and fifty healthy children. Of each group, half will always wear medical shoes and half will not.
&quot;The moment when parents should register their child is the moment when they start taking their first independent steps, typically they start, for example, the furniture that they are holding on to when they try to walk. Participation in the research involves three measurements within seven months of the child&#39;s first steps , each lasting about 20 minutes, for half of the participants it also includes wearing the tested shoes,&quot; points out Gimunová.
A pike in a pond, or a relatively prosperous open-air museum?
Babiš chose statistics for his optimistic view, such as good security (the Czech Republic is seventh in the world), low unemployment rate, low national debt. Or the fact that, according to a recent study, our country is the twenty-fourth in quality of life out of 140 evaluated countries.
Developer Dušan Kunovský and architect Josef Pleskot, in a television interview on the occasion of the Summit of Architecture and Development, however, presented other, not so &quot;rosy&quot; figures. For example, the Czech Republic ranks 154th in the world in the speed of construction procedures. It may thus happen that the current economic &quot;boom&quot; will not leave behind any significant architectural legacy as it was in the past.
The biggest obstacle is not only existing legislation, but also a slow, inefficient bureaucracy. This is also documented by comparative studies, in which the Czech Republic significantly lags behind developed countries in the overall quality and performance of public administration.
Our country has simply not yet been able to make good use of the potential of the good economic situation of recent years to invest in the future. It is nice that salaries and pensions are increasing, but people with an improving standard of living will also want to have a place to live, to travel in a modern and fast way, to have quality cultural stands, to live without an unbearable environmental burden.
But in the capital city of Prague, for example, it has not been possible to complete the inner and outer ring road or to build a high-speed rail or metro to the airport for years. And Prague doesn&#39;t even have a modern, architecturally bold national library, concert hall, or national gallery. The reason is not only the absurd scramble for architectural competitions, spatial plans and building permits, but also a kind of specifically Czech conservatism, which adheres to the motto &quot;every bolder change is for the worse&quot;.
And when it seems that something more daring could be done, it will almost certainly be thwarted by preservationists or other rather foolish associations or politicians. In the absurd drama surrounding Jan Kaplický&#39;s &quot;blob&quot; designed for the new building of the National Library, President Václav Klaus even wanted to tie himself to the diggers.
However, the list does not end with Prague. The Czech Republic is not able to complete its backbone highway network, nor to start building high-speed train lines, so Germany finally decided to run its tracks for super-fast trains from Berlin to Vienna by a &quot;detour&quot; through Bavaria. In addition, repairs to existing infrastructure are sometimes lost in the slenderian. Getting from Prague to Brno quickly is now a solved puzzle.
Babiš entered politics with the promise that he would &quot;fix things&quot;. In terms of meaningful investments and acceleration of cumbersome bureaucratic procedures, not much has happened yet. Although an amendment to the Act on accelerating the construction of transport infrastructure has been in effect since 2018, we will have to wait for more extensive positive effects, such as easier expropriation of land. And the new construction law, approved by the government, which is supposed to reduce the current average length of the construction procedure from 5.4 years to one year, will, if we&#39;re lucky, start to apply from 2021. But many people probably wouldn&#39;t bet on it .
Uncombed wants 45 million from the state
According to Vladimír Řepka&#39;s office spokesperson, the Ministry of Justice has so far received six requests in this connection and is now analyzing them. The young man was in prison for two years for assaulting a woman, but the justice finally acquitted him.
Neither the Supreme Prosecutor Pavel Zeman nor the Minister of Justice Marie Benešová filed an appeal in the case.
The attempted murder of a hairdresser in Hořice took place in February 2013. The Hradec prosecutor&#39;s office charged a then 20-year-old student at the Nečesané grammar school. The prosecution claimed that he hit the woman in the head several times with a log and then took over ten thousand crowns from her. The seriously injured woman was found by her son, her life was saved by the doctors of the hospital in Hradec Králové.
Uncombed from the beginning, he denied any guilt. &quot;I am innocent and I swear to that. I am sincerely sorry for what happened to the victim, but I am not the perpetrator,&quot; said the young man earlier in court, who did not deny that there was a fateful day in the hair salon. He said he wanted to get a haircut. But he left after the woman told him she was already closing. He then reported himself to the police as a witness.
At first, the hairdresser did not recognize him as the aggressor during the interrogation, but later identified Nečesané as the attacker. According to forensic experts, she suffered memory lapses after the attack.
The Hradec Regional Court successively handed down five judgments in the case. First, he found Nečesané guilty twice and sentenced him to 16 years in prison, the Supreme Court of Appeal reduced his sentence to 13 years. Necesaný gradually went behind bars twice, but each time he was released after the intervention of the Supreme Court. After the ordered replacement of the trial panel, repeated acquittals were eventually handed down, with the last one upheld by the Supreme Court in March of this year.
At the same time, the chairman of the appeals panel, Jiří Lněnička, stated in the justification of his conclusions that this decision was wrong, but due to the procedural situation, he said he had no better option. He said he dismissed the prosecutor&#39;s appeal against the acquittal, even though her appeals were valid.
&quot;The problem with this case is not a lack of evidence, but its assessment. We believe that a sufficient amount of evidence was collected in the preliminary proceedings, which would be more than sufficient for a guilty plea in another criminal case,&quot; stated Lněnička.
However, the Hradec High Court, as well as the Supreme Court, looked at the case differently, and their opinion would probably not be changed by the further annulment of the acquittal.
Epilepsy complicated his love of sports, thanks to the operation he has new hope
Honzík&#39;s parents first noticed that something was wrong with him when he was a year and a half old. He always stared into space for several minutes, became motionless and did not respond to anyone. The pediatrician therefore sent him to a children&#39;s neurology clinic, where the doctors diagnosed him with epilepsy after a series of examinations and immediately put him on medication, but it did not work immediately.
It took almost a year for doctors to find the perfect combination of drugs that made him stop having seizures completely. At the age of five, the doctors stopped his medication, and since the seizures did not return, his parents assumed that Honza was healthy and began to encourage him to do more sports. He rode a bike, skied, played tennis and floorball, spent his free time playing games with his sister and friends. But at the age of eleven he had another seizure and everything started anew.
The doctors tried different combinations of drugs again, but this time nothing worked, the seizures in the form of absences kept recurring. Since Honzo always lost consciousness during a seizure, the parents were terrified that he would get it while playing sports and get injured. Gradually, Honza stopped riding a bicycle and exchanged downhill skis for cross-country skis and a snowboard. Although the sport gave him fits from time to time, he never completely gave it up. He even fulfilled his dream and finished the Spartan Race, but together with a friend who kept an eye on him to help in case of emergency.
When Honzo was 15 years old, his parents decided to try to change doctors and turned to experts at the General Hospital in Motola. After a series of examinations, the doctors there concluded that Honza was a candidate for surgery to remove the tumor from his brain - the source of epileptic seizures. &quot;I had to undergo 2 operations in a row, first the doctors inserted probes into my brain that sensed its activity, then they could remove the bearing. It was a few weeks of hell for me. I just had to lie down and hardly move, wires were sticking out of my head , which were connected to the computer,&quot; recalls Honza.
The operation was successful, and the doctors removed the rather extensive deposit. &quot;The first days after the operation it was very mentally demanding, Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and almost did not speak. Compared to how lively and communicative he is normally, it was a scary change, but luckily everything returned to normal after a few days,&quot; he describes mom and adds: &quot;He had 1 seizure a month and a half after the surgery, but according to the doctors it happens. He has been seizure free for 3 months since then.&quot;
This school year, Honza will graduate, in addition to sports, he enjoys languages and has started working with Company E, with whom he goes to schools for talks about epilepsy. Honza is not fully involved in sports activities yet, he is slowly returning to sports. &quot;I&#39;m learning how to do sports correctly, how to breathe well so that I don&#39;t expose my body to sudden stress, which is quite a challenge with my competitive nature,&quot; explains Honza.
This year, therefore, he will not actively participate in the traditional EPPI paddling triathlon, where patients with epilepsy and healthy athletes meet, and which is already taking place this weekend, September 28, 2019, at Veselská pískovna. But maybe next year.
XXX Lutz can buy competitor Kiko, the authority has allowed. But there is a catch
&quot;The Office for the Protection of Economic Competition allowed the merger of the competitors - XLCEE-Holding GmbH on the one hand, and Kika Furniture and Lambda Properties Czechia on the other - under the condition of fulfilling the structural obligations established in favor of maintaining effective competition,&quot; said ÚOHS spokesman Martin Švanda.
XLCEE- Holding owns Möbelix stores in addition to the XXX Lutz chain. If it were to absorb the Kika chain as well, it would occupy too large a share of the Czech market for furniture and accessories. That&#39;s why he has to sell off part of the company he&#39;s buying.
XLCEE-Holding also buys Kika branches in other countries where the chain operates, i.e. in Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. Even there, the transaction must be approved by the antimonopoly authorities. The purchase of 22 foreign branches of the Kika chain from the Signa holding was announced by XXX Lutz in May. Signa took over the failing Kiku last year for a nominal price.
The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is number two after the Swedish company IKEA. Before it was taken over by the Austrian company Signa, it belonged to the South African company Steinhoff International Holdings since 2013. She faced problems when she revealed irregularities in her accounting. Kika has nine stores in the Czech Republic.
XXX Lutz has been operating in the Czech Republic since 2010. Alongside the companies IKEA, Sconto, Jysk and Asko-Nábytek and Kika, it belongs to the largest furniture sellers on the domestic market. The Möbelix brand has the same owner. After taking over Kika&#39;s foreign branches, XXX Lutz will already operate over 300 department stores in 12 countries. According to the company&#39;s website, its annual turnover is 4.4 billion euros (about 114 billion CZK).
The library commemorates the anniversary of the death of Wenceslas IV. exhibition of manuscripts
Six rare historical manuscripts from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, i.e. from the time of the Roman and Czech king Wenceslas IV, can be viewed by people in Prague&#39;s Klementin today and on Saturday. The National Library released them from its vaults to commemorate this year&#39;s 600th anniversary of Wenceslas&#39; death. This morning, librarians and restorers placed rare originals in display cases in the Chapel of Mirrors. Entrance to the exhibition is free, it is open on both days from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.
An exhibition of documents entitled Ad mandatum domini Regis: From the royal office and library of Wenceslas IV. prepared by the library together with the National Archives. On a written legacy from the reign of Wenceslas IV. the National Archives looks at it from the point of view of official documents and the National Library from the point of view of literary works, its author Jan Vojtíšek said about the exhibition.
&quot;Visitors can look forward to, for example, a work on agriculture by Peter de Crescentiis, which is essentially a kind of encyclopedia of agriculture, or a breviary, i.e. a prayer book of one of the Benedictines of the St. George&#39;s Monastery at Prague Castle, from the beginning of the 15th century,&quot; he listed reasons why people should see the exhibition according to him.
The Epistles of Peter of Blois will also be exhibited, where the opening miniature H (enrico) depicts a half-figure of the English king Henry II. The author of the decoration is most likely the Master of Samson&#39;s History, who, next to the two volumes of the Bible of Wenceslas IV. he also participated in the decoration of a number of other manuscripts. Visitors will also see a collection of Latin treatises by John Wycliffe from around 1411 to 1414.
From the library of Wenceslas IV. not a single book has survived on Czech territory. According to experts, this library belonged to the most extensive and also the most beautiful book collections in Central Europe at the time, because the young king was eager to build a representative library that would equal the book collections of his French relatives. However, the library disappeared soon after Václav&#39;s death. Apparently, it was stolen or destroyed during the capture of the castle by the Hussites. But several codices were saved. Today, the Austrian National Library owns most of them.
&quot;We have a number of treasures in our collections and I am glad that they are in a condition that allows them to be displayed and made available to the public so-called live and not only in the form of the Manuscriptorium digital library,&quot; said Martin Kocanda, director of the National Library.
On the day of Saturday&#39;s public holiday, an exhibition called What&#39;s hiding under the floor, which presents local archaeological discoveries, will be open for free in Klementin.
Kristýna Plíšková did not make it to the finals, the second title still eludes her
The plush environment in Tashkent proved it, in 2016 she won her first tournament on the WTA circuit here and this year she performed very confidently.
After wins with Paolini, Kawa and Kužmova, she fought her way into the top four players.
But the match with Alison Van Uytvancková did not go well for Kristýn. The Belgian held her serve and broke Plíšková&#39;s serve twice in the first set. In the second set, Van Uytvancková soon took a 3-0 lead and Kristýna was unable to turn it around, even though she managed to convert one break point in the end. In the last one, she averted one match point, but the end came in the second one.
Petra Černocká changed her image and did well! She looked younger in her fair hair
Film Saxana Petra Černocká (69) looks absolutely fantastic for her age. Even though she will celebrate her life anniversary in November, she never looked like a retiree. And now she helped it even more. She changed her image until her colleagues did not recognize her.
The actress Petra Černocká never looked like a typical grandmother who had gray hair, wore settled things and went out sporadically in society. She has always taken care of herself and the older she gets, the more she can loosen up in terms of her image.
Fortunately, she did not succumb to the trend of plastic surgery and takes care of her skin with the help of good old Indulona. And her anti-wrinkle recipe is paying off. But now she changed the color of her hair and looked completely new.
When she came to a social event where celebrities said goodbye to summer, no one could recognize Petra. Not only did she have lighter and shorter hair, but she was also dressed in a yellow coat that made her shine even more.
Ladies should learn from Saxana how not to underestimate themselves, that even at the threshold of seventy they can take risks with their appearance. And it paid off for Petra, she looks at most fifty.
