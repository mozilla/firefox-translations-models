Prague Stock Exchange plummets into a negative at the end of trading
After a sharp drop in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions with CEZ's shares amounted to almost half of the daily business.
The Prague Stock Exchange followed up its slump on Monday's slump from the start of Tuesday's trading, falling by nearly six percent.
This time, the decline is due to a drop in Wall Street shares.
Here, too, the market reaction to the outcome of the U.S. House of Representatives vote is emerging, which refused to support a plan to stabilise the financial sector there.
Share Fall in Asia
Stores in the Asia stock market-based dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indexes eventually erased some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng stock exchange index in Hong Kong was off nearly four percent in the course of trading, but later erased some of its losses and the downturn reduced to around 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the Chinese stock market movements in Hong Kong, fell 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
Stocks on the Sydney stock exchange were down more than five percent, but eventually fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock exchange fell 3.6 percent, according to the country's index.
"The timing of the rescue operation in the US is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide," noted Hong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, sets monetary policy on its own, without depending on China's central bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudi, US lawmakers should return to negotiations and approve the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, he said, there is a risk that other countries will feel the effects.
Blood baths of American shares
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was to be spent up to $700 billion (nearly $12 trillion).
Lawmakers thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
US stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, with major stock indexes marking the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell nearly seven percent, and it fell to a similar scale as recently as 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but once it became clear that the bill had failed in the House, the index found itself in a free fall.
Congress backs down: US government may pump $700 billion into banks
The leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the US financial system.
It will be voted on at the beginning of next week.
US lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks to approve a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system in the amount of $700 billion (approximately $12 trillion).
However, it is not yet won.
In fact, congressmen must complete some of the details of the agreement before they can release and vote on the final form of the bill.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed at the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
The Senate, according to sources, could probably vote on the plan on Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be approved should be the first major psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
However, thereafter, it will be "cut-cut" by the complexity of the mechanisms to help markets achieve in practice.
Paulson: Plan must be effective
"We've made a lot of progress.
We have solved our differences of opinion on what the shape of the package to stabilise the market should look like," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could be reached later on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday to give the final shape to the government's fund.
This should buy back from financial corporations for non-negotiable mortgage assets that pull financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the brink of a definitive agreement of the plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue the recovery plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Signal for Asian trading
The global financial crisis is hitting stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the non-GaTA senator Harry Reid, legislators are thus trying to reach a final agreement in Congress later on Sunday.
Indeed, they want to reassure investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone, where Congress's decision could affect Monday's trading.
But it is not yet clear with certainty when the two chambers of the US Congress will vote on the bill, nor whether they can't get a last-minute negotiation stuck on a problem.
Lawmakers hope it will be passed in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo a number of changes.
The total amount to be aided to the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
But Congress may block the release of the remaining amount if it is under the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function, in a run of another $100 billion and later a final $350 billion.
Bush praised progress in negotiations
While the president may veto the decision, Congress may override his veto.
But despite these changes, the basic idea behind the program, which was to raise funds to buy back bad mortgage securities, the value of which has plummeted because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, have been preserved.
"We've worked it all out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said that Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciated the "binary effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restrictions on golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the head of negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed to the responsibility for the monetary program, the protection of taxpayers' losses, the closure of the concessions, the timing of the plan's financing.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes for the directors participating in the programme and sets up a committee to supervise the fund.
This should be run by the Treasury Department.
"We have worked very hard at this and have made great progress towards a deal that will work and will be useful for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also envisages assistance for homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new repayments for the mortgages it will buy in order to reduce the monthly hire purchase costs for borrowers and allow them to keep their houses.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to David Mark, the chief economist of Patria Finance, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"And that's because it's not known by what mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government will split the losses between them," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the start of next week is not all that important, according to Mark.
"More importantly, this week's congressmen agree to support the plan and to sanction it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on the fact that approval will take place is the most important at the moment," Marek stressed.
The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, with a combined total of 29 percent
The noticeable weakening of the two parties of the previous grand coalition and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties was brought about by Sunday's early parliamentary elections in Austria, according to the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly strong losses, with the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer shaking up seriously.
In contrast, the election leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Carinthian Governor Jörg Haider is planning a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the strongest party in the country of social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party with 29.8 percent of the vote, but it loses 5.5 percent of the vote against the latest elections in 2006.
The ÖVP fared even worse, losing almost nine per cent of the vote with 25.6 per cent.
These are the worst results of both of these major parties in Austria's post-war history and, especially for the Peoples who called for the early elections, a literally disastrous result.
As recently as the beginning of July, when the ÖVP withdrew from the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable lead in their preferences over the SPÖ.
But voters apparently punished them for letting the government fail.
Early reactions to the results were speculated about the possible resignation of the party's chairman and incumbent vice-chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe this could happen as early as Monday at a special meeting of the party's bureau.
Such a development would probably facilitate the path to the still most likely way out of the election result, the renewal of the grand coalition of the SPÖ and the ÖVP.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ), they received a preliminary 18 percent of the vote and the BZÖ eleven per cent - the Social Democrats also voiced concerns about the repetition of the years in 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (then the FPÖ was unified, in 2005, it was split from the BZÖ) in a joint government that even provoked sanctions from the European Union.
Haider is clearly betting on this development, having already said he was ready to work with any party and anticipates a return to Vienna for national politics.
The Green Party was still in the parliament, but it lost easily and fell between the Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
Neither of the other parties apparently surpassed the 4% threshold and made it to parliament.
Clash for a knife-edge: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We will advise you on how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make the phone call.
This makes it clear that it's better to buy just a phone.
Still, there are enough reasons to get a stand-alone player.
The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and the prospects of the prospective owner.
It's probably hard to get a top-of-the-line, expensive record player to listen to the latest album Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such music products do not work on LP boards, and there is no objective reason for this in qualitative terms.
However, if vinyls with art rock, jazz or blues are weaving on your shelves, you are probably at least dreaming of such a gramophone.
It is the same with the music on the road, i.e. the music compressed, simplified - by music in MP3.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
It may be unacceptable for some to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan is unlikely to bite the headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, with enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide.
It also decides the battery endurance
Some top-of-the-line music players can do much more than just play music, but what most mobile phones can do.
No current device is as versatile as the phone.
In addition to the primary features, phone calls and texting, he can play music and video, record both, have a better one, the worse camera and maybe even navigate.
And taking into account smartphones and commuters, you'll also have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, no refrigerator can grill, and no TV shoots anything.
The versatility of the mobile also brings drawbacks.
The more features you use on your mobile, the sooner the indicator on the display sends you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the greatest energy eaters.
Few mobiles can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, usually a lot less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap mobiles, therefore, expect them not to play for more than a few hours.
If you call for it here and there, get one more charger for work just in case - that's for the more expensive devices.
You won't have this problem with MP3 players, and the worse ones can withstand at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation on a single charge.
Another problem comes when recording music to a mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not every one of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be uploaded directly to the memory card, but few card readers can handle the miniature memory cards used on mobile phones without reduction.
For players, with some exceptions (iPod), you do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobiles and players already create a music library by themselves, ranked by the name of the artist, album title, genre or user reviews.
Some devices only display the tree structure of the directories in the same way as the Explorer in Windows, and some know how to do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with the operating system).
Players are easier to operate, mobile phones are more good
When choosing a particular device, take particular interest in the battery life, memory capacity, quality and the type of sound output, and, of course, the comfort of the control.
If the music is primarily a backdrop to you and if you only listen to it every day briefly on the tram, you only need any mobile phone that plays MP3.
Which is really almost a mobile phone can already do.
Nor do you have to watch much of what music formats a mobile or player can do.
MP3 can do all of them, and the vast majority of the music that reaches you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widely used and, in addition to it, the vast majority of the devices can also master music in the WMA format.
Less is AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy online music.
Just visit the relevant operator's (or other provider) pages via the mobile internet and purchase the song or album.
This service could already be a strong case in itself for acquiring a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the operators' offer is poor and is mostly limited to speeding-capable radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether through GSM, the internet or wireless internet) that this is the way of selling music for the future.
Mobile most people carry with them all the time.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you feel the mobile phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least wired handsfree with you.
If not, you can use the integrated speaker that almost every mobile phone has, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of music mobileism will be the price for many.
The cheapest ones normally cost under three grand.
For three and four thousand crowns, you can already get a very decent walkman.
But you will usually be limited by the absence of output to regular headphones.
The best and, technically, the most equipped phones with a 3.5 mm slot for regular headphones cost up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of players, among other things, is easy operation.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can be controlled by really everyone.
The minimal functionality, the similarity of the controls to the previously common cassette player or perhaps the gramophone is obvious.
There is no risk of collisions in the form of an accidentally switched-on mobile internet and then a huge account for data transmission.
What machine to reach for
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually has a slot on interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the appropriate card, you can fit into two thousand crowns.
But beware.
For basic models, only 2 GB of maximum capacity is supported.
Only the most expensive ones can handle 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creativa, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
By capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than £1,100.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, should you rather reach for specialized mobiles - walkmen (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs).
These devices have separate control buttons for the MP3 and the comfort of the operator is thus close to a standalone MP3 player.
The furthest is in the Sony Ericsson field, whose walkman-series has the same user interface as the self-sold MP3 players sold.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (tri normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours), the MP3 players will be taken away from the above-mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Yet we are missing something here - a virtual operator that would make the classic ones cheaper.
He may not be missed for long.
We have written about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe at Mobil.cz many times.
Indeed, this was confirmed by ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price of SMS in our country is higher than in the rest of the Union.
Following the European Commission's latest steps in the field of regulating roaming charges, a paradoxical situation may be: for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are holding so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to go into battle.
It may sound paradoxical, we have three mobile networks and penetrating up to 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, are happy to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecoms Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák often rings in this, who has commented several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network does not seem to have much chance (after all, it would be hard to find frequencies anymore).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought a significant price reduction, to which even classical operators had to respond.
At the same time, before the entry of the pike like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, there were similar voices in the UK as in the UK.
But it turns out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
After all, we don't have to go too far for examples.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, the operator has managed to recruit more than 100,000 customers and become the country's fifth largest operator.
At the same time, the financial group Penta, which owns U:fona, among others, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, they only need far fewer customers than a classical operator.
They do not entail the relatively high cost of the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators tend to profile themselves as low-cost - offering cheap calls and SMS, but this is often counterbalanced by a closer service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half as much as its competitors.
But, as the example of Mobilelogisation in Poland shows, a bet on a novel target group can also be a pretty good move.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
"Security guys choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, operating in this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if a similar concept could be caught up in our country.
Vodafone's press spokesperson Miroslav Čepický doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segmental approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offerings."
No chance in the Czech Republic, say mobile operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very hopeful.
Rather, it will be launched by Mobileping in other countries of our region," Jana Studničková, press spokesperson for the financial group Penta, told Mobil.cz in a telephone interview.
It impresively confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are certainly not in favour of this idea.
Rather the opposite, they try to do their best to prevent any potential competitor from being created.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile operator has not been hared by the GTS Novera group for a long time, which would like to take the next step to become a real competitor to Telefónica O2 in the corporate customer sector.
"We have a great interest in being able to offer not only fixed telecommunications services to our customers, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already managed to make progress in the negotiations with some of them," says the group's press spokesperson, Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe there's a glimmer of better days.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual operator should be looking forward to perhaps by the end of the year.
For the time being, however, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room for a fully-fledged virtual operator to be created on the Czech market.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, no entity has approached us with a comprehensive and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sršeň of the Telefónica O2 press department said in his comments to Mobil.cz.
The specificity of the Czech market is also invoked by other operators.
T-Mobile's press spokesperson Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not yet recorded any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which to be further built."
He adds: "It is difficult for a virtual operator to appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this point, we'd have to have a concrete agreement on the table to consider in this short term."
Vodafone is more likely to focus its attention on its own 3G licence requirements.
Miroslav Čepický says: "By negotiating with potential virtual operators, we are open, especially in the area of burden and infrastructure sharing.
We consider this to be the most beneficial in terms of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The progress of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, leading to a fall in prices and thus a decline in their profits.
So why facilitate the emergence of such a competitor?
The fact that when operators are at a loss, they can pull together, is also evidenced by the tussle over the formation of the U:fona.
Perhaps the biggest pressure towards ČTÚ was at the time of the creation of U:fona from T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the ČTÚ website.
But now it is U:fon who fits as an argument for not allowing a virtual operator to.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive mobile market environment was recently amplified by the entry of a fourth mobile operator to the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another player would make high demands on him and, above all, his services."
However, given this approach by the mobile operators, the sheer complete disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is a striking one.
This is not just the position of ČTÚ, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other developed countries - does not have the power to intervene in competition.
These are exclusively owned by the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS).
But he took his typical stance on the whole issue.
"A virtual operator's entry into the mobile market would be possible after a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator for the lease of the necessary infrastructure were concluded.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential bidders was probably not interesting enough for classical operators," Kristián Chalupa from the External Relations Department of the OOHS said in response to our question.
The comments thus formulated will come as no surprise to the representatives of the operators.
It is more from the authority, which is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses their position in the market, it is more than a precarious one.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the country, where virtual operators normally operate, we can see that their market entry has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephone services."
But the pressure to properly operate the market environment and the price drop are not among the interests of the OBR.
In fact, the shocking thing about the case is the touching harmony of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is entirely self-evident.
Like the exact same price of petrol at petrol stations, it is surely just a matter of chance and a tough competitive fight.
"The office did not find any signs of anti-competitive conduct in this case and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore has no adequate increased responsibility for its market conduct.
The necessary tools to open the mobile market for virtual operators are most likely missing from the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in his comments.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets produced by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is the only market in terms of competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer a different perspective - the creation of a virtual operator always requires the approval of the network operator.
And the mobile operator - quite logically, has a monopoly on its network.
So in a segment, it necessarily has to be dominant.
But even if we did not allow this argument, it should be minimally cautionary tale for the OBR that the three mobile operators are doing strikingly similarly.
At the same time, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned GTS Novera) show that they face very similar obstacles when dealing with all operators.
The upload of responsibility at ČTÚ is then a rather common trick in telecommunications, with the ÚOHS taking its hands off the whole affair.
We've met him on several occasions like this.
Unfortunately, until the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, the extension of ČTÚ's powers to competition in telecommunications failed to enforce, although many experts promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the OHS must know this more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It goes when no one is watching
At the same time, the operation of some pseudo-ovirtual operators, of which there are several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile phone services, but they are only partially public.
It is usually about multilevel marketing companies.
It offers its own mobile phone services, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others.
The price lists of these firms usually reach the elect.
The magic is that the company acts as a classic corporate customer to the operator, who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a major customer, they will then receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators forbid a similar reschance.
"If there were cases of which you are talking about, it could be a violation of the contractual terms that we would deal with and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemrová said in response to our question on the problem.
But it is unlikely that such action would be brought to accountable to responsible people from mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators is opposed to such a procedure.
They make significant profits from the activities of these firms, and yet - unlike actual virtual operators - they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculation, however, the services of these companies are used by only a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone is not in their name, so they cannot dispose of it fully as ordinary customers of mobile operators."
But that is what should be at least strange to ČTÚ.
In addition, another question is being raised for the OBR.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to a similar procedure, why are they blocking the emergence of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the OBR has quite strong powers to detect such an activity, and if it does not want to, it may not be content with the operators' explanation that they have no idea about this and their terms of trade prohibit it.
When we won't be the most expensive
As the text has already been mentioned several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a noticeable decline in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually every country where virtual operators were created, the classical operators tried to hinder their creation more or less.
The arguments used by them were virtually identical - too small, or perhaps too saturated, quality problems of service, etc.
But it was in these early countries that regulators intervened at these moments, defending not the interests of mobile operators, but of their customers.
Whether by formal measures or informal pressure, they then achieved the creation of the first virtual operator and others pack in on it.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators are tossing the case around like a hot potato.
We cannot escape the perception in our experience that ambiguity in the competencies is more than suited to them in these cases.
But let's not throw a gun in the Rye.
If behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator will really appear in our country soon, the Czech mobile market may be moving up again.
If one of the operators admitted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the OBR to remain indifferent to reject (discrimination) of other candidates.
And we may stop calling for more than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four performances of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of Czech Statehood Day solemnly presented new recordings of the national anthem Where My Home.
The anthem was newly recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in the chorus and instrumental wording.
The singer was taken in by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anthem's modifications are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymen.
He had previously told Czech Radio that he had deliberately chosen to sing solo variants for singing solo variants by the singers with young representative voices, which are distinctive and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that they were clearly dical about both of them at the beginning, to make the text feel good, to resonate," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where My Home was first performed on the boards of the Estates Theatre in 1834 in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by music by František Škroup.
She gained popularity and people spontaneously embraced it.
The first verse of the song then became a natural part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven national symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What the "new" anthem is
Prague's public transport will also take a ride on the chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday 1. October 2008 will go down in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the first passengers who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket will take over.
This can be purchased at this point by roughly 100,000 people who own the Opencard.
Passengers can buy the 30-day and 90-day and 90-day and annual coupon (which will apply from 1 January 2009 and at the same time have their chip card uploaded to their chip card in the Transport Company's information and workplaces at the Muzeum, Můstek metro stations, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can also be bought via the internet on the Transport Company's website www.dpp.cz from yesterday.
The service was used by over four hundred customers by the afternoon.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget about the outlet windows at the metro stations, where they still had to regularly stand in long queues for paper tickets.
They buy the coupon over the internet and upload it to their Opencard in one of the 13 branches of the Municipal Library.
"At these locations, passengers have a desk with trained service to help those interested with online shopping and also uploaded a coupon purchased to their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to upload electronic coupons to Opencard in self-service dispensaries, which are mounted in several metro vestibules.
What do machines like that look like?
They are red, they resemble ticket markers and the passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavska.
"There are now five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Cautious said.
The coupon checks the driver's seat
The operator of the automata that will start operating tomorrow is simple.
Just slide the Opencard chip card into them and the previously paid coupon will be uploaded to it.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
That is, on the suburban trains and bus lines with the number 300 to 499, which are mainly used to the capital by the residents of the Central Bohemian municipalities.
"On the trains placed in the Prague Integrated Transport, the conductors are equipped with card readers to determine the time and band validity of the coupons," explained ticket check Filip Drápal from the organization Ropid, which assembles the timetables of the Prague public transport.
Suburban buses have card readers built into the driver's ticket office.
When boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the driver the chip card, but it is also necessary to attach the Opencard to the designated place on the side of the cash register.
This will check the validity of the uploaded coupons.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the uploaded coupons, there is nothing easier than to ask the driver for this information," Drápal said.
Passengers who don't take suburban buses and won't remember when their coupon expires can go back to the supermarket machines, where the card coupons are recorded.
Here, the validity of their documents will be shown on the device's display.
Sudetenland wanted a referendum after the US
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 asked for the inclusion of the Sumava in the United States.
This flows from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, in 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the president of the United States.
This is apparent, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive and is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans from Český Krumlov are asking in a letter to the US president not to allow the return of the "Sumava County" - taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and want to be really sure of the words that the American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter, signed in the words "People to whom the fate of Sumava is at his heart" reads."
Since joining Czechoslovakia supposedly gives the Sudeten Germans - in its knowledge of the Czech national character - hope only for the brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter to the US president to take over the Protectorate for the present and eternity over Šumavou.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would admit this territory to a state to a foreign state who oppresses and refutes minorities and nothing has contributed to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of the vindictiveness of the "Czech oppressors."
If the US President reportedly doubted the sentiments of the Sumava Germans, it was enough for him to hold a referendum in the Sumava county about whether its residents wanted to become part of the US or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today's knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses, it appropriately illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least suspect that this would be their expulsion from the republic, few of them even admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and the UK to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others believed they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was during the war as a Budweiser German deployed to the Navy in the Baltic.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Holštýnsk, dozens of other Czech Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they came home, they would need Czech," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, counted on the fact that they would be relegated from the republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don't think - you'll pay!
Emotional campaign to attack drivers
The most expensive event focused on road safety in Czech history.
Even so, one could characterize the emotional media campaign that the Department of Transportation intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček expects her to discourage drivers from behaving himself behind the wheel.
The $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, the cinema, on the internet, but also on the flyers.
It should deter drivers from driving fast and alcohol at the wheel.
And also reminded them to strap themselves in before they leave.
He wants to reach into the conscience primarily for young drivers, bikers, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what will appear in the spots?
Mostly human stories that attack emotions.
This is evidenced by the "bloody" campaign's "bloody" slogan:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "doesn't mean" is written in capital letters on the license plateau.
And in a pool of blood, the word "pay" is.
This is to symbolize that one can pay with one's life in a moment of inattention.
Viewers will be "scare" by the spots until 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where pictures with drastic pictures of accident victims can normally be seen.
It promises to reduce the accident rate and the death toll on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip on the driver
"The driver's sugar and stick system applies.
For them, the sugar is that when they go for a red light, for example, they save time.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořán, a transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative ads are needed, the psychologist says.
Less effective, he says, are the boards that alert drivers to the danger.
"If a static table is installed warning of danger, it will probably soon merges with the surroundings and drivers will not be involved," Kořán pointed out.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The president of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, spoke in favour of returning virtually all territories occupied in 1967, including Pre-Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published by the Jediot Achronot newspaper on Monday.
"We must come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all of them," Olmert told the daily.
"We will leave a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (the territory of Israel) because without it there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and especially doesn't want tractors or bulldozers to run over his legs, as it did for one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert observed, referring to the two attacks in the city in July in which several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places" that lie within the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
That will not work," he stressed further.
Leaving the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel's departure from the Golan Heights, which he said was an essential condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I am not proposing to make peace with Syria only on the basis of leaving the Golan," he cautioned.
"The Syrians know what they'll have to give up to win over the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the (Shunshire Movement) Hezbollah; they will have to give up the lasting support provided by the terrorism (Shunter-Homani movement) to Hamas, to (terrorist networks) to the Al-Qaeda (hogtun wars) in Iraq," the Prime Minister clarified.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool
If the problem with the Czech scientists who were indicted in India for illegally collecting beetles could not be solved, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there would be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister made the comments in New York City after meeting today with his Indian counterpart, Pranaba Mukherdj.
"If this had not been resolved, then yes, then there would have been some cooling," he said after the meeting, which took place on the Czech initiative.
Mukherji said after the hearing that the executive could be too difficult to interfere in the court's affairs.
However, he said that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government in Darjwilling, whose jurisdiction the case falls under.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kucera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best for Mukherji to appeal to a higher instance.
He can then apply for bail and wait for the verdict to be free, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner made the same statement in the negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way for the Czech side to enter into the matter is to provide the convicted with "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that the Indian side was already providing such assistance to them.
"We have the highest interest in maintaining the best relations with India that have a long tradition.
Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told the Czech News Agency, he stressed in front of his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider the imprisonment and indictment of these Czech scientists to be a deep mistake," he said.
The minister avoided answering the question of whether he had received a promise to deal with things from the Indian party.
"I've already made quite a few promises," he said only.
Questions after the accident: Are the stewards on the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know them, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In the wake of the tragic accident involving a Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arose as it was whether the stewards and passengers could move on the bus while driving.
"If we would like to strictly and formally comply with the law, the steward's activity is in violation of the Road Traffic Act," says Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, which was killed by a 22-year-old stewardess last week, was apparently caused by the driver of the lorry who crossed the bus's path.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver at the time, in the least safe place in the car, though she has two more seats reserved.
However, the bus can crash or brake hard, even as the steward is delivering coffee or newspapers.
The role is played by whether the bus is equipped with standing room, according to the technical licence.
If the bus is not homologated, the passenger must sit.
Long-distance buses Student Agency do not have standing seats; which Aktuálně.cz was confirmed by the company's director, Radim Jančura.
"This is what the Ministry and I discussed and at first did not allow the movement of passengers.
We eventually called it off and we came to the conclusion that passengers are allowed to go to the toilet while driving if they have their seat," he said.
The law does not know the steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation addresses this role.
However, no legislation does not even prohibit the carrier from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of the conductor of the vehicle; it does not define its rights and obligations," adds Hanzelka, the spokesperson, less uneventively.
The director of the Road Vehicle Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, thinks that the issue is adequately treated by the law.
"It depends on whether the bus is allowed in the homologation of standing rooms.
That's the end of it," he says.
Buses are divided into urban spaces, where there are room spaces for standing room and limited to maximum speed, with more-standard standing seats and at a long-distance stand without standing at the top speed limit and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like a plane, says expert
BESIP's transport safety expert Jaroslav Hořín, on the move of the stewards on board the bus, does not see a major problem.
"There is not much danger in the smooth ride, the situation can be compared to service on planes.
Even here, it's uncertain when the turbulence will come and the stewardess can hit his head.'
"However, should the bus brake sharply, the laws of physics apply, of course.
As well as on a city bus or a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be addressed by carriers by internal regulations," he says, and also means, from the point of view of the law, the issue is unresolved.
Jančura is willing to cancel services
Student Agency offers stewards services as the sole bus carrier.
He employs two hundred of them.
The director does not consider their profession to be a risk either after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the stewards' profession is risky, I'll cancel them.
Coffee and newspapers can be given to passengers on boarding.
It would also save costs," he says.
As an interest in safety, the absence of stewards in his cars was justified by the director of Asians, Alexei Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA.
"We don't have stewards, we've been against that from the start.
Sooner or later, it will end in some fatal accident," he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
There was a immense tragedy
The accident involving a regular service to Naples was killed by a young stewardess from Pilsen, who had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck probably swung without using a rudder from the breakdown lane and blocked the bus's path.
His driver tried to avoid the maneuver with a violent manoeuvre, but he hit it with the right front.
That two places reserved for the stewards' rest would be sold out, Jančura refuses.
"These seats are not available for long-distance services, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for a court to be sent by the court, but he also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
Law amendment?
Not in sight
Clarifying the movements of the stewards on board the bus could be brought about by an amendment to the law, which has been worked on by the Ministry of Transport's 30-member expert group for over a year.
"There was no concrete conclusion, of course.
Buses don't even deal with much, rather a point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phone while driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards to be something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," concludes Hanzelka, a spokesman, noting that the control of bus safety is under the jurisdiction of the police and the employment safety authorities.
Czech judges fight for seabed
It will approach the wall map, which shows Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
He is not interested in the continent, however, but a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as big as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the 30-member team of staff at the United Nations Ocean and Law Affairs Committee.
His boss, the division's director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and occasionally completes.
There is work drive and enthusiasm.
The seabed hides a hitherto little-known world, rich in natural resources.
There is a search for oil, ore and other minerals, but also still-unknown living organisms that carry the key to developing a cancer drug.
A bottom greater than the land
Coastal states today began to bid in vigorously for the new undersea territories.
According to the UN Convention, they are exercising their rights agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly an area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
It is under the Convention entitled to all the resources of the continental shelf.
"In simple terms, behind the continental shelf is that part of the seabed and its bedrock, which is a natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the coastal sea, often beyond the two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the delimitation of the external borders of the continental shelf must be accompanied by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of a number of years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide legal and technical assistance to the commission.
The Commission has so far dealt with five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the latter three countries have succeeded so far," adds Mikulka.
The world's response was recently the success of Australia, which was the first to substantially expand its undersea holdings.
But New Zealand also gained - the seabed area the commission admitted to it last week is about 1.6 million square kilometres, roughly six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The profit that will flow to them from using the seabed in the future will be, as they sorely promised.
Other states will submit their applications in turn.
They can do so until ten years since they have ratified the "themball of Montego Bay."
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor area, declared a "common heritage of mankind" begins.
Here, no state has an exclusive status.
The right of extraction in this area is conferred by the Convention by an international institution established.
"But the sea floor is no Klondajk," says director Mikulka on the pitch, noting that his "unit areas are legally clearly defined and their regime contractually enshrined."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are sharing them with other states of the former Eastern Bloc as part of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal."
It was granted the status of a so-called "traffic investor" as a by the treaty in 1991, as well as by investors of a so-called "tracker."
It is authorized to mine in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The investor-distaged area is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is rugged, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"It can be mined on an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
The division's Macedonian Rober Sandev is bringing to the demonstration one such concession.
It is reminiscent of a small potato, or, in a little imagination, the fabled shenigoer who, according to legend, revived the Golem.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
Big words are not lacking in the WestLB board's letter to the employees of this bank.
The merger of this Düsseldorf money institution with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank will create "central institutions of the financial group of savings banks for the capital markets trade," we will read in a letter that became public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will bring a "set of competencies" providing long-term returns into this transaction.
And, he said, such a merger could be a decisive impetus for further association in the provincial bank sector.
Such texts are made when the board wants to demonstrate the ability to act in a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Office for the Supervision of Financial Services, whose communication to the North Rhine-Westphalia Provincial Government that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
However, the connection between Deka-Bank, which the savings bank customers know about for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever its kind, has been talked about for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
The head of the Deka-Bank, Franz Waas, heard in the presentation of his six-month results at the end of August that he failed to see the merger of his banking house from Mainzer Landstraße with one of the country's banks, such as Helaba Bank or WestLB, he did not see the point.
However, the board of directors of Deka-Bank, which is backed by one half of the Land Bank and the other by the Savings Bank, has put the board of directors in line with WestLB in charge of conducting talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could involve trading in the capital market or part of it.
However, the talks have only just begun, the financiers point out.
Deka-Bank, which is one of the more important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt with its 3,000 employees, is not being discussed for the first time in the context of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it looked as if Deka-Bank's merger with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba Bank.
This tri-party was nothing after all.
Shortly after the merger plans became public, the Hessen provincial government spoke out against the participation of Helaba Bank.
The two remaining banking houses did not come together.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was acquired instead by the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg of Stuttgart.
Despite this, there has been repeated speculation about the merger of Deka-Bank with the Landesbanks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, the chairman of Helaba Bank's board of directors, commented negatively about the merger of his financial home with others.
However, it seems to be in the clear of the belief that the convergence of the various banking houses of the public sector is a must.
Now, after the elections to the provincial assembly in Bavaria, BayernLB's merger with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could begin to emerge.
That's not good news for Helaba.
Should the pressure for further mergers increase, it is gradually losing potential partners for such a merger.
In the south, it would play only second fiddle despite the fact that it has faced a financial crisis significantly better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The link with WestLB, for its part, was banned earlier in the year by the Sporters' Banks' Hessen-Thüringen Union, which has an 85% stake in Helaba.
This would make it possible at most Nord LB.
But geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one party to the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much the business models of the individual institutions are tuning in.
In June, Merl said that the decisive issue of the business model should be ensured by the future competitiveness of the Landesbanks, the German Association of Savings Banks and the Service Banks has not yet answered.
Everything could also end in the distribution of WestLB, which, of course, no one in this institution wants.
That is why a letter from the local board of directors to try to make a "complex solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to combine it with the connection of the individual components with Deka-Bank will tell time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the 'weekend with Italians'
It's the first time for Elena, for Luca for the third or fourth.
But this time Elena will be there as his girlfriend, and so things will be different, she says.
Behind them, at the five-litre Kaiser barrel, there is a more holied bearded man and two hundred tourists on Oktoberfest demonstrate how deep tones he can pass on his throat.
Elena Luca scribbles first and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova Station, there will be four buses with the designation "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra" at 23.45 this evening, estimated to arrive 6.30.
Three buses are mainly occupied by Italians, with exclusively Brazilians riding on one bus.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, having already celebrated at night.
And out loud, says Marco Guarda, that's not for the Italians.
Marc, who is wearing a long coat with a fume imitation lining and glasses with wide silver rims, the three buses are on board.
He has been riding with them on Oktoberfest for five years, hosting three expeditions this year alone.
At night there, during the day between the beer stalls, at 10:30 p.m. to leave back.
Overnight would mean only unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcome toast to the Kaiser beer, brewed exactly under the Bavarian Law on the Purity of Beer, Health Insurance and the German-speaking guide - Marco went to a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses go out into the night, on the autostrada in the direction of "Brennero".
Beer is not served, no yet.
The bus quickly silences, passengers sleep.
They do well, they'll need their strength.
It is being stopped in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where many more buses with Italian license plates are taking one more break on the number 8 motorway just before Munich.
When Marc's group finally arrives at a parking lot near Theresienewiese at 6:30 a.m. as scheduled, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are being collected, Marco has a final speech, explains the plan of the attack.
One: Put on a yellow cap.
On it, on the left, is "Oktoberfest" written, next to the internet address of Marc's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Two: "When the door to the beer tent opens, run!" Marco calls into the morning air.
"Go!" Go and sit in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, so that you don't get in the way, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, place in space!"
The maza costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tip.
"Let's show the Secrets that we're behaving.
Once you've left your seats, they're gone!'
Three: "Tonight at 10:30 p.m. be here again!" You understand?
And up to Wiesn, a space with the beer tents.
Along the way, one member of the group hangs yellow caps like tree markers, signs and even an election poster of a large Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for the retreat.
As a "weekend with the Italians" is known for the second weekend of Oktoberfest.
Accurate figures on the numbers of visitors are not available; they are talking about the fifty thousand of those making their way through the Alps and invading beer tents, ten per cent of all visitors are said to have arrived from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police line will be reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which is conducting a national statistic in which Italians take first place in front of the British (about 60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments.
It is the Hofbräu tent especially popular with the Italians.
Sagpless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
As recently as last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system was relatively stable.
Good that this politician used the word "relatively" and the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared spared the crisis.
For that one this weekend has come to us.
The Dax index-professional financial house specializing in real estate financing Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive a loan from a consortium of German banks to protect against turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the credit assistance in question would go up to 35 billion euros.
The interest will only have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) on the actual amount.
The money is said to come from both private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
This state financier, according to a newspaper report, has been extremely timely in the short term refinancing for the long-term projects for which he lent money, which is no longer possible now due to a distrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve shrunk by 95% to €2.37 million, and the equity ratio of the equity ratio was slightly reduced from 1.45 percent.
Current revenues and net revenues from financial business fell to zero compared to last year, revenues from the increased value of receivables and certain securities, as well as the cancellation of credit trading reserves, fell by more than 70 percent to €5 million.
It is only thanks to the higher refunds for the subsequent settlement costs in the restructuring of the former Depfa group and the reimbursement of interest under the Tax Code and for the brokering of the trade for the group businesses that the 16% decrease on the revenue side was still moderate.
After his privatisation in 1990, the former state financier was burned on mortgages for sole traders, which were then set aside from the portfolio of services and further led by Aareal Bank.
Because it was earning too little in classic state funding, Depfa was then more heavily involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects by private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate must now write something off the value of its subsidiary, and these depreciations will have a "cruel material effect" on the calculation of the entire group's profit and losses, as some have become vaguely heard.
The fact is, there will be no dividend.
It has already been cut back by two-thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier for state and infrastructure projects since the takeover of the Defa.
More strongly than other institutes, it depends on refinancing in the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, a spring of interbank loans virtually dried up two weeks ago as banks guard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds a year for part of the Depfa loan portfolio - around 50 billion euros.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the financial need of the group is covered by this loan for the foreseeable future and the company is protected "behinds the influence of international money markets at the moment to a large extent of incompetent functionality."
Other sources have been told that this money has secured refinancing by the end of 2009.
HRE's chairman, on the other hand, said that Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for the Supervision of Financial Services (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate group on the market is now assured.
This is what the bank's shareholders and creditors hope.
But given the dynamism and elusiveness of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely impossible that the loan would not need to be completely exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank appears to have faced insolvency late Sunday afternoon, it cannot, if a preliminary, be able to soothe the passion, even a preliminary one.
The share price plummeted 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, bond rates were well held.
While preferential debt has barely moved, secondary bonds rates are being lost more strongly.
This is particularly the case for the bonds of the former subsidiary firm Württemberg Hypo and, logically, the bonds with a maturity after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate's ties originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability, after a significant sharpening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which brought it to the company by taking over the Defer, must be understood as a result of the stability of the international financial system.
As long as emission banks, governments and less less affected commercial banks are willing to support the scheme, it is possible to count on the reimbursement of securities within their due period.
But it may also happen that almost no one is hopeful of at the moment - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports coming at the same time as this partial nationalized, the probability bordering on certainty has now become mere legitimate hope.
This, especially to long-term creditors, is likely to be prepared for a series of sleepless nights, when they will decide whether to give up their commitments.
Short-curday investors may use the cut-off line to at least create a loss transfer from previous accounting periods to later-year exchange rate earnings for the purpose of the future payment of the capital income tax.
German special deployment units were in the freeing of the hostages
The Egyptian government has asked for help from Germany in dealing with the hostage crisis - the experts arrived.
When the situation escalated, the special forces were ready, but there was no deployment.
Gradually, further details of the circumstances surrounding the liberation of eleven hijacked European tourists are becoming public.
According to the Ministry of Defence and Interior, the rescue effort was indirectly involved in the rescue effort.
According to the ministries, both Federal Army experts and the German Police Counter Terrorism Group, the Federal Police Squadron, the Federal Police Squadron, the Federal Criminal Office, as well as the Logistics Experts from the Technical Assistance Services (Technisches Hilfswerk) were on the spot.
However, according to another statement from the spokesmen of both ministries on Monday afternoon, however, there was no need for the German forces because the kidnappers let their prisoners go and fled when they recognized the signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government is said to have accepted the aid offered by Germany as a support force for action on the ground.
"Fortunately, that did not happen," one spokesman for the Federal Interior Ministry said.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers made up of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, as well as eight of their Egyptian guides on 19 September in the south of Egypt.
After being kidnapped in a desert region in the south of Egypt, hostages were moved in the border territories between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hijackers remained unclear to the last moment, as well as details of the acquittal or possible payment of the ransom.
At the moment, the rescued ones are fine in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said the release of the hostages was in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of his release.
There is no information available in Berlin as to when the rescues will return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, all five tourists should, even with special forces, leave with special forces for the German Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secret of the box bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is to present herself on her first day at a high school in Tachibana, the girls start to sniff themselves: the German is a complete "kawaii"!
What's that mean?
Sylvana has known this word from mangas. On his new exchange blog, he talks about Japan.
"The first day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
Already out of my way to school, I was scared.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take the train to the middle in Tachibana for 40 minutes.
I had to find the trip myself, luckily I didn't get lost.
The start of the teaching on Tachibana does not seem to be given as strictly as it is in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students start meeting after eight o'clock and twenty minutes before the ninth, a short sit-down with the teacher, the so-called 'home room' begins.
But before the classroom started, I should have introduced myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, let alone in front of the class of 40 students.
Having not yet had a school uniform, I wore an old skirt of my host's mom, a blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So dressed like this, I stood in front of the bench and tried to say it all correctly: 'Sajonara Wo She Sely Sylvana' - - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and it's my birthday in a week's time.
At that point, I was so glad that I started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were rumored, giggling and waving, and I could still hear the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my mangles.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls required for survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly entered my place.
The girl next to me smiled broadly, considering it an honor that a foreign student should have been sitting next to her.
The rest of the class was relatively calm, but when the gong came, it literally baked me.
They spoke in the other and giggled and asked me about the possible and the impossible - and yet it is really hard to understand Japanese English.
Then, at the break, they all unpacked their benta.
My host mum made me a lunchbox for me, too - and that's different from boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, cucumber and algae salad, fruit and a kind of fish in the tofu batter.
I usually have no idea what exactly I'm eating here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
What's certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except for the salt-laden plums, br!
Benta at Japanese schools is not just a lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a handmade bento, which in this case is particularly artistically groomed, and hopes to get to know the boy at a snack at a break.
I read about that in my manga comics.
I wonder if I'll see this here, too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said:
'Cause she just fascinates me."
After all, I've been prefers to read mangoes for years.
And to get better understanding of these comic books and their culture, I started to learn a little Japanese one day.
So it was very clear to me that I would have to come here one day.
Because I also have a thing for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other it is rigorous, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here before, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen.'
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Package
The first chamber of the US Congress let the $700 billion rescue package for financial markets fall by a narrow majority.
The Dow Jones fell sharply.
By a margin of 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's financial market bailout package.
Despite all the calls from US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both parties did not find a majority for a program that should ease the chaos in financial markets.
The dramatic action was desperately sought to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, called on the MP to give his consent before the vote, though, as he put it, the plan is not popular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened at all," he acknowledged.
Even during the vote, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
This was due to investors' fears that the state rescue package could be forfeited.
Shortly before the vote, the index was raised to fall steeply after the announcement of the shipwreck.
Experts are now counting on more serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order to enter into force, the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is needed.
Even rats have feelings
When a rat or a cockroach runs from danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
But how could it be to verify whether they feel the same thing when they behave in the same way as we do?
The online magazine "Edge" has been published for several years by posts by well-known scientists.
In its series, SPIEGEL ONLINE presents the selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without you being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it when we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, once we start to address another kind and open up questions of perception or general consciousness, we enter the impassable terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat gets into danger, he will do the same thing as many other animals: he will pretend to be dead, fleeing, or attack.
People behave in the same way, of which some scientists conclude on comparable subjective experiences.
I don't believe in that, however.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to experiencing animals.
This is both because circuits associated with human consciousness almost always involve the side-fencing prefrontal cortex (for its share of short-term memory and performance or management functions).
This vast area is significantly more developed in humans than in other primates, and other creatures seem to be completely absent from other creatures.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them the knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and make decisions, there is a reason to believe that one is even different from other primates.
Another dramatic oddity could be concealed by a man's linguistic nature: because such a large part of his perception is linked to language, it is often said that consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could exclude the animals.
But even if the language's consciousness didn't matter, it would surely be influenced by the language, so that the animal consciousness, however constructed, would probably be distinguished from most of our consciousness states.
It is therefore difficult to see what the consciousness of other animals may look like.
When, as something indoor and subjective, it is neither measured nor, for the sake of special hardware, analysed on the basis of our own experience, it sets us up to great problems by exploring it.
Most of my outlets relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to examine the processes in the consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what is happening in the short-term memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualisation.
But this approach, addressed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses more on the neural correlates of consciousness than causal mechanisms: both may be identical, but they may not be.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of a non-flare retentioning chartrex for the realisation of visualisation.
What does this mean for feelings?
I deduce them from the fact that an emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in the brain conscious of its own activity.
What we refer to as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system of the localized brain (or its consequences, such as bodily reactions) uses the operating memory.
Viewed from this angle, the feelings are closely intertwined with those kortexic regions that characterize primates, and especially humans.
In the connection with linguistic nature, a subtle graduation of perception arises, because by means of words and grammar, we can distinguish and categorise the states in order to add them to others side by side.
By contrast, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the cortex and brain stem areas dedicated to physical feelings, like Jaak Pankseep, which, however, is more focused on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during the course of human evolution, it could well participate in the feelings perceived by multiple animal houses.
In theory, I cannot oppose it, but I find this unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what seems to us to be fear in rats and people is probably felt by both organisms in the same way: But how is it possible to verify, says Pankseep, whether rats and people feel the same thing when they behave in the same way?
The cockroach flees the danger - does he feel fear, too?
From my point of view, the mere similarity of the behaviour cannot prove the maturity of experiencing.
It is true that a neural comparison moves us on: rats and humans have similar cerebral tribes, while cockroaches or the brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for the feelings?
And even if it were possible to prove it in a person: how would we prove it with rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who do you?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to do it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from our feelings (because human consciousness rests on special circuits and on the tongue), I prefer to examine emotional behavior rather than the emotional perception of rats.
In any case, we may see progress at the neural level if we measure the same for rats and humans.
Just as I don't explore the language and consciousness in the rat, I don't even examine feelings, I don't know if they exist.
It is possible to think it is short-sighted, but I move forward rather than rushing repeatedly against the wall.
I'm a practical emotional person.
UEFA President Platini: Sleeping Same for Poland and Ukraine
Acting Prime Minister Ivan Vasyunyk said preparations would soon be run directly by the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to hold the European Championships together with Poland," said Vasyunyk.
"But it is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has only just started, and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the early fulfilment of the timetable for the construction or redevelopment of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts are lagging behind.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for the European Championship will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as quickly as possible," said the chairman of the Ukrainian union, Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep following us."
An even more radical move was agreed in Poland.
The management of the Polish PZPN union was dismissed by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawbloi.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport, Mirosław Drzewiecki.
He said there was "a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish press PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini by letter that this step will not suffer the preparation for the 2012 European Championships."
Several teams from the first league were doomed to a forced descent in the past season only due to manipulation, and in the end it had to be hastily moved the start of the league.
Travel agents record rising numbers of bookings
It looks like the winter will be good for German tourism entrepreneurs:
According to one study, the turnover for the booking of the next month trips has grown significantly compared to the previous year - by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic growth, the Germans' appetite for travel is unlucky.
For bookings for the winter season, travel agents recorded a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the same period last year, as the German Travel Association (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) said in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK market survey, increased bookkeeping numbers are already available for the autumn months.
The turnaround was thus about eleven percent higher for October compared to 2007.
The basis for these results are the figures of the GfK, which annually evaluates booking data from the 1,200 German travel agents and interpolates them to the overall market.
Included in this result were bookings of the tours, which took place until the end of August 2008.
The weak dollar exchange rate is mainly in demand for trips to the US, DRV said.
For these trips, the addition of reservations makes about one-third.
In addition, the Germans are particularly desirable targets for Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters.
The organised tours are on course, said DRV chairman Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising expenditure of energy and food, the cost is "as a matter of it easier to calculate for the client than for an individually organised holiday."
Laepple explained that money can be saved by consumers, among other things, by using discounts for early booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of bookings was said to be very good, so a higher turnover will be recorded again compared to the previous year - although according to another study the number of Germans who made some travel has decreased compared to the previous year.
Outraged Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to advertise a new film, she talked about private things in an interview - and now she's in trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan referred to her former Dennis Quaid as a matrimizor marriage.
He's furious and strikes back.
The belated Rose War of the Redessept of the former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors are in a messy feud - in the public eye.
In an interview with the American magazine InStyle, Meg Ryan commented for the first time on the reasons for the collapse of her marriage: "The rations were unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She said she only learned of the scale of the fraud after the divorce.
The impetus for this mental striptease was Ryan's PR's work for her new film, "The Women," which tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's response to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was distinctive: It's "crazy," the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News that "Meg repeatedly chews down the history of our relationship and edits it."
Moreover, it is "political" that the joint 16-year-old son of Jack once again "is publicly commemorates the pain and radical changes that divorce for every child."
While Ryan has lived alone since her divorce, Quaid is married again and recently became the father of the twins.
He concludes his reflections on the slap: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider it a happy one to have an amazing family that is doing great."
Fare and hotel prices fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than the year before.
In Germany, according to one current study, flights were even cheaper by as much as 50 percent.
Flights and accommodation in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its data on the bookings made from the first half of 2008 and found a significant drop in the second quarter after the rise in prices in the first quarter.
After prices on the hotel market grew for several years, accommodation in many places has already become cheaper.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed still grew by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, prices were already 3.6 percent lower from April to June than in the previous year.
This trend was most pathetic in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
American Express considers the reason for this trend to be the weak dollar rate, which has caused the "decreasing appetite for American tourists to travel."
The drop in hotel prices was also more heavily affected by financial centres than industrial centres, such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices, with their growth of 26.3 percent, even set a European record.
Ticket prices also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
To increase kerosene, passengers in the Economy class had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, with fuel-intensive long-haul flights even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, fares in the Economy class fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but the changes were noticeably less pronounced in the Business and First-Class classes.
In Germany, prices plummeted even more sharply than in other European countries:
They grew 11.9 percent from January to March, down 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
On German domestic flights, according to the cited study, prices fell by half.
One of the reasons for this price crash is slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is increased competitive pressure because of the Open Skies agreement, which has liberalised air traffic between the US and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of unprofitable routes by air carriers, as well as the high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone it was 24 airlines.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1-0
With one goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV is getting to the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay is no longer able to assemble a functioning eleven.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - to enlarge the failed landing for Representative Marko Marwin.
This player from Gladbach did not participate in the game until late and failed topped with a balloon on the pole.
His report was precise, formulated, and was convincingly from his mouth.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," hissed Hermann Rieger in the corridor to the booths of the Hamburg arena.
There wasn't much going on in the catacombs, the break between the halftime ended and most people were back to sitting in their seats.
Rieger has been a MAV physiotherapist for nearly three decades and enjoys more respect than many of the momentary actor.
And so his plea was also answered in the responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and gave up his thumb as a sign of a match.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His orders were probably the same: with the second goal!
The execution did not take place.
"It didn't look at everything here today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt, too, would have been "wanted more relaxed."
The Hamburg Hamburgen's header owes a 1-0 vote for Mladen Petrić (11th) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladbazans could not have harmed the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summarized.
The Hamburger SV will celebrate 121 years of its existence this Monday.
Viewers thus celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue skies above the arena and a live updated table on a video wall in which their team was listed as the premier.
It'll be a birthday without a big party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the interim table result symbolizes the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petrić and FC Bayern, won't be easy - is slow to be shining, but he's not able to shine yet.
"We need more feeling and more dribbling," Jol said emphatically.
My First Oktoberfest
The endlessly repeated ash, a drowd beer and prominent in costumes from well-known designers.
First time in a beer meadow.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, a TV presenter, and she wears a tailored costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is secondhandled.
But one thing brings us together: we're not even three minutes in a beer meadow, and we're already being pounced by photographers and swiftly filling up with memory cards - I'm flattered, for the first time at Oktoberfest.
This is how you can make friends.
It seems my cheap costume has served its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equator, and so my feeling of comfort in costume was rather limited.
But as soon as he arrived at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone is wearing women's costumes or leather trousers; no one is looking at disgusted or embarrassingly offended - everything is completely normal.
Strange views at the chocolate-covered banana stall are only my apron.
One of the Munichs points out to me that I have given it to the wrong losing: "You are free, in the middle of a virgin, entered on the right, widowed at the back."
Sharing, I'll throw the bow from the back to the left.
"All right," he says, and laughs.
Others don't worry so much about the sublime flirtation techniques, and they're wearing simple felt hats that read "To drunk to get dressed!" and stick out the bystanders naked buttocks.
A young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is called Bob, he's from England, and he came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds "gorgeous," with an extended "óo."
This is what he tells me after relieving himself of a drunk wimmade.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks are garbage bins.
Bob is therefore one of the dreaded "Wildbieslers," as it is called in public in public to free urinate people in Bavaria.
The others have no happiness to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around the eighth night, they run around the area where Oktoberfest takes place, in droves of medics who have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Paramedics always appear in flocks - in four, they wear a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
They work like most of the beer-goadow's visitors: empty there, full back again.
Who lies under the tarp of this coffin of the pardon is not visible.
"That so te that can't go on," one of the medics calls me in response to my question and disappears into the crowd.
After the defeat in the vote
There's fear on Wall Street.
Initial reports of the sinking of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to drop by as much as 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss in one day in its history.
Later, Dow gained some weight.
Around 8:30 p.m., this world's most important stock market barometer showed a 5 percent drop to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was at 1548 points at more than seven percent in the negative.
The worst performer was in Dow at the moment American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
None of the titles could be strengthened.
Shares in Goldman Sachs lost nearly 10 percent.
Just a few days earlier, the big investor Warren Buffett had a stake in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called rotten mortgage papers.
However, the entire amount is not to be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the state is to receive the stock option certificates of financial firms, which could be reimbursed in the favourable exchange rate development, thus reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock odds in Europe are falling so much
Billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US does not deprive investors of the doubt.
The sharecrope of the large German bank, Hypo Real Estate, is heavily downgraded and is withdrawing the Dax index.
The US Dow Jones is losing out despite a planned state bailout.
The Spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have plucked the German akci at far ground.
Shares in the aforementioned Munich real estate financier lost up to three-quarters of its value despite a rescue by the federal government and private banks, with Commerzbank losing more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important 6000 points mark and scored 5,839 points with a minus of 3.7 percent.
Worldwide, stock markets went to their knees.
In New York, a business day on Wall Street began with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion rescue package would not have to be enough to revive events in the financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in its first trading hour, making it at 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the bailout plan, the Senate could turn out to vote 1. October.
Other European stock exchanges were only one way: in London, the FTSE initially weakened by 3.2 percent, with CAC-40 losing 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, Japan's leading index, the Nikkei, fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 units after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent, and trading ended at 12,595.75.
In MDAx, shares in Arcandor lost their share capital after the announcement.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourist concern also announced that it would not sell the shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have been unaware of fares with one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of the space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativity might not be quite right.
For nearly 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
The fuel lines, which will soon freeze, they now face the death of the winter.
For years, one mysterious phenomenon has been a matter of mess - the anomaly of the gravity slingshot.
The gravitational gungry is a aerial maneuver of space probes, in which they acquire additional momentum in the gravitational field of some space body, such as Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
But what the scientist has been saying for years in this case in astonishment: the flying bodies are not acting as one would expect, according to the good old-fashioned law of gravity.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
Probes unexpectedly accelerate or slow down.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
He was baptized by the anomalies of the gravity slingshot.
Several experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of relativity by Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter by curating the space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler, of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, remains convinced that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the anomaly of the gravitational workmanege using the so-called dark matter, the presence of which was discovered in the universe by astronomers.
"Associated for this anomaly, dark matter could be that could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space for as a decade.
It is based on an obviously gravitational force, the effect of which on other space bodies can be observed.
She herself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, which means that it does not broadcast or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, just or visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, a fifth of the total masses of the universe are good from this dark matter.
In Egypt, kidnapped tourists are at large
After ten days in the hands of their hijackers, according to a statement by the Italian Foreign Minister in Egypt, the kidnapped tourists are back to freedom.
The kidnappers of Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
In the shootout before the release, they say six hijackers were killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
The Germans have repeatedly become targets of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists being introduced to the Sahara seem to be free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabiya and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports by Italian Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been freed.
We are now verifying their health," Frattini said.
According to a report by Egyptian state television, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are well and safe.
All 19 participants in the expedition to the desert are already expected to be on their way to Cairo.
The backdrop to the shootout in the release of the hostages remains unclear: according to the Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese military surprisingly killed the six hijackers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the ransom," the quoted worker said.
He said, "it was just a matter of taking the hostage's hold on," when "this surprise" came suddenly.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers in a border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday, and two of them were captured.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing one of the German intermediaries, that the release of the hostages was being delayed because the kidnappers were worried about their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Police release name of accident victim
The name of a 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a car in Essex was released.
An accident at Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon affected Carole Paulson of the Chelmsford Road there.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was detained on suspicion of reckless driving.
He's already been released on police bail.
Abuse by stepfather "left to suicide"
The several years of abuse by the stepfather led the woman to kill herself, he said in court.
After confessing to eight sexual harassment cases, 57-year-old Michael Trerise of Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court at Truro heard that he had tied his step-de-clad father Stephanie Randle regularly when she was between the age of five and seven.
"I feel responsible for her death," Treris wrote in a confession.
The court also told that Ms. Randle was killed at her home in the Mutley in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and tied her up to her eyes and subsequently sexually abused her while her mother worked in the pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, it was said before the court that Miss Randle, who spent a substantial part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust, was persecuted by the spectre of abuse that had been committed to her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife said in court that in 2006 they called friends of Miss Randle, who was also very much involved in surfing and cycling, that she was "emotionally dead" and that she "did her life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her flat in Plymouth.
She is believed to have suffocated with a plastic bag.
Randle faced the stepfather of his daughter, who wrote the confession ending with the words: "I binded her and binded her eyes.
"I didn't use it.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Treris, "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been awful for your sacrifice when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking her own life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she had not done so, the matter would probably not have reached the court at all."
"I would particularly like to highlight the consequences that Stephani's parents say your crime has had on their daughter over the years," he added.
"Simply otherwise, she would probably be a promising, successful, and happy young woman."
The official who lost the data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top-secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top-secret documents on the train to Waterloo while he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents were in the hands of the BBC before they were handed to the police.
It is the least serious offense against the aforementioned law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
The BBC's letterter's defense affairs correspondent, Frank Gardner, said that such a move would be surprising to many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the Ministry and the Cabinet Office," he said.
A staff member who may not be appointed is charged under Section 8.1 of the Act in question, a term that deals with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended the Metropolitan Police indict the official on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he had forgotten contained secret analyses of Al Qaeda and the possibilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown location.
Cooperative with credit unions facing B&B debt
British co-league creditors may have to settle out of more than £80m of debt after the closure of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The government has provided £14 billion to deposit protection for the deposits of 2.6 million clients at Bradford & Bingley.
The interest of this loan will be repaid by all firms taking client deposits, including 59 credit unions.
The CEO of the Association of Credit Banks of Credits (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "affecting" that the creditors and their members must pay.
The $1800 debt will eventually be paid for by the rescued Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest rate that is accumulated in the meantime will be repaid every year by all 700 financial firms that take client deposits.
The BBC's cash service compensation plan has confirmed that all 59 credit unions are included in this issue.
It is humbling that these institutions that behaved judiciously... must now pay off some of the accounts of those institutions that were not nearly so considerate
Adrian Coles, BA
He said that each firm should pay proportionally to the deposits it held, and that the backers were to pay about 18% of the price.
The Treasury estimates that the debt's interest will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that the credit unions will have to find £81 million to repay interest from the first year.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Co-Banking Trade Association, told the BBC that he was convinced that this was not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that behaved judiciously during the boom in the housing market now have to repay some of the accounts of those institutions that were far from prudent."
According to the BSA, no credit union has fallen since they appeared in 1945.
"We will have to examine all aspects of this in the next few weeks to see what the options are to protect the credit union and their members from the account that might be relevant," Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of this September to the end of March this year.
In 2010, there will be interest for the whole year to be repaid, and that could be almost twice as much.
As credit unmaunched aggregates are creditors, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates in their accounts.
Turkish diplomatic horizons expand
Long before Turkey began to seek to join the European Union, European powers longed to penetrate deep into the Turkish bounds.
On the east bank of the Bosphorus, perhaps only twenty paces in Asia, one of the best monuments of this unsuccessful imperial ambition stands.
Hydarpaša railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Con in the Neo-Renaissance style.
So you'll be told by the tour guides.
The building sits astride at the end of the platforms with a tower on each corner of the front, at a glance indistinct notable from some provincial German town hall.
Stone is dirty.
The whole structure is slowly falling apart.
But once you got inside the vaulted cash register, you could no longer have a doubt about the size of the business of which the station's westernmost gateway was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium of Anatolian-Baffad Corporation.
Germany, which was involved in the game of empires late, intended to implement its ambitions to control the Middle East with the help of this railroad, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond the territory that is now Saudi Arabia.
But the German imperial ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen Cold War boundaries, is over
British and colonial forces advanced from Egypt, pushing the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And for Hydarpaša, the bad news came, too.
In 1917, the explosion of the ammunition train destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has gradually crumbled and history has bypassed it.
But today, this gateway to Anatolia and farther east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the widening horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
A new policy is now being applied - Turkey is engaged.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fars, with Iraq and Iran, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I mounted a night train to the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I was to meet one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish MEP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a bumpy ride on the tracks, which recalled the old-world rhythms of the well-known documentary Night's Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a shift in the paradigms of the Turkish consensus.
It aroused suspicion in the west, especially in Washington.
The cab brought me to the AKP's main tent, an ultra-modern stone and metal building, deliberately built on an developing suburb, surrounded by half-built store houses and power-shaped horswells, where medium-sized executives in business suits - both men and women - meet to make early morning shops.
Suat Kiniklioglu could well be a center-right politician from almost every other European political party.
Jack, a tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry, too.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey to its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he told me.
Turkey was cut off from its locks.
Today, they must look to the east and to the west at the same time.
It was no choice.
It must have done both.
"But surely the moment will come," I asked, "when will Turkey have to make a decision?"
"Turkey," he said, "it was not to be allowed to make such a decision."
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to was saying almost from memory: Turkish relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea, are as much to the benefit of Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, take these tracks east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpaša Station, after another mostly sleepless night, I was thinking of the two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Con, who watched the building built a century ago.
How they would be surprised if they found out that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be, in a substantial part, in Turkish hands.
And as I waited in the harbor for the ferry back through the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days, Turkey was called the 'sick man of Europe'.
So it seems that, at least then, there was little doubt about which continent would be entitled to this fascinating country.
Milk up by five pc/pp to a litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey Dairy announced that it would increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pc per litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after a biplane hike in February, and it comes after research conducted by a consultancy.
Retailers are to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect the hikes in customer prices.
Before the February increase, the Jersey wholesale milk price was last changed in 2002.
Bauka for Bangladeshi ex-PM rejected
A Bangladeshi court has rejected former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vajidova's request to be released on bail, which means that if she returns to her homeland, she may be arrested.
Her lawyers said the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the charge that she had been blackmailed by extracting over $50 million taka ($799,700) when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several allegations of corruption against it.
Khalid Ziyá, a longtime political rival to Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasín is to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her party, the People's League (Awami League), demanded that the local army-held government first give it its full freedom.
The letterters say that while she was fired on her word of honor to have a medical procedure abroad, it is not clear under the terms of her release whether she will remain at large when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal the High Court's order to the Supreme Court.
"The High Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail, saying he did not need bail when he was already undergoing examinations released abroad," her defense attorney, Rafique-ul Huq, said.
"We will appeal to the High Court order."
Her lawyers said she needed bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December election.
A senior People's League official said Sheikh Hasín should return home after the 17th. October.
She was detained last year after the military-held interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to allow medical treatment abroad.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaled Ziya both reject all the allegations against each other.
Fear of polio vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children did not take part in the recent blanket vaccination against armored armored for violence associated with the Taliban.
The UN last week conducted vaccinations in six provinces.
However, she says she could not have reached children in the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar for safety reasons.
A UN spokesman said that this had happened, despite the Taliban's promises, that it would not attack or prevent them from working for the thousands of vaccinatory workers.
BSkyB loses ITV litigation
BSkyB lost a court case to review the Commission's decision on the Competition Commission, which ordered the firm to reduce its stake in the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Board of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% below 7,5 %.
The Commission previously stated that BSkyB's share of the competition was undermined and gave the company a disproportionate influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in a deal in 2006 that prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Authority announced that the acquisition of a stake in ITV by BSkyB had given rise to doubt the independence of ITV and called on the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Virgin consortium chief Sir Richard Branson, consumer organisation and regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in its stake in ITV was unreasonable and disproportionate as a solution - primarily because BSkyB had previously said it was willing to give up its voting rights.
A New Investigation of the American Advocates Affair
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special plaintiff to examine the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The move came in a situation where the report on the affair drawn up by the Chief Justice Department inspector criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmaker and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by fears that the attorneys had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the interviewees interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators in order to obstruct justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said in the report: "The allegations, including the potential criminal conduct, have not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice stripped nine U.S. attorneys of their office in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry said the attorneys had been released because of their poor performances.
However, it was later revealed that the dismissed attorneys were no worse off than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the redundancies were motivated politically.
Some of the attorneys were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican deputies and senators, while others have refused to investigate the allegations of deception against the Democrats.
American attorneys are investigating and conducting lawsuits in court cases for the government.
They may be released at any time but shall not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, came under fire for the redundancies and eventually resigned.
A number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
The Inspector-General's report was very critical of Gonzales' role in the affair, saying he bore "the main responsibility" for the redundancies, that he had "abdated" from his leadership position and was "referably uncommitted about it."
Other officials, including former senior Bushov adviser Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's masterpiece will be awarded
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive one of the Q Awards for her epic anthem, Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will be coming to the ceremony in London for his special gold prize, said he was "honored" with the recognition.
The song, which lasts for nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year's nominees are led by Coldplay, which has been shortlisted in four categories.
Paul Rees, the chief editor of Q Magazine, said: "There are some songs that stand above such things as time and genre, and the Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed the big vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It began with an instrumental part that took nearly two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and reached the highest in 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album, Bat Out Of Hell, was listed for about nine years, and has been sold worldwide for more than forty million copies.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, and was operated on in 2003 for irregular heart rhythm after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
It was later revealed that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscure street, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other roads, some famous, some only utility.
But even many taxi-veteran-veteran and longtime locals have difficulty finding the Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of it.
This little alley is in the East Village district and leads north from First Street - without making it to Second Street - between the Bowers and Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and forty meters in length, it is more like a dusty passage than a traffic lane.
There are no signs with street names.
In a regular atlas, it's virtually invisible.
Nevertheless, the aisle has an admirer.
For example, Avalon Bay, the developer of the recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants to redesign Extra Place and create a cleaner passage to the shops and boutiques to be opened in the new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbours who say they were enchanted by the shortened alley simply because it was one of the last vestes from before the block was refined.
However, the city's Office for the Protection and Development of the Construction, which has the street in its hands, has no interest in sticking to it.
At a meeting of the Municipal Community Land Committee, representatives of the Municipal Authority and Avalon Bay outlined a plan to buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, the district manager of the Municipal Community 3, the committee favours the option for the streets to remain in the hands of the city and requested a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city already owns very few plots of land, and we would like Extra Place to stay in its possession," she said.
"Proposals for repairs and administration could be made, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wanted to redesign the small street and install seating seats, several of which would be used by a cafe, the interest of which the developer expects to rent the premises.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokeswoman, said that although the company wanted to use the street, he did not necessarily want to own it.
"The main intention of Avalon Bay is to fix this desolate aisle and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said, adding that the sale had been proposed by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation of the Construction Office, said the city had indeed wanted to sell the street, noting that the task of his office was to develop the property rather than to manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place, it has left a shallow footprint in history.
Some people think the street got its name in 1802 when the great farm of Philip Minthorn was divided among several of his children and no one made a claim to the narrow strip of land.
The back door of the CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, led to Extra Place, and the alley is perhaps best known as the backdrop of a photograph on the cover of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia."
"The place was amazing," says Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothing and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers who write about refining the East Village district, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place, claiming that the public piece of public property, however meager, should remain public.
Others see the Extra Place as a rarity - an almost unchanged piece of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog on behalf of Jeremiah's Falling New York (with the subtitle "The Book of Wailing: a bitterly nostalgic view of the city in the process of extinction"), posted part of the story of the Extra Place from the Speaking of the City section, which appeared in The New Yorker in the 1952 newspaper.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dead end, dark even in the daytime and enclosed by rusty iron doors of warehouses and hammered windows where a week-old newspaper runs through the grocery store."
With a few exceptions, the alley of the one-weekly one of the early days looked exactly the same.
The rat ran across the blind end of the street near the door that once led to the CBGB, where an expensive clothing store now stands.
There was a graffiti on the walls, and next to a fresh batch of dumped newspapers lay an empty beer bottle.
A few passers-by said they rarely thought at Extra Place, but suggested that a boost might come in handy.
In contrast, Fields said he thought some people underestimate the appearance of the alley in her present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "they were in places of dark and damp and disgusting."
Bilingvalita debate: immersion in English
In this edition of the section Focused on Education will be Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi to discuss the candidates' attitude to bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic in California and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of "Getter than you think: why the middle class needs to choose schools."
Effectively to appeal to Hilpan voters is a tricky business.
Barack Obama's educational agenda only proves this.
The Obama campaign observes that "Afro-American and Hispanic students are less likely to graduate than white pupils," which is true.
To combat such performance differences, Obama's educational agenda promotes, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for those who are just learning English.
The question for Barack Obama, however, is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Consider, for example, the Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in Los Angeles County East.
Pupils of this school are in the vast majority of cases Hispanic people from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are just learning English.
Even so, in the state's maths tests in 2008, an astonishing 100 per cent of fourth-grade pupils reached the highest level.
Almost the equally amazing ninety-three percent of fourth-grade pupils came to the highest level in state tests from the English language and literature.
This incredible success was achieved by a different method than that preferred by Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of skills and access without excuses.
Further, and this is what Obama should note, according to Linda Mikels, the director of Sixth Street, the school's teaching approach for those who are just learning English, is "full immersion."
The immersion in English emphasises the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Miss Mikels, who is against bilingual education, told me: "We had tremendous success with a brand-new student from Mexico - after twelve months, you'd walk into a class class and not know which one it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take the school as a role model for the school as a model, what should other schools with large shares of Hispanic and English-learning pupils look like?
The results the school is up to be made of course by the answer to this question, but the educational agenda of his own party (the National Education Association is a long-time supporter of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education is unclear to the premonition of Obama's answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should be taught in English, he recently trivialized the matter when he said that people should stop worrying about "only English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wishes to erase the performance gap, he should think carefully about educational patterns that work, rather than mock them and trivialize them.
Oil plummeting due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of fears that even a US plan to save the financial markets might not revive the economy.
Prices for term trades in oil fell in morning trading at the New York Commodity Exchange by as much as 7 per cent to $990 per barrel.
Since last Monday, prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial unrest on Wall Street, as well as a pair of powerful hurricals in the Gulf of Mexico.
Reaching a high of $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 a barrel this month earlier, with huge financial market uncertainties jumping up again.
The anxiety gripped investors again on Monday, even after the Congressional Bureau announced that it had reached an agreement over the weekend on the biggest rescue plan in history.
This report was overshadowed by the fresh fears that the financial crisis was far from the end.
In the latest episode of the advancing decomposition, the government announced that Citigroup would buy a banking section of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourgian governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the frantic weekend negotiations that led to an economic rescue plan "failure to reiterate the market feel incapable of reviving the mood in the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to fall.
"The outlook for global stock markets, interest rates and exchange rates has become severely insecure," the Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe that the commodities will not be able to escape the disease.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is the extent to which the American virus will spread worldwide, and especially to China."
The bank's analysts have cut their expectations for next year as oil consumption fell due to slower growth in the economy, and lowered their petrol price forecasts for about 20%.
Wild rider run in the second quarter broke the team's record
After spending more on the Jets in the last eight seasons than anyone else, defenseman Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
Then, on Sunday, he watched the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned a scoreless game into a spanking run.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals equalled their tortured game to the glimpses above each other.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent out Laveranues to a 12-yard touchdown sprint, heraping the afternoon, heres in which their progressive collaborations moved miles ahead.
Favre sent out the Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, including the one in which the cornerback fell, and the next 10 seconds before the halfway point of the game.
"It wasn't extraordinary," Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
"He's a hell of a good player.
We've been very good at communicating, whatever people think."
While Favre and Coles were in the toss, the defense attacked the quarterback Card Kureinals Warner.
Cornerback Darell Revis caught a stray throw and returned it to a 32-yard punkdown.
Safety Eric Smith scooped up another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner into fumbles.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that bows forced, was perhaps the best ever.
The Cardinals reached the ball 10 seconds into the game, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal to take a 34-0 lead.
That's the most Jets have ever gained in one quarter.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, when he was asked to describe the madness, said, "A second quarter or third quarter?"
When he was told that both-Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without an answer - Mangini said: 'I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter a lot more than the third.
It scored many points in a short space of time."
Returned Gebreselassie improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best long-distance runner ever, when he broke his own world record in the Berlin marathon on Sunday and became the first person to run a 26.2-mile-long race in under two hours and four minutes.
With a victory on a pleasantly flat track at 2:03:59 to 2:03:59, he rolled by 27 seconds his previous time of 2:04:26, which he ran in Berlin last year.
Gebreselassie, who is 35, set the 26th world record for his career, which is truly incredibly wide - breaking the world record or at least being a world champion at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie skipped the Olympic marathon in Beijing because he was - in retrospect, perhaps too alarmed - that the polluted air would irritate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunshine and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - Gebreselassie won on Sunday with a lightning-chunk average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As far as the track runners like the Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have focused on longer runs, the marathon record has dropped by more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebressassie told reporters that he had cramps in his calf and missed a week of practice two weeks ago.
The break was clearly more aroused than delay.
"I'm so happy," Gebresselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I was a little bit in doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized - mainly in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - for the fact that he was said to be over-plan planning his races, generally avoiding the world's marathon leaders, relying on conductors as if it were a track race, and set world records above the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's huge running qualities.
Maintained at a pace of four Kenya, Gebreselassie reached the half of the half.
After the conductors dropped out, Gebreselassie was constantly chased by two elite Khenka runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
A little earlier than three miles from the goal Gebreselassie took his last time and ran away from Kwambai, who then ran in second place at 2:05:36 to improve his personal best by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, the only quickest time in history 2:19:19 was completed in the excellent year of history 2:19: Irina Mikitěnko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a citizen of Germany.
The record time of 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliff of the UK.
The 36-year-old Mikitěnko surprisingly won the London Marathon at 2:24:14 last spring.
She missed the Beijing Games because of what was described as a back injury but recovered and won in Berlin and improved her personal best by almost five minutes in the third marathon she ever ran.
She ran the race cleverly and deliberately: she let the four Ethiopian and Kenyan cross-country skis get away with a big lead, and then drew them after about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia came second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop of Kenya finished third in a time 2:25:01.
Pride and obstacles to the life of blacks in a separate city
Hidden among the scattered amusement parks of the larger Orlando, a few miles from all shining, loud and huge, lies a quiet city in which the pride and difficulty of African-American life is alive.
Eatonville, the first completely black city to be incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquettas, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, getting a quay, two schools and none of any prisons."
Now it's a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eyonville Zora! festival to pay tribute to the Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains a sidelined even though she made it a tourist stop by including him in a Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers's economic crisis-era tourist guide.
It is still as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that country blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man who "didn't know so little about us that he doesn't even know what he's missing."
Even today, in a year when the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on races, many of the residents here remain cautious about the views of strangers.
"We pay close attention to how our story is told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the city's oldest parish.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and exertion.
It is both a historical model of the black rise and the community of nearly 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a center of literature, but also an oak-shaded example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - that arose from American slavery.
It is not too surprising that the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the Eatonville's concern for the idea of Eatonville really did begin with Zora, which is the only way Hurston is called here.
She presented her hometown to the world through heartfelt books full of dialect as "Mules and Men (Muly a men)" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida tourist guide changed the city a short distance to Route No. 17, which runs through the often-extended center of Florida, in the stage of black history and human drama.
With the vigour of a big drum in life and in literature, Hurston led the reader to the store of the first Esan in Mayor of Edmonton, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more personal places.
"From the left, next to the road," she wrote, "the white brown-decorated modern national school is decorated with well-maintained backyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller always takes care of, even if he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned the widow's new husband, Dash, and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything that fits into a one-hour hotel."
So, in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, resuscitation of marriages and sex.
This was obviously not the typical publisher of Fodor's.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it the way it was," says ninety-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnshots girls' glee club, who made Hurston immortal in quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a chipper-eater eccentric, which she often returned after her family moved to Florida's Jacksonville.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin remembers that for the most part, when she rushed into town, she arrived unannounced in the huge Chevrolet, smoking and wearing trousers in the city, which is still proud of her dignified dress.
Most of the residents were fascinated, Franklin said, but many were sneering.
"People have always been happy to see Zor," said Franklin.
But, he added, he rocked the chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely christened, "never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were removed from the press.
Eatonville, along with the rest of the world, seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no major mourners in Eatonville, or major public readings.
"I don't think they understood its significance for the world or its legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, the author of the biography of Hurston "Wrapped in Rainbows" published in 2003.
The change came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to use the city to stretch the city's five-lane highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local two-lane main road.
Orlando's sprawl had already pushed through Interstate No. 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still coming out of a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the struggle to mix races brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
'At that time, a bunch of white boys, they came in and threw oranges and things at the people who were on the side,' Franklin said.
"Actually, we had a lady killed here.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, and on his decision in the Brown case against the Education Chamber, she said she was "an insulting to my race rather than celebrating."
Residents now claim that the desegregation of schools, although positive in some areas, reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the local youth.
"The Blacksmith's children were used to huging - I remember - you hugged your teacher this morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and executive director of the nonprofit group Preserve the Eatonville Community (Save the Eatonville Community).
This lasted until the teachers and the pupils came from the same place, she added.
"You're not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean, there's a cultural barrier," said Miss Nathiri.
Nevertheless, civil rights have helped create a space for many more of Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who, like, she rose above the prejudices with reckless self-confidence and quotes such as "How can anyone deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker traveled to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight to revive her reputation.
Five years later, he came to the bookseller's shelf-told hostile Hurston's biography by Robert E. Hemenway, who re-established her in the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as Eatonville's most famous daughter found the ramp lights again.
The former Hurston neighbors now considered her a saviour.
To show what the state of ruin with its highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inauguration event two years later, and each January many are returning to the celebration.
The state backed down from the motorway proposal after several years.
"The five streams of the highway resurrected, you'd say it's detonated, real civil pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd said it more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the motorway project helped to change the city's image.
Out-of-towners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began attending the church in 1993, began to appear in greater numbers, and residents began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new one-shaped library (named, of course, by Hurston) was opened in 2006 at the asphalted and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes act as a backwater alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today is 90 percent black.)
Strangers who come to find the story and importance of Eatonville are still often treated with caution.
Permission for most conversations is to have in advance and certain things - such as murals in the oldest Eysonville church, painted by white people and depicted by black people in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, the courageous, self-assured teacher who likes the deep red, still fear that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as the Hurston festival got bigger, domestic pride has also increased.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville as well as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems, and not, better, not worse and equally proud, creative, hard-working, foolish, foolish and varied as other American races and ethnicities.
The voice of Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18-year-old, echoes a sincere love for the community as he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the police, who she says would have some help.
And even the younger, such as the 11-year-old twins of Winter Park Alondro and the Alexia Kenon, they seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most of the people, if they just come through, think, 'Hm, this town is nothing against the rest of the others,' " Alondra Kenon said recently after the church on Sunday.
"But if you really stop and look at history for a while, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we all speak fluent financially
At first glance, nothing has changed here.
If tourists in Manhattan had stayed away from newsstands and the gigantic TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't have realized they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never have guessed that in the glass-enclosure of the offices above their heads, the bankers and managers of the investment funds who monopolize New York, the worst "bad office day" since the crisis of 1929, are on the back of the day.
The messengers are still rattling the metal carts down the sidewalks and transfer muffin baking trays to breakfast meetings.
Hispanics still move between the towers and wear, like human mules, the fifties of the ironed shirts that hang from the scales on their backs.
The office rats are still in line for their morning bagel at the street food stalls, and it's still impossible to get a yellow taxi between 4:00 and 7:00 p.m. on the weekday.
It didn't seem like a crisis at all until I decided, with all the talk of pessimism, to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I timed this task to coincide with a late-extinch of the afternoon siesta at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about twenty people waiting in line.
Not in front of the cash-borne windows to collect or deposit cash, but in front of the counter where the older clients book check their books, tourists ask for directions to the Macy's mixed-use shop, and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people before me, I learned from Starr, my "lichened personal banker," came for the same reason I did.
But compared to me, they've already collected their savings from the smaller banks in the places they've come from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They have collected money from so-called thrifts (a little similar to building societies), cash associations and those types of savings banks whose branches operate in only one state, and who claim to take care of their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have quietly failed.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion-an-old outfit bank, went bankrupt, and as the New Yorkers were returning home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in assets, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
Employees of the offices and shops who stood in front of me and were afraid of another collapse were moving their cash into a bank that is seen as a safe haven and that does most of the rescues on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned fluent in financial terms in the last week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket was speaking to the phone and commented on Lehman Borthers, the bankrupt bank, and her emaciated senior executive, Dick Fuld, with such familiarity, as if she were rugging about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, a uniformed 50-year-old housewarmer in my apartment building, has changed the subject of our ordinary conversation - Brad, Angelina or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, "I now have my savings in money market funds.
I moved it, I won't risk."
Memory Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (an unprotector, 9/11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the county's music plan, he founded the excellent choir of young Proteus a year later.
He was supposed to be under 21, but by the time the Proteus sang in 1979, there were almost 30 of us, a few of us - we just refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shapes converter) represented the giver and ability of the choir to embark on any music presented to it - whether madrigals or Messiaen, either alone or with the entire orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, and all thanks to the inspiration of the one man and the enthusiasm for the music that remained completely unchanged throughout.
How often did Tod just tell us to "let the music speak for yourself."
He said, "The Tunician knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
Then sing it! "
His tactical technique was crystal clear and precise, but neither dictatorial nor florid.
Wherever the musical standard was, he always raised it up.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a conductor was to be knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades, when he conducted the Guildford Philharominsky from 1962 to 1982.
I've reviewed more than 100 of his concerts in the last 40 years or so, and I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed by any of them - and I've been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had this great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated the conductors who, in his words, simply "tranking one or two dashing-out stones around the world."
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary for William Woodruff (September 25) claims that he "return to the economic history of Oxford in 1946 and became a researcher at Houblon-Norman in 1950... and also studied at BSc, MA and PhD."
This is based on Woodruff's author's remark in the Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he finished his dissertation on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as a publication by the British Rubber Industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at the Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953, he finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff passed this part of his career.
Muslim graves desecrated after Austria's right-wing break
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from Austria's right-wing Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of Belgium's right-wing Vlaams Belang party, is taking part in a rally that presented the "City Against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, to the "City Against Islamization."
They carry signs similar to the road signs that show mosques crossed out by the red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend in which the extreme right-wing parties made huge gains in the general election.
Over 90 graves in the cemetery in the town of Traun, near Linz, were badly damaged sometime between Friday evening and this morning, and police believe it was an organized event.
The culprits spray-painted some of the graves with Jewish symbols, such as David's star, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to disguise the motives of extremists led by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether this incident was in any way linked to the election.
A spokesman for the Islamic community here said they were "deeply shocked" by reports of desecration that come as the Muslim Lenth Month of Ramadan is nearing the end.
Meanwhile, Austria is entering the round of its search for its own soul after swinging to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, which together won more than 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, conducted a vehemently anti-immigration campaign, and some of their slogans were condemned by critics as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the chairman of the Freedom Party, which won over 18 percent of the vote, protested against the dressing gaisons and burqas in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to the foods in which the relationship to Islam is perceived.
At his last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are the political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which put the extreme right on the position of the country's strongest political bloc, suggest that this change was mainly due to young voters who are worrying about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter not allowed on a trip abroad
Gary Glitter, the glamrock star who was convicted of sexually abusing children, was banned from travel to France and Spain by the court.
Officials imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after informing monitoring authorities that he planned to travel through France to Spain.
Kent police were granted this travel ban last Thursday after handing officials evidence of Glitter's past judgments for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Lowest Criminal Court in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning lawyers.
A judicial spokesman said: "On Thursday, September 25, at Ashford's lowest criminal court, the Cafes police sought a regulation to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from crossing the border into France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not attend in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, as required by a record of sexual assailants.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They must also hand over the scheduled departure date to the police a week in advance.
If he failed to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent police announced that they would not hear individual cases of Glitter's possible trips to the district.
A spokeswoman for the CEC Police said: "The Kent Police will do whatever is necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to track someone who will remain in Britain, because we have large-scale systems that manage potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting the people of Kent is a top priority for the Kent Police Department, and we are working carefully to monitor the behaviour of the recorded sexual assailants, in order to minimise any danger to the public."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok to start a flight to London.
But he said he was not feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him pass through through the passport check and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter, and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there while his attorney, David Corker, went to Uxbridge's lowest-ranking criminal court in West London, while at the same time Scotland Yard successfully requested an order requiring him to register as a sexual assailant.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the UK for four months for possessing child pornography.
A homeowner told the Home Office that Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was calm and glad that Glitter had been prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture the real character, I'm taking a master off-the-scenes." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no ruffles or costumes.
Only the essences of the great flamen of the flamenco, disconnected from concentrating on interpretation - just to get the relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
On the other - man.
The unsettling, aside from the privacy, in those moments away from the audience - then awareness of awareness can be seen, the depth of the glance captured, or the passionate hand gesticulation that is carefree because they are not about to ascend to the scene.
German Günther Bauer alternates in the "Flamenco-people" theatrical performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with the lesser-known face of the masters.
With this intention, the photographer compiles a unique flamenco iconography from different backgrounds.
The exhibition, which takes place as part of the programme Months of Flamenco Photograph (Mes de la Photographers Flamenco), "reflects the growing international importance of flamenco," says the author, explaining that "Flamenco-people" "may be any people like, but when you look at the photographs, you will find that these are not typical pictures of artists on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of bringing passion, sadness, joy to the scene... and to completely captivate the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
He wears his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the flamenco giants.
Enchanted by the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to portrait of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers for a board camera.
They are portraits that, thanks to the selection of the camera and material, resemble a classic photograph.
The application of different stylistic means is at odds with the classic basis of the film and bestows on it with the current spirit, an idea that, according to Bauer himself, is also mirrored by flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, but which continues to surprise and evolve."
What teases the audience is not the work of the dance itself, the singing or the play, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we encounter the most essential, the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experiencing it, was and is a constant of the work presented during these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
This selection of nearly seventy photographered artists is shaped by well-known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a kind of an anthology of flamenco and will soon receive a book edition that will include the exhibited portraits.
The passion for portrait brought Bauer to the idea of repeating the idea of repeating the "SportARTproject" "SportARTproject" on the "SportARTproject" tapeworm's idea two years ago.
Although their concept is different from the "Flamenco-people" concept, the photographer admits that "take pictures of people, get to know them and have the opportunity to enter their lives for a moment, whether longer or just short, - - that's my passion.
In photography, I think the portrait is the most difficult genre.
One encounters or encounters people, personalities who sometimes don't even know, or only give them a few minutes for a photo shoot.
Despite the circumstances of a similar circumstance, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
A collection of contemporary flamenco portraits called "Flamenco-people" is on display at the El Fotómata Gallery in de la Mata 20 street, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until the 16th. October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel he writes is "trouplously"
It takes place in an environment he does not yet know and tells of the events unknown to him, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement his new project - working on a novel, the main character of which is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived for twenty years in the Congo and also traveled to the Amazon.
The eternal favourite of the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed at the Hay Festival Segovia festival yesterday that the project that currently employs him is "brownish," and that "everything suggests that I should not write" this novel.
"If I had the sense, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I believe I will finish it one day," he concluded at the festival's contribution to the festival's exchange of ideas, ideas and words, which he saw in the city of the aqueduct over the four days around a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people.
The author of the novel "City and the Dogs" was one of the main characters in the third edition of the speech festival and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award for the Most Popular Writer - the old edition of Dickens's "Our mutual friend" - filled the Juan Bravo Theatre to the last place.
With Félix Romeo, who introduced him, he had a resigned audience in front of him, the hour of time passed like water - a Peruvian man, with an amazing precision and a good deal of humor, recalled how, from the original "incredible adventure" of "the joy of a passionate reader" and from "to live more than what I have lived" gave birth to a literary mission; as he supersedes the "lack of inspiration" by writing "disciplined," carefully stows, correcting and rewriting; or how they influenced his writing Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what "remembrance images" were the supporting foundation of his stories.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that "there is no way to find out if and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is mere fun, a volatile experience" - pointed out by Vargas Llosa, saying that he said "it works for people" and "make them to try to get out of line," and called on the writers to "frivolity" and "take responsibility" of their mission.
Because of climatology, he loses the festivities in Pozoblanc - a spear is missing
The spearhead performance, which concludes the festivities in Pozoblanc, was cancelled yesterday morning after the performers' announcement was confirmed that the surface of the square was not in good condition.
That's why the company, along with Fermin Bohórquez, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfights.
Adverse meteorological conditions have plagued the festivities for a long time, with two of the three celebrations not being able to take place.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the course of the second planned bullfighting.
During these, the formation of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista was to be built by the bulls in the arena at Castilblanc.
But this was only celebrated on Fridays.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and rewarded him for a dynamic and aesthetically high-quality performance was carried out on his shoulders.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two shots with spears for greetings and one ear, which had been brought to him by the open-airing arena seats than the art of the bullfighter.
Worse still, El Juli, who walked through the bullring's Los Llanos arena, unglamorous.
In the second round of toil, he drew sharp criticism from most of the audience.
They drove a check in Alava in a van with 2,000 kilograms of hashish
In ten minutes five.
Ertzaintza Roadside in the district of Armiñón (Awała).
Members stop two people driving in the van and they are speeding away.
The cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is not to be stopped.
According to a report by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government, members chased them and detained them from one of the persons driving in the van, a man aged 38, who was identified as A. A. J.
The detainee was charged with drug smuggling and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out a road check at the N-1 in the places where it passes through the border of the city's armiñón district.
They were about to stop the van for inspection, but the driver disobeyed the instructions, accelerated sharply, and drove off.
The officers immediately began to chase the car until the vehicle stopped at the side of the road a few miles away, at which point the two passengers jumped out and fled to the wooded foliage.
Members of Ertzaintzy eventually caught up with one of them and seized 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects were transporting, as revealed during a search of the Iveco Daily van.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with the hashish bales, which were subsequently taken to other police departments for detailed expert and weighing the drug.
In addition, police determined that the license plate was "squirting" and disagreed with the data provided in the delivery documents, the detainee was therefore also charged with falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues the search for the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, managed to escape to finally determine the origin of the seized drug.
Detained A. A. J., 28, was taken to the police department to handle the appropriate formalities before proceeding with a further investigation later.
Actress Heather Locklear detained for driving under the influence of medication
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda from the series Melrose Place, was detained in Santa Barbara (California) this weekend for a rider ride under the influence of medication.
A witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers while trying to exit the Montecito parking lot, a spokesman for the California Road Patrol told People.
The witness clarified that around 4:30 p.m. Locklear "went to the gas, he drove forward and back at the loud roar, trying to get out of the parking space - running over her sunglasses several times as she backed up."
The witness, who did not seem to recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear moments after stopping on a nearby highway and getting out of the vehicle.
This person also alerted the emergency services because "had fear for Locklear's life."
When a police patrol arrived on the scene, they found the actress inside the vehicle that had partially blocked the pavement.
"She looked disoriented," so the officers took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to submit to the test.
According to a police spokeswoman, the actress cooperated and excessive amounts of alcohol were immediately ruled out, yet "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drugs, which was evident at first glance for the officers."
Locklear was detained on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was taken into custody at around 7 p.m., although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from the treatment clinic, where she was recovering from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian IU association to exercise its powers in the Silva case
The U IU chief and MEP for the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that a final decision in the case of the former councillor of the Youth and Sports Department of the City Hall in Seville, Manuel Silva, who resigned from office last week after being accused of dealing on behalf of his family, will be dependent on the party's regional association.
"I am too federalist for this, it is up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares suggested of the negotiations the party will have to proceed with a former member of the Sevilla city council.
However, the IUU chief insisted that in the case of the investigation into the illegal conduct committed by Silva, "transparency" was absolutely necessary: "IU has always fought to make such matters as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions."
"May Blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), an epic gamble by Garci
In "The May Blood" (Sangre de mayo), which was inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós's National Past Episodes, is reviving the Spanish's glorious uprising against the French - the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around €15 million.
In this way, the film-maker wanted to "draw the eloquence of the characters and the analysis of the company" he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today, along with Qui Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, during a presentation of the film in front of an extensive team of performers.
May's blood with a metre of over two and a half hours will be released in theaters this Friday, and a more than four-hour series for Telemadrid television is about to take place in the future.
As a great admirer of Galdós' literary creation, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled a "child dream" by making this film, owing to Esperanza Aguirre, who tasked him with making a film for the bisection of the April 2nd consecutive May three years ago for the Autonomous Province of Madrid, he accepted the offer, saying that the plot would be based on the Epizod from the National Past.
The 15 million budget, to which the Madrid province contributed completely, means for Garci a "unique opportunity" to create an environment with backdrops and costumes matching the image of "the creasing of Spain, which was mistaken in the leader for whom he could fight - the struggle for independence led under the reign of Ferdinand VII to the decline and backwardness of the country," he said.
But the director regrets not to count on the financial support given to the films The Sad Wing (Ala Triste) or Goya's Ghosts - almost double the May Blood - so he could not shoot some scenes from a script signed at the same time by Horaceal Valcárcelo, with whom he works almost all his film career.
The director of "Start Again" (Volver a empezar) works as he is normally accustomed to - to the scene, along with the actors with whom he usually rehearsals before filming and who he does not choose by casting, because it seems "fooling" and also believes that "part of the director's profession is to go to theatres and cinemas, among other things, and thus learn what is happening in the craft he deals with."
Many of the actors he selected for May's Blood appear in front of his camera for the umpteenth time, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garcia, with four Oscar nominations, winning one of which he has won, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, May's Blood itself, the Seven Tables of the French Bilire and the last selected Blind Sunflower, does not represent the younger generation of the Spanish film scene, but claims that "it is yet to emerge."
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
"At first you think you work for what happens after that, but then you realize that you only work for the profit, so you submit to make one more film," explains Garci, with a career from over 30 years of directing careers.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of Sevilla dancer Tórtoly Valencia
Seville's flamenco dancer will pay tribute to another Seville dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, from the father of Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and mother Andalusanka (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and moved with her family to London when she was three years old.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dances.
She lived a life of passion, pioneering female emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, and Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought to abolish a corset that made it impossible for women to move freely.
This woman's life, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, bewitched Isabel Bayón.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, and she suggested this character to me - it seemed incredible.'
According to the dancer, "it's not about telling her life, it's about grasping the soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So the "twent's butterfly" evoked me from the guajira or "dance of the snake" some tango.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance also fits this aesthetic," he claims.
The show is expected to involve two exceptional personalities: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing to Isabel in one performance just as she did in the "Open Doors" (La puerta abierta), and with the teacher of the dance, Matilde Coral, who made an exception and agreed to collaborate with her former pupil.
"Matilde represents the older Tórtol, mature figure.
I'm happy she's accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it's a great honor for me."
The show also includes the music and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paca Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; the drums of El Pajara, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of actor Juanfry Juárez, "who plays the role of an eternal guide for this kind of female artists who are prima donnas with everything, and who are always in love with them."
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, which took place at its time in such far-off places as India, the United States or Russia, and also across Europe, as it usually stayed in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who have a huge influence at some time, but today no one knows her and appreciates her even less of her work," says Bayón.
The show begins at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Arts
"I recommend José Vicente Resina's exhibition "Flamenco a život" because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
They attracted me with the simplicity and strong charge with which the viewers are affected and by the consideration and respect for the photographers.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
The Resino can capture magical moments."
The book "The Daily Married" closes with a triennial
The launch of the first illustrated edition of the "Freshly Married Daily" at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), on the spot where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government to celebrate "Trienále Zenobie and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), held to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the Anniversary of Their Death.
The "Trienle Zenobie and Juan Ramón" is coming to an end with a new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, the repair of the Nobel Museum House and the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Sunbeit Shine," which opened in May of this year, and, after it touches various Andalusian provinces, is scheduled to move to New York at the time of the congress.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government also commissioned eight hundred copies of the "Soner Married Daily," edited by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis, to continue to spread awareness of the personality and work of one of the mostworld-rath Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like it so much anymore
"Sometimes God makes the perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "No Wicked Effie" and under the weight of the knowledge that Newman left, reveals his dismal vision of abandoned American cinematography and all of America.
Look how it took them to get Oscar.
And that he had been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be gravely ill.
He was a man for everyone, though.
"Sometimes you can't express what you feel in any way, and I've now lost a great friend," Robert Redford said in tears, "my life and my lands were better because of it."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
The film's father and father died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-esteem is at the bottom, when they are desperately seeking reasons for pride.
When the times are harsh and the people without virtue, and only a handful of those who are worth admiring - there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied the almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a champion of lost and won cases, from the Foundation Against Drug Addiction, based on the honor of the firstborn son, who died of an overdose, to his own brand of home food and organic food.
A complete treasure for a country that has taken much effort to get away from the suicidal eating culture.
A stormy wave of admiration flooded Hollywood, regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that it was not one man who died, but a whole one of the era.
Another Englishman, Oskar's overhead Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was the highlight of his career without exaggeration.
The Bad Man of Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
"The fox has set a pretty high bar for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who nowadays has the courage to try to live as a life of Paul Newman - prides himself on honesty and leads a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But luckily, such people are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and since then he has been married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, to whom he was loyal, though he certainly had more than enough opportunities to be.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have a filet at home?" he liked to joke.
Let him be accompanied by pride in heaven that there is a marvel of the courting between his daughters and admirers on earth - it is not very common in America.
It is said that "from all the great roles he embodied, he was the proudest of the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a dedicated philanthropist."
The perfect Madrid Olympic Games
Yes, many of us are eager for the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after the failed 2012 it will be possible 2016.
But I ask: are we ready?
If we're going to be in charge of last night's race, I'm saying: no!
He was referred to as a perfect race, and in my judgment he was the worst I'd ever been on.
Such a bunch of nonsense that right away, if it came to the evaluation and I was the examiner, it would be clearly inadequate.
But let's look at it from the start, one at a time.
Nesmyshstones begin with the pick-up of the racing number, which makes you want to go out early.
That doesn't seem bad to me, but if you go there, let them give you everything (including a chip to prevent overcrowding of the runway).
Oh, no.
Here you had to pick up the number first (first nonsense, go there just for that) and (after the proper queue is standing) - what a surprise! - they only had a T-shirt of size S (second nonsense, because I need the size of the XL).
Where do we live?
Because of the crisis, they decided to buy only small T-shirts because it's less of a substance and they're cheaper?
Okay, of course, those are the little things compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that it had to go for the chip very soon and the queue lasted for over 15 minutes, he had to hand in his backpack there.
Over 35 minutes took the waiting time, which is something incomprehensible at the race, where 11,000 people are expected.
So, as expected, the race started and we haven't put down our backpacks yet, and when we've done it, it's been a lot worse with the pick-up.
The wait was extended by 40 minutes by the rain, which led to general rebel and attacking the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow and some like me will not have the right time in the evaluation of the results because of the chip they gave me and which I assume did not get to me the right start time.
Of course, if someone had asked me about a perfect race, this one would not have occurred to me.
And so I think we will only have to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT New Technology Conference, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in the new image recognition and human interaction system in the form of artificial intelligence - not very intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks such as summoning a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger to move around the company's premises) and to perceive what he hears in the interview.
With the camera and the system that recognizes the shapes and faces, this "recepending" can detect how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they are wearing - and to listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
He can also sort out the presenters by the conversational groups.
In a demonstration video, the receptionist records a third party and understands that she does not belong to the group that speaks to her and that she is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if he's going to see someone, and tells her he'll be attending to it in a moment.
All without the blue screen of death.
Stupid.
But that, of course, is the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
There was a lot of talk this week about a change in Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and not have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer had discovered that if computers had only the essentials of the essentials, without the credit of commercial uselessness, they would be five times more efficient - man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discover as thunder, considering that Microsoft's version from the version adds new features and other "extra" to Windows.
Changing the course would be a worthy act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its meaning, and so on is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who tilt toward the theory that it was Google's first move to a competitive competition with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
An operating system will always be required because it is a necessary layer to communicate between the hardware and the software.
She has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to the mother-in-law.
That's true.
It never goes away, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system, not as an absolute truth, but of the relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and, conversely, to a more internet browser.
The computer turns on to launch Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spend more time on the internet every day than around the windows.
What do half of the applications that accompany the system do for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now keen to offer its services online and finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here I have a small example.
I took this photo at a break room for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the beverage machine that begs them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the internet.
Last week, by the way, confirmed the delay of the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's count as much as 2010 instead.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more computer.
As Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it to the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo diirte in one shining in Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond" in the "Blood Diamond," as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's "Godfather," and is part of the uniform of a muscular gay community.
And if we want to embark on the list of his life's roles, we can only dive in the image of a typical, mock-eyed muscleman who lifts weights in a nomadic circus.
Basically, it's no more than a typical cotton men's undercover tank top, fitting and sleeveless.
English speakers call him 'tank' but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels excels above all the others.
First, for his neck-and-neck name - although he is popularly called 'Marcel' - which is related to the sport because, as the legend tells, it was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above the other high-quality cotton, unisex cut, distinguished by the label and the (almost unforgettable) Belgian flag, which the models of the most intemblematic tins have as a detail at the neck.
And beware, because the Belgian firm is not only specialising on the tank tops.
It also produces a sweatshirt of college, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton trousers, navy T-shirts, children's outfits, mini shorts...
Thoughtful pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame to be just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
Honda hits for second time with its bestseller
In the month of November, Honda will launch a second-generation Jazz.
If the predecessor of this single-spatial vehicle already had considerable space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
This is compiled by improved engines that increase the comfort of the ride and allow for greater fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
Such is the second generation Honda Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes to this single-seat car.
It should be mentioned, for example, innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes to market six years after the launch of the first generation.
That's why the first thing we're going to notice is the fact that Honda needed a shorter period to rejuvenate this model than other manufacturers.
Although the Jazz is a lesser-known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case for Japan, the country where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year.
It has been in Japan that nearly a million units have been sold since the launch of the Honda Jazz.
The second market became the old continent, with approximately half a million units sold in six years.
However, Honda aims to boost the new Jazz to boost sales in its category.
That is, while in 2007 this Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Honda Jazz units, in 2009 the estimates are projected to be 100,000 cars, which would mean an increase of 17% in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of the Jazz model since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2 000 units for the whole year.
It is the arrival of the new Jazz that will make it possible for Honda to significantly ease the decline in sales in Spain.
The automaker's management thus de facto expects the year to close with a total of 22,000 units sold, which means 4,000 less than in 2007 and a 16% drop.
Honda, despite this increase in sales, increased its share of the Spanish market to 1.8%, up from 1.6% from last year.
In 2010, the Japanese firm expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the success of its next new model.
It is the Honda Insight, a five-door-sized compact-size hybrid with a length of 4.37 metres, from which the Japanese company promises to sell around 200,000 a year worldwide.
As far as markets are concerned, the Japanese manufacturer estimates that 50% of Insight is sold in the United States, while the remaining percentages will be shared between the old continent and Japan.
The launch of the Honda Insight is expected to launch in the first months of next year as it is presented to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, all dimensions have been increased for the new Jazz.
Its length increased to 3.9 metres (by five centimetres more), the width to 1.69 metres (two centimetres more) and wheelbase to 2.5 metres, which means an extension of five centimetres.
The height, on the other hand, has not changed and is still 1.52 metres.
The larger size was also enlarged.
This benefit was achieved both by using a new platform and by storing the fuel tank in the middle of the car, which had already been used for the previous Honda Jazz.
The volume of luggage compartment - which has a double-bottom system - has also increased to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the volume of the luggage compartment for the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur with the 1.4 engine version, as the luggage capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Another improvement, in addition to the external features - such as the rear LED lights or the possibility of equipment with a glass panoramic roof - is easier to access the rear seats.
The door leading to the second row of seats allows the angle of opening of 80 degrees, compared to the first Jazz.
For the second-generation Honda Jazz, the engines are new.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two 1.2 and 1.4-litre petrol engines.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology that allows lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and deliver an excellent fuel system improvement at the same time as high torque in full engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine has a power output of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had a 2.3-litre consumption of the previous generation of the Jazz 780 - has a consumption of 5.3 litres and an emission of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which reached 83 horsepower for the previous generation, the current one will reach 100.
The 100-horsepower Honda Jazz 1.4 has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and an emission of 128 grams of CO2.
"I want to be a young mother. Whoever be the father doesn't worry me."
The tremendous resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz, though of small build, is a life-filled woman.
The Cruz sisters are now taking their new exposure in fashion very seriously.
For Mónic, this means a lot more than just lending some pretty, famous girls their name.
In Paris, she attended a graduation event held by Mango at its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most insignificant fashion awards the Spanish company sponsors.
She is both cordial and shy and will win you over closely.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present a new collection, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango for this fall-from, and at the same time I attended the announcement of the second year of the "Mango Fashion Awards" and the Opera Festival and the Opera dinner in honour of Valentin.
So it was a challenging but also an exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango, for which you have been working for the fourth season, is based on?
I and my sister love films from the '50s and '60s, and we drew on a lot of input from them.
I also love to wander around the city and watch women walk dressed, how they combine and layer their clothes, I do that very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, then, huh?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has many connections.
I might have liked the clothes when I was a kid, I just kept wanting to go to my grandmother's house, go through my aunt's closets and look at her clothes.
That was a sensation, almost better than going to the fair.
Then when I became a dancer, I always tried to be mindful of the way I wore to wear clothes.
You know, we dancers pride ourselves on how we are edited to feel comfortable in our hours and rehearsals when we look in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, that's when you actually break into the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for the designers and the professionalism.
You were 30 recently, did you have a crisis?
Nope.
I feel better than I've ever felt before, I enjoy 30 years.
I find that the woman is already done, has experience and she saves her life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done what I want to do, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking of being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body demands it, and besides, I want to be a young mum, I don't want to miss it.
As for my father, I'm not worried about that.
But I know one thing, I will give my child a feeling of happiness and raise him with great affection.
As for the film, you're about to have several premieres of the films you made last year.
It's true, and I'm looking forward to coming to the cinemas.
I come from the theatre world, and so I am very impatient and restless, I want everything now and so of course I can't.
I am looking forward to the premiere of "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Let's see how you're going to like...
A few days ago, you had your premiere on the catwalk alongside Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to step up on the pier like a model.
I was merely called by Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, and invited me to London to attend a fundraising show for her organization "Women for a Better Life," and the outfits we were showing - I also selected two models from our collection for Mango - was auctioned off and the proceeds were handed to this Naomina NGO.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
A lot of things are said about her, and I, knowing her, can tell you that many of them aren't true.
Besides, I'll stick to the good he's involved in.
She asked me to perform for charity, but if she asks me to do a handstand, I will do it, too.
I will do what I need in the benefit of third-world women.
"Auto bee" prevents precipitation
Nissan was inspired to make progress in the development of accident technologies in nature, specifically with bees.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes bee flying as a model, thus preventing collisions.
Such is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in precipitation prevention technologies.
Engineers of the Center for Technical Progress Nissan Motor Co. robot developed in collaboration with the Centre for Progress in the University of Japan's science and technology research.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology, Research and Development of the Brand, BR23C is presented as an extension of the Nissan Security Shire of the Four Hazan Safety Shires.
The robot is designed to strengthen the precipitation preference capacity for the brand's cars.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which closely resembles the Nissan's safety shield.
But the most important are the folded bee's eyes, which are able to be seen in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees, which the yacht allows the whip to fly in its personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual feature, the engineers designed what they called the Laser Range Finder.
It records obstacles that are located up to two metres within a 180-degree radius of the BR23C, calculate the distance of the object and sends out the signal to the on-board micro-processor, which immediately converts it to a collision warning.
"The moment the obstacle is recorded, the robot mimics the bee movements and immediately changes the direction by turning the wheels into the right or even larger angle to prevent the collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is that all evasive maneuvers are perfectly instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and the main engineer of this project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move up and downwards or diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and to the direction that is allowed to rotate its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and capabilities as for bees.
Nissan, therefore, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, used the rotation function to prevent the robots from colliding.
"The facility only needs to process the information every few seconds and act according to these figures.
It does not require preserving information or logical intuitions from previous maneuvers, which allows it to function without interruption with just two dozen kB of memory.
It may surprise you, but we don't talk about the gig or the mega at the memory.'
This is the first step in the development of new technologies for immediate precipitation prevention, a technology for which Nissan predicts to be used in aerial cars in a decade.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be to install the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would take the driver to the target while avoiding obstacles on the road.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Interior Ministry is demanding that a driver with three administrative penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol should have to install a system in his car to prevent him from starting the car while drunk or if he is not in a breather.
The proposal became known in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will take one year.
His goal is to return the driver behind the wheel, so drivers will also have to take a course for the transport re-education.
In addition to the National Transportation Security Office, the Directorate-General for Transport of Transport and the Foundation of the Technological Institute for the Safety of Automobile Transport and the Foundation of the Institute of Automobile Safety (FITSA) will also participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between the 30 and 75% of the car drivers accused more than once in this condition will be behind the wheel again in this condition.
Alcolock should prevent this as it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures the alcohol level in the exhaled air and prevents the car from being started if the driver is not breathing before or if it is recorded higher than the permitted alcohol concentration.
Its price exceeds EUR 1 000 and it would have to be paid by the culprit himself.
A study conducted in this sense in the US in 2007 showed that for vehicles equipped with this equipment, offences had decreased by 65 % in the first year of introduction.
In Spain, it is expected that 115 people could save the lives of 115 people each year.
The measure is limited to administrative penalties for two reasons: to address this behaviour before resulting in a criminal offence.
And to help its implementation, as the legislation can be implemented in the usual way, but the necessary legislation of the criminal provisions requires an amendment to the law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any of the sales versions, although it has already been installed in some industrial cars and public service vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) proposal, recommending that it be used to install the system on school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British precision, at 5:40 p.m., as it said in the program, it landed in the presidential hangar at the Benito Juárez airport in México D. F. a Spanish air force plane arrived in which the Prince and Princess of Asturias arrived.
The sun was setting, but its rays still forced their eyes to be blocked with their hands to see the successor pair ascending from the plane.
Beneath the steps was the Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince of Spain was coming to the princess for a state visit.
- Yeah, that's great, you're not going to get people to the airport at that time... She's from here or what...
No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
Yeah, you all right...
But the Mexican press knows who the prince and the Princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport close to the red carpet and a military cordon, which consists of 27 naval soldiers ready to fire an honorary volley.
The prince appears smiling on her lips in a dark blue-colored suit, and the princess, dressed in very sparingly and with her hair flowing, has no her usual "peeptoes," apparently having reported to her that in D. F. threatens storm.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegations are waiting, they smile at the photographers and forensively pose for them.
The door of the hotel where they will be staying, one of the city's four largest, a chatty Mexican television reporter is waiting for them.
Enjoy your fear before you take out a mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the US Treasury, in addition to having enough capital to give out with injections, is not even about ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking out risky mortgages from banks with a dubious solvency, it created the popular "Bad Credit Hotel" online.
Or "Hotel of bad loans"... or a confused hotel.
The hotel, and his receptionist in particular, look grim, to think once, twice or three times about whether the time was right to apply for credit.
Above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, albeit not very detailed.
It is a site suitable for young people rather than a space for the entire public.
And what happens when the game ends?
Inside the hotel, a dream room appears.
Something, at least, because you'd better not talk about buying a house...
Best Subsidized Fashion Award
There is probably no more suitable place in the world to announce the fashion award than Paris, and it is probably not a more exquisite designer and a bonafide than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to allow for an international presentation of new fashion talents.
The price is subsidised with EUR 300 000.
The Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, the winner of her first year, yesterday looked at her designs in the Manga window on Paris's Haussmann Boulevard 54 and was almost crying with emotion.
Sure, it's the company's second largest store in Europe and has just been opened on an area of 1,335 square metres.
The largest is in London.
Many events, along with the desire to thank the designer, Valentin, for taking the presidency of the competition jury, have caused us to have dinner in the Paris Opera House of the Garnier in the end.
The Mango's so-fat-decorated chairman's desk looked a little more amazing next to Chagall's most gorgeous works.
Nati, who gave no sign of heartbroken grief for the recent death of her brother, wore the dress of the brand and the ELAH jewels over which he held his breath, and hung on to her son Luis - a six-foot-tall dandy - to her son, a half-twined - to Valentin at the head of the table at the dinner in his honor.
Andik, the chief executive and owner of Mango, took the welcome and, as a true gentleman, he and Baron Rothschild were left without a jacket, as they both offered them to two ladies.
Mónic Cruz, who arrived at the store in the - hand-designed - trousers and a shirt and changed into a long black sexy dress for dinner, was moved by the Opera Walk at the Opera House accompanied by Goyi Toledo, showed us the ballet room for ballet rehearsal, and, remembering other times, she caught herself in one of the bars and hinted at "grand a plié."
Inés Sastre did not linger for a tour of the palace's adorescence building, but showed us pictures of her son on her mobile phone before leaving.
The next morning we could enjoy the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man riding a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who had come to the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own sheets and towels and asked in advance that no smells be used in his rooms.
Stars under the star Parisian sky.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not the 1000, but a thousand plus one way to forget the chaotic and frantic everyday life.
To make matters worse, they are all summed up in one book that will bring to the bookstore relaxation on 30 September.
The alarm rings at 7 a.m. as a penalty, but even worse is to imagine yourself absorbed in the hurried rhythm that brings contemporary life.
The office is called the voltage and the computer is back pain.
Stress is a 21st-century sickness.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and the problems of disengaging from the world of work.
No, the number is no bigger than 1001.
Outside of yoga positions, classical massages and "spa" therapies on her book's website, Susannah Marriott, gathered the entire "menu" of options adapted to the taste and temporal possibilities of each individual.
The counter-study book is called "1001 Mode Relaxing" and, thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK, it will bring peace to the bookstore.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve calm in such areas as work or personal relationships, the "handbook" denies this view.
In addition, it offers other practices to be in touch with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If the veins are no longer in the adrenaline that re-balance the balance in your body, and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, turn off and focus on reading.
Talking from sleeping
Some of the kids talk at night.
I don't mean the ones who wake up and tell us briskly about something that happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they sleep.
The first time it happens, it may startle you, but it's actually insignificant.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somnilokievica.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure they told more than one of you that he was talking in his sleep at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example, once in a lifetime in high fevers), or with more regularity (every day, once a week, once a few months...), the next day the child cannot remember anything.
There is not just one reason to explain her arrival.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night-time rages, enuresis nocturna (night wetting) or sleepwalking, but this may not be the case.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fever, stress or uprooted situations.
In any case, this is a little explored phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears varies.
A child can speak in a calm voice, say the words, whisper, or just the opposite (creckles, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where they manifest with great force, it would be advisable to observe and consult a specialist to see if he has any problem, which causes him great anxiety and manifests himself in this way.
We said it was a harmless disorder, so it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
What we can do, however, is that we will bear in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Trying not to upset the child too much before he goes to bed.
So look for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV programs or series.
For very nervous children and those who get the job to relax, it is possible to use relaxation techniques to help them gain some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep in a calmer sleep.
When somnilokieves appear, try to keep your composure.
Remind yourself that it is harmless to the child and that he will remember nothing of what happened the next day.
Useful councils
Don't be him.
It's pointless because he's not conscious and you'll cut off his sleep.
Even when he talks, he sleeps, and therefore rests.
Remember, if it seems to you several times in a row that he is in a hurry, it would be advisable to turn to his advice or to find out what causes such an anxiety in the child.
If he understands what he says (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to interrogate him and pull information out of him.
It won't do any good, because when he's asleep, he's not conscious to organize her thoughts.
Plus, you'll hear what he's saying, but you don't know what he's dreaming about, and therefore why he's saying it, so be very careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you're coming to.
Never tell a child that you can ask him questions about his secrets at night.
Not even for fun.
This causes great anxiety.
Just don't worry, it's not a bad thing, it's just an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... at last
Illhaeusern finally found his way to victory again after a long, leaning period.
Without playing a particularly big match, the yellow-blacks created more chances and were able to convert one of them victoriously.
The game did not have a fast pace during this encounter, in which the attackers found it difficult to promote themselves.
After the captain's first attempt, the captain hosts Kauffmann, who narrowly missed the junkyard with a long shot, began to have the light of the top, and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne through the air, Romain on a long leg or Diebold, gradually came to irritate Dannemarie's defense.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive wall in the middle of the pitch and left only the agile Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half proved decisive, first thanks to two chances for Dannemaria with the names of Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the scoring for the Illhaeusern, which was taken care of by the Marais, well-placed to handle the ball reflected after the previous Diebold's attempt (53').
Illhaeuserna's goalkeeper, however, did not enjoy the joy for a long time, after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the locker room, leaving his teammates in a weakened position.
Dannemarie, however, was unable to profit from it and the eleven of the Illhaeusern, who withdrew a little to "warm up" the defence, no longer caused any major trouble, except for the very last seconds of the match, when the ball went very close to the crossbar after much confusion.
Sarkozy goes to the angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy takes a detour through Brittany.
To counter a demonstration of the force of fishermen who severely disrupted the accessibility of several Breton and Normandy ports on Monday, the French president decided to head to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their leaders.
The latter promised to be adopted "in a constructive spirit" and hoped to "come up with concrete proposals."
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the General Assembly of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures against the sharp rise in diesel prices, which peaked at an average of 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elysee Palace spokesman David Martinon, the president will "interpretate with them about solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their firms regain competitiveness and better safeguard the conditions of the employment and disbursement of sailors."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to fishermen with relentlessness.
On Tuesday morning, they performed an operation on "mute-riding" (surgery of slow-moving vehicles) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10km constipation.
The recreational port in Quiberon was also blocked, but services in the direction of Belle-île were not interrupted.
The Quiberon Peninsula has been put into operation of the filtration dam.
The sailors proved their resolve as early as Monday, when just at dawn they fired tires and pallets in front of the propriety stores of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the l Manche Canal, as to the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where traulers stayed in port, or to Le Havre, where about twenty vessels blocked the operation of merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area halted the blockade of the vital Total refinery in Donges during the course of the evening.
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they would decide to act before the meeting at the Ministry on Wednesday.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" is due to decide on Tuesday how to continue the path and to attend the forthcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the state fisheries department, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" as "the fishermen will not let go of anything" and "would like to appear in Paris," said, for example, Liliane Cariou, chair of the Lacentor Fisheries Department.
Occupational fishermen who do not pay the tax on diesel currently pay around 50 cents a litre, but they reckless reckons that the ship's profitability threshold is only reached when diesel is under €0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman spectacular
An unforgettable "Butche Cassidy and the Kid" has died as a result of cancer at the age of 83, at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clintons, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes paid tribute to the film's legend and politically committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery requirements for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is relying on the delivery of 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of recession hovering over the world economy.
The fourth aircraft designer in the world, Embraer, maintains its delivery precharges for 2008 with 215 deliveries, its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado, confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer expects a lot from the Chinese market, in particular in mind the range of its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has supplied Chinese clients with 41 devices in the space of eight years.
AIG is said to be considering transfer of 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the US monetary authorities have been leaked over the water, is considering ceding more than 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion given as a backup, reports Sunday's edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to investigate the sale of most of its activities outside of life insurance policies in the international and pension activities in the United States, the daily, which quotes sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
The AIG board of directors, according to the FT, met during the evening on Sunday to explore the eventual ceding.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmatory statement from the AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to get rid of include its aviation leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the insurance company Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its portfolio of properties and investments in private equity, adds FT.
No final decision on these referrals has yet been taken, the FT continues.
AIG must swiftly raise cash to repay the $85 billion loan provided by the Federal Reserve Bank with the risk of being seized by the US authorities of 80% of its capital, thus also diluting to the appropriate ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to rescue the banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of 800 points, and the Nasdaq of 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
The biggest scoring drop to date in its history (by 684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the resumption of trade following the terrorist attacks of 9/11.
The Nasdaq index with the predominant technology component lost, according to definitive data after the trading deadline, 199.61 points, and stabilised at 1,883 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1 106.55 points.
Harvested from the start of the session, Wall Street literally fell short after the unexpected rejection of the plan to rescue the banks' House of Representatives, a plan to make it possible to find a little stability in the markets again.
With 228 votes to and 205 for the representatives, they refused to provide the Secretary of State Treasury, Henry Paulson, with the means he had asked for.
Nearly two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"This is a bad signal sent to the market that sees that Congress is unable to accept a plan," says Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added, expressing concerns that the project adopted in a few days should not be "too late."
"If this project is indeed doomed (...), the relay will be handed over to the Fed (America's Central Bank) and other central banks to averistence avert the crisis, which would further strengthen lending conditions," pointed out Brian Bethune, the head economist at Global Insight.
And, with an emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piegza pointed out that "every new day brings about the downfall of one financial institution."
After Friday's collapse of Washington Mutual, authorities orchestrated the purchase of the Wachovia bank's banking activities by its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly taken turnaround and has required urgent interventions for banks in the UK, the Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are not referring to "only the American crisis, but with the world crisis," the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen strongly.
Yolt from the cash voucher to 10 years fell to 3.632% compared to 3.827% on Friday night, yield to 30 years to 4.161% compared to 4.357% the day before.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Banking house Morgan Stanley reported that the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank, is entering its centre to raise $9 billion to raise 21% of its capital. The adoption of this report was accompanied by a significant drop in its exchange rate.
A week after they revealed their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that MUFG intended to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's regular shares at a single price of $25.25, representing a total sum of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the book value of the securities as of 31 August.
MUFG is investing an additional $6 billion to raise convertible securities that will give it a 10% return and whose exchange price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley clarified that the entire operation would take place on the basis of an average single price of $29, i.e. 28% below its current rate.
Morgan Stanley's stock still was down 6.79% and reached $23.07 at around $5 p.m. Greenwich time.
"This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to speed up Morgan Stanley's transition to a banking holding statute," explained John Mack, the CEO of the US Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted the new statute last week, which is to enable it to degrade its activities, but it also places it under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Its merger with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest aces from Wall Street to take a far more cautious approach than before.
The conditions presented on Monday show, among other things, that the deal has been amended over the course of the last few days: last Monday, Morgan merely announced that he would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago we thought," Tošihide Mizuno, MUFG's CEO, explained in Tokyo, "that our participation will consist exclusively of ordinary shares.
However, in view of the current situation of economics and the market, we wanted to keep the risks to a minimum and also to cover ourselves."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay 7% less than their book value for the Morgan Stanley securities.
And the operation will result in a reduction in the profit from the share of about 20%.
The agreement assumes that the MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities to ordinary equivalence shares in a year if the latter are traded for a certain period of time at a price of 50% above the exchange price, i.e. for around $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital brought in by MUFG will enable it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its cash.
However, a spokeswoman for the group declined to provide detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should boast about 15% of the Tier One's/based payment ratio, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan clarified that he had "won up" his record since the end of August.
Recent weeks have been challenging for the group, as its stock exchange rate has plummeted by half, while insurance costs against the risk of non-payment associated with debt have risen sharply.
These costs took the opposite turn on Monday, but remained high, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "surviverner" from Wall Street's big investment bank after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch's buyout, announced that it had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
Refour the republic around the socialism of the XXI century.
Such is the joint project of Hugo Chávez Venezuelan, the Bolivian's Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
Last Sunday, the third seeded put forward a proposal for the new Constitution to the vote, following the example of his counterparts and friends.
And his mission is accomplished, as 64% of the electorate, according to the official results covering 80% of the vote, voted in the "yes" referendum.
According to these results, "No" received 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were empty.
To be adopted, the draft of the Constitution had to receive half of the votes plus one.
Two polls conducted at the exit exit and the counting of the NGO predicted a clear "yes" victory on Sunday, placing them in the range of 63% to 70%.
Indeed, Rafael Correa demanded the victory of his draft Constitution during the night of Sunday to Monday.
"The Constitution won the entire way," he assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians at the Guayaquil Gubernatorial headquarters, 280 kilometres southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa received a congratulatory card from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which according to the Organization of the States of America (OEA) observation mission, took place peacefully, concerned a text on 444 points building by the "new socialism" promoted by the president.
The draft Constitution sanctions the state's power over economics by reserving to it the "planning of the development" of a country living mainly from diesel mining by foreign companies and from the foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
The draft sponsored by Correa, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the Head of State, which will be able to carry out two consecutive four-year mandates and will be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power to run for a new mandate in February 2009.
Among other things, the Constitution consolidates the principle of free health and education, which the president has begun to introduce in a country with a population of 13.9 million, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also envisages a ban on the presence of foreign troops, ending the agreement between Washington and Quit to use the Ecuador base as the starting point of US narcotics operations.
Obama wins on points in first TV duo
The first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House was followed by a second debate to find out which of the pair, John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The command tents of the Republican and Democrats' campaign were not surprised when both announced their victory in a televised duel watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, decent as he was, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, a decline in the polls.
Gallup's institute, whose poll released on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% against 44% for McCain), reckons that the Democrat is the one who won the duel.
Among the undecided voters who just matter, Obama is the winner for 39% of respondents, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% attribute victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the supposed good performance of his fellow nominee, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his opponent, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's gifted," Bill Clinton pointed out, however, over the weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, while also emphasizing the "nausea" of his opponent on the issues that formed the heart of the first encounter.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." was the repeated accusation.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to become president," he also assured.
In such an offensive spirit, the Republican TV spots have been in the lead since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that it represented the future.
He did not lose his head and proved brief and precise.
He highlighted his ability to take the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still didn't get to understand, while Obama did," the Democratic spot reproached the Republican over the weekend for not taking sufficient account of the crisis's impact on the "ordinary American."
"During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered at the North Carolina campaign meeting in heavy rain.
He didn't even say words like "middle class" or "working." The financial dismantling clearly favours Obama, whom Americans see as more business to save the economy on the brink.
"Next week could be the decisive turnaround," influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer estimated yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "economic prudence" to the one Bill Clinton had during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the Democratic nominee, the current scourge is "the final verdict of an eight-year bad economic policy, as run by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite the unexpected leaps of Wall Street, he should be able to cut taxes on 95% of Americans, and also pointed out that the implementation of the country's eventual energy independence by promoting renewable energy sources is its number one priority, along with the introduction of the health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, plans to build a fleet with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates cautiously avoided questions about the $700 billion (€470 billion) financial aid plan adopted by Congress last night and which is highly unpopular.
"What about you, did you notice that there were any elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the polls closed on the main square in Minsk Square to protest the irregularity of the elections to parliament.
Although no results have been announced so far, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: "dictator, resignation."
Some admit that they didn't even vote: "What would it do if they do what they want with my voice anyway," says one young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which has been warmed to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to turn towards democracy.
Sanctions, such as the visa ban on 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the election is considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote count," complained Yuri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, of a diverse grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," stresses Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leading figure in the pro-European movement, "for the essentials are who counts the votes, and in our country it is executive power.
If any opposition MPs make it to parliament, it will be by being appointed and not elected.
However, their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and bills."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political functioning, because "a dialogue with the European Union is needed to be launched.
For if our economy, deeply in debt in Russia, is hit by a crisis and we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election, not declare the election valid.
It underlines that turnout appears to be too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of the voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all sorts of manipulations.
"What about you, did you notice that there were elections?" asks the social-democratic leader, Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
"There wasn't a foot in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, the ones who suit the regime are best suited."
The night's silence was again pardoned by the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
19 hostages were freed in Chad
The Egyptian commando raided the kidnappers of eleven tourists and their escort, who were captured ten days earlier, by the attack.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who had been held captive in the desert for ten days, were fed alive and well on Monday to the Egyptian capital.
During the morning, they were freed by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
The hostages arrived at about 3:30 p.m., apparently in good shape, aboard a special aircraft to the al-Maza military base, closely adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately taken without a chance to comment on the press, on board the helicopters to the hospital in Maadi, the outskirts of the Cairo residential area, to be subjected to medical examinations.
"They are quite healthy" and "the country did not pay any ransom to the countryside," the tourist minister, Zohejr Garrana, told the airport's taxiway.
Since its capture on September 19, during a safari in a four-wheel-drive vehicle at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages has been dragged from one hiding place to the other by 35 unknown hijackers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard at the Aegyptous agency director, the safari organizer.
A senior official in Egypt's security services suggested that 30 Special Forces members who approached the site on board two helicopters set off on the slopes during the night just before dawn.
"There was a shootout, half the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," said the source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He hinted that a total of 150 Egyptian special forces members from the "lighth" unit were sent to Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy, Franco Frattini, from Belgrade, where he is currently located, mentioned a role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and efficiency of the people of our secret services, the special forces," he declared without further elaboration.
He also denied that a ransom was paid.
On the eve of the evening, the Sudanese army said it had intercepted a four-wheel-drive vehicle on boarded by the kidnappers, killing six of them, including the Chad commander, and arresting two.
The army claimed to have been linked to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Movement for the Liberation of the Sudan - Unity (SLA-U), which the movement immediately rejected.
Letters - Tichy majority of the Ministry of Culture
The debate on the financing of culture fills up the pages of the newspaper with headlines and is the subject of the current election campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise to denounce the pitiful sums provided by small museums, archives, archaeological digs, and national memory sites that perish hunger?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that they are negusing their monuments and their historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, do we not have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is dedicating three and a half million euros to restor the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours, it says in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture and that this heritage is to be protected by all the citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organisations, in cooperation.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Quebec History Companies, at least 40,000 volunteers, affiliated with 211 companies for history, monuments, archives and genealogy, to uncover history, preserving a pile of private archives and the protection of archaeological remains for a few small ones.
Often, it is these companies that are the watchdogs of our sights, which are driven by the hopeless protest when promoters and leaders release their bulldozers onto old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will we finally see the grandstand for history and monuments?
Interview - Blood, which is again certain
Héma-Québec was celebrating the tenth anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, she was rightly rejoicing, for Héma-Québec had become one of the most reliable and effective blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he has regained the public's trust, which was seriously shaken after the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is generally known, a national reserve of blood administered by the Canadian Red Cross transfusion Department was contaminated with the immune deficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and a wave of public resentment, the Canadian government launched a public investigation in February 1994, presided over by Judge Horace Krever, which was intended to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations that such a disaster should not be repeated.
While Judge Krever delayed handing over the report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélinea Committee defended this role.
After the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were set up in Canada: Héma-Québec, which was to be farmed by Quebec, and a Canadian bloodstream to supply all the provinces and both territories.
"When Héma-Québec launched his activities in 1998, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system," Dr. Décary.
"The situation was dismal.
By systematically trying to increase the safety of blood products and the constant work in this area over the coming years, we have regained public trust," he says, adding, proudly that nearly 94% of the québean population had already trusted the early year of 2008 with Hemme-Québeku.
Dr. Décaryová, however, does not lose sight of "trusting is something very fragile."
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the prudence principle.
"At that time, we witnessed the occurrence of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease," says the woman who has led the company since its founding in 1998.
"And we had no idea if this disease could spread through the blood.
We have therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau report, according to which, if we do not know and when the spread of a serious illness is at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is characterised by the degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, the precautionary measure must be taken.
In April 1999, we therefore rejected blood from people who have been in the UK for more than one month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that the disease was transmitted through the blood.
This episode has shown us that adherence to the principle of prudence made sense."
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting the HIV virus appeared on the market: tests with the use of nucleic acid (NAT) that allow the presence of the virus itself to be detected in the donor blood, and not the presence of the antibodies on which the tests were based were used before.
The NAT tests have made it possible to shorten the deaf period that occurs between the patient's infection and the moment the first viruses can be detected by our blood techniques, the specialist explains.
We were able to shorten this period to less than a week.
We have, in essence, reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing it and without us being able to figure out.
These improvements have made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of obtaining AIDS through a blood transfusion.
The risk of getting blood from HIV-contaminated today is one person in 12 million exposed.
"In other words, it means that before anyone gets infected with HIV, you'll need to distribute 12 million blood products.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission occurs via a blood product.
I believe that today we can get or prescribe a blood transfusion necessary to heal in complete peace," says the head of Héma-Québek's management.
"The challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what a disease-causing element may appear in the system.
Just last year, the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted to the blood by the stab of insects.
You need to be cautious at all times," dr. Décaryová stresses that in addition to the safety supply of Héma-Québec, the supply must also be used to provide sufficient.
"Reversal is rising because the population is aging.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelet.
The ageing of the population also has implications for the blood donor network, which on average consists of only 3% of the Queens-offers allowed to donate."
Any healthy person at least 18 years old, corresponding to the admissibility criteria, but can only donate blood once every 56 days, that is to say, six times a year.
14% of people offering blood are not accepted on average because they are carriers of AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they visited a country where the faints are rampant fever, are excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3% we can maintain a state that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortcomings are very rare.
However, members of the donor network need to be supplemented in proportion to how they are getting older and can no longer donate blood.
However, convincing people to give blood is difficult, especially to keep and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so unbridled today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before they are stored at Héma-Québek, which also manages a single public bank of blood from the umbilical cord in Québek.
The upeccord cord, previously considered to be biomedical waste, abounds in bloodhoney-rich stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our 1,000th sample of blood from the umbilical cord to the bank, and we expect to be harvesting over a thousand a year.
Early next year, we should start offering them for transplants," says Dr. Décary, who describes the blood draw program from the umbilical cord as very popular.
"Some moms are disappointed that they don't have access to it," because Héma-Québec doesn't have the resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all Queek hospitals.
Football - Impact in the semifinals
Impact Montréal qualified for the first-division U.S.O.S. Divisional of the first Division's first-division elimination streak at Saputo Stadium during the second and decisive match of the quarter-final on goal at the Saputo Stadium, over the Seatattle Sounders.
Flanker Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a win-win first-round winless first-minute line, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the remaining two goals for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could handle Matt Jordan in favor of the Sounders.
Recall that on Friday, during his first two matches of the quarter-final, the Impact of the quarter-final at the Starfire Complex in Tukwile, on the outskirts of Seattle, suffered a 2-1 defeat.
The Impact will measure his strength against Whitecaps of Vancouver in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnnesota, the Thunder equalled the home deficit in the home game, eventually winning 4-3, but Whitecaps still advanced to the semifinal round with a total of 5-4 goals.
The impact should face Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series of matches will not be confirmed until today.
Briefly - Kovalev's winning goal
The first offensive trio of Canadien is ready to start the season.
A unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrey Kosticin at the Centre Bell last night, encouraged a 3-2 attack to win Canadena on separate raids.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the clash, scored a goal, Plekanec amassed two assists, and Kovalev drew one pass in this fourth consecutive victory in the three-tone of the six preliminary matches.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring a single goal during the stand-alone raids.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian said.
"I need one more fight to feel good."
'He tried to do too much in the first period,' Guy Carbonneau said.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the match.
He had a nice applause.'
Charest bets north
The Prime Minister does not rule out calling an early election by the end of the year
Immediately after the end of the Liberal Party Congress (Parti the Suite), Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Queek, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is running in today's by-elections.
"Distract the limits of our last great northern border": such is the long-term ambition presented by Jean Charest yesterday in a visually engaging manner at the end of the Liberal Party's convention in Lévis, but without giving details.
During his speech, images were shown behind his back in a kind of pictorial grinder.
On the three giant canvases, a loop ran with remarkable shots of hydroelectric dams, down, Québek from the perspective of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Generous means, like in the pre-election period.
Indeed, at a press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out calling an early election in the fall, even though he pointed out that he had a very busy schedule.
The "Steam North" forms the fourth dimension of the "vision" that the prime minister intends for Quebec, a vision of the "new economic space" that includes a labor agreement with France, a convention between Canada and Europe, and the Ontario Agreement.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the northern territory on the 49th parallel - the prime minister has recently often mentioned in his statements, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the prime minister confined himself to explaining why the North represented "a genre with huge potential," but he did not give a deadline, investment levels, or a clear priority in future projects.
At the most, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further elaborated: hydroelectric power, the forest in particular, but above all, the mining sector, buoyed by the growth of emerging countries and the restoration of public infrastructures.
The North, according to Charesto's list, contains "niquele, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds."
This 'hate of land twice the size of France's is with us', 'is in Quebec.
And he's not just with us, he's in us," he pointed out, as if to show that he was invoking a certain national mystor.
Quebec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, the Prime Minister highlighted: the pursuit of gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after he paused theatrically to view the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of the territory of Quebec, includes a part of Labrador that Québec has always demanded, the prime minister clarified during a press conference.
"This is a traditional position repeated by all the previous governments.
There is one boundary line that has not long existed in the Convention, and if the occasion arises, in the name of the government, I will recreat this position," he suggested.
Otherwise, "it is also necessary to rethink our vision of the North in the context of climate change," he said, speaking of the north-west crossing, which will open year-round as a result of the melting of the glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that taking the territory is becoming a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territories, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The prime minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would be beneficial to them, especially to the young.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequista MP from Ungava), have already begun negotiations with about thirty communities.
The work was launched by the Interministrative Committee, chaired by Benoît Pelletier, and in which Julie Boulet (Doprava and Natural Resources) is in an important position.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a moment when a common vision is set out.
The development of the North should, after all, take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
Plan North will be "a co-designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "visa" as a fluent follow-up to the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
"Like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our minds to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
Indeed, this was one of the still-roastered themes of the weekend, which was launched on Friday with a large cocktail highlighting the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's ascending leadership.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to rechristen Beauharnois headquarters at the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the Peaceless Revolution and Nationalisation of Water Electricity, to Bourassu, who created the Bay of James, our party has managed to shape the future," Jean Charest said.
At a press conference, he referred to another authority, this time conservative, on John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, as prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
When it was the turn of the Eastmain1a-Ruper Reservoir Reservoir, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I say this between us, but I plan to be there," he confided to his membership base, sparking a round of applause.
The same prime minister who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and no doubt in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling an election in the autumn of this year, as permitted by law.
However, he stressed that his program was packed, especially with the federal council's mission in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend congress gave the Liberal leader a platform for some nationalist resolutions, especially some "agency to amend the Constitution," which went very smoothly: the PLQ (Liberal Quebec Party) specifically calls for the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wishes to have Quebec appointed by a portion of the members of the Canadian Broadcasting Council, who would have a veto the veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition, the North Plan was skeptically adopted in its main features.
The head of the PQ (Parti Quebecois) Pauline Marois has once again hailed the North Development Society of Queek, which was launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it renounced the fulfilment of this policy.
If she had held on to her, "we would have gone on today," Marois remarked alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is underway today) Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of Planet the North in the government.
"However, we wish it was not just a spectacle," explained Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Mario Dumonta, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - A dishonest country
It was Vic Toews, the ex-minister of "justice" (O irony) in the Harper's cabinet, who in the summer of last year took the liberty of telling herself about Louise Arbour that he was "hanba" for Canada.
In this way, to humiliate a woman who led a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all of our admiration, says a great deal about the Prime Minister's surroundings and about Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government that is the only one of the Western countries involved who did not take back to the homeland of its national, locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that has taken into account at all that, at the time of the acts he is being accused of having taken place, Omar Khadr was a teenage adolescent.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing the Geneva Convention, is denying its word and leaving it to rot in the inhumane conditions of a child soldier.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty international, and the Canadian Attorneys Association in particular are advocating the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to see a fair trial in Canada.
The same government closes its eyes to torture: it cares little that this young man is now psychologically destroyed, no doubt permanently, after so many years of torment.
We don't realize it, but we are just witnessing the creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy," the words Harper is so flaunting about and which sounds so hollow in his mouth.
The time has come for there to be no morality: it is possible to be tortured by a Canadian citizen, ill with the use of him, imprison him according to the arbitrariness of the head of the hitherto minority government (as it will be after the 14th. October...).
Many voters believe they will find rescue in the party that proclaims Virtue, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what created the reputation and the seriousness of our country.
Shame is, Mr. Toews, in this discharge, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - Orwellian discourse by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir printed a letter from Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of the Canadian Mining Company Barrick Gold.
With the Orwellian logic, he confirms that the world's largest gold producer has launched the prosecution of three authors and a poor libel publishing house to incite a "transparent public debate" and is demanding six million.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of prosecution for an insult to honour, but a law.
It is no surprise that Garver completely misses this crucial distinction.
Or is it for Barrick Gold the best way to have a public debate to break up anyone who would dare to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the outcome of the process, the author and publisher of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable sums to be prepared to defend and fight in a highly unbalanced fight with an army of attorneys supported by the nearly bottomless pockets of the mining company.
The tactics in these unbalanced fights, moreover, often consistin in the degrading of the defendants in order to enforce the conciliation procedure, which will be floundered by the mouth of the opposing party and, moreover, by anyone who dared to pursue the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have presented its view to the matter to public opinion.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada, the debate in normal circumstances lies in the exchange of ideas and not in baton blows.
The mining company was therefore not enough to open its books, its documentation and establish a real debate through newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent science teams that could bring light to the matter.
Barrick Gold, however, seems to have no confidence in public opinion and rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of the book Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand a "public debate" while despising the views of the same public?
This word in the vice-president's world seems to refer to only bold-paying attorneys, and not all Canadians; that is a rather narrowed concept of the term.
In a democracy, even the libelers have the right to speak.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public, which supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, does so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of mining society.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and consider the matter, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, not in what many perceive as a prosecution in which the defendant's mouth is to be clogged (in the framework of its prosecution of the "public debate" Barrick, incidentally, has just given an official notice to the authors of Noir Canada to officially inform them that they should stop using this term...).
Aside from the surreal speech by Garver, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on university freedom of inquiry and the search for truth that is essential for any democratic society.
Overall, it denies the right to quote credible sources and to the debate on the facts and interpretations that themselves form the basis of intellectual activity.
In a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that are not to be liked by the rich firms of this world without exposing ourselves to the repeated prosecution, who else will be able to do it?
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have been created if it had followed the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He has the right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's overreacting clearly shows that, despite what he claims, he has no appetite for having a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as it is for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to introduce measures to limit such a type of unauthorized prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operations - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
Yesterday, the Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement on the biggest economic bailout plan since the Great Crisis of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan to use US$700 billion to hinder the financial crisis that has been clouding Wall Street for months now must still be approved by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it envisages: better control of the chosen representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money imposed, new measures to capture the number of houses seized for defaults, as well as the right to monitor the level of wages paid to executives of rescued firms.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Republican official at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, following the end of the two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress and come to an agreement that is effective in the markets," said Bush administration official, Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done in such a way that the real economy and ordinary Americans are safe from the crisis currently taking place on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"That's a crucial point: if we don't do it, the trauma, the chaos, and disruption of Americans' daily lives will be enormous," said Jad Gregg, a Republican.
Over the past few hours, the negotiations have started at maximum speed for fear of the effect of further failures on the investor's mood.
The set time limit was the opening of the markets this morning.
Both candidates for the US presidency were invited to the negotiations later, and both were more likely to comment on the deal, but without rebutting their dissatisfaction, saying it had to be resorted to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has credited the addition of an agreement on certain measures, in particular the aim of enabling the owners of residence to be retained, and the wage measures for leading labor-saved companies.
"When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate themselves on.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on the TV's waves.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, who was questioned by another station on whether to vote for the proposed plan, replied, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The rough features I have read [demonstrate] that it is something that we will all have to digest and use to move on.
Choosing inaction is simply unacceptable," he said.
The $700bn plan aims to buy back doubtful and risky and non-sale assets of US financial institutions with taxpayers' money.
The plan comes after a 14-month crisis set up by the bursting of the housing market bubble, which first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in a cash freeze and a breakdown of banks and financial institutions.
The fall of last week's first draft agreement was caused by Republican members.
Ever since the Democrats agreed to the government's liability for some of the "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty, but not to buy them, it is believed that the impasse is being averted.
In an effort to approximate conflicting views in Congress, a measure has been added to the government to allow the government to introduce new fees to help it get its deposit back if, as a result of the program, it has to take losses for five years.
The new plan envisages a first-purpose of the first amount of 250 billion, to which an additional $100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The deposit of another 350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will acquire stakes in rescued firms that will pay him dividends in the event of a profit and which he will be able to resell when it is over.
The federal government will be able to delay the seizure procedures for the loans associated with the loans covered by the plan, as well as setting limits on the level of the evaluation and compensation paid to the executives of the affected firms.
The architects of the plan would like to vote in the House of Representatives to the House of Representatives on Wednesday and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain that their plan will be green.
Yesterday, votes continued to rise against this project in both the Republican and Democratic camp.
"It's very clear that Washington can't hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, addressing voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But earning money in the taxpayer is not the solution."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of congressmen dubbed the "Skeptics Committee" listens to the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Afour hundred esteemed economics professors, among them three Nobel laureates, wrote to us: we ask Congress not to rush in too much and to examine the path of study," he said yesterday.
At the same time, it was reaffirmed in Europe that this crisis was a world crisis.
Following the end of the extraordinary meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of Fortis, the banking group, for €11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitor, who is on the verge of collapse since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in the wake of the crisis in risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, is one of Europe's 20 largest banks and the top ten insurers.
"We will not lose this money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
"In return, we get the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And that's what savers and households in these uncertain times can appreciate."
On the other side of the Channel, the British government, meanwhile, appears to have begun to nationalise another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans to the bank Bradford and Bringley, of which more than $41 billion ($75.5 billion) were loans to buy real estate.
According to its announcement yesterday, the Spanish bank's Spanish bank's Santander will buy back the British bank's clients' offices and accounts.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has had to nationalise since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a socially engaged icon
His beauty, with azure eyes, had long been his trump card, according to others, a weakness.
Has this American actor disconnected with a charming rehearsal from narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivities, and relentless talent inherent in him also distanced him from the force category that begets true stars.
However, what a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83 at his ranch in Connecticut as a result of lung cancer, and remains one of the last icons of the healing years of American cinema.
Less spectacular than Brando, to whom he was similar and for a long time he had been a rival to his film screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly a more fragile but also an apostle of freedom and the disintegration of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often breeds beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and a Hungarian-born mother.
These European roots were born into one of the famous faces of the American dream.
No exaggerated ego, which is the last sign of quality.
In it, the whole country in love with self-formed mana, a fighter in the Pacific War, was seen guilty of a beaten man who studied acting at Yale in the early 1950s, then attended New York's Actor's Studio and celebrated a triumph in the theater, television and soon in the film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a racing driver who placed second at the 24-hour race at Le Mans in 1979, and a sexual symbol, despite the fact that he had been a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward in 1958.
With it, the shaded places of this hidden, discreet, socially committed stars also leave, allergic to the fuss of their own show-business, which will always remain mysterious to some extent.
A decent man, in the noblest of the word.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend has put dampness to film lovers, while his big roles compete with each other on the black screen of memories.
After that, he has been marred by the ever-changing American Seventh Art.
The charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), who reapfalls in memory, a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the Cat on a Hot Roof, an adaptation of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
From the less distant past (1990), we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed at an advanced age by marriage that has not lived up to all expectations.
So many more Pauls NewMans had gone down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, the abused, violent, unforgettable delinquent from the Somebody Up There Likes Me (In the Signs of Hate) by Robert Wis, a roles for James Dean, taken over after his death, which made Newman known in 1956.
A sympathetic gangster in the absolutely brilliant The Sting (Sunit), the Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
The bitter and vengeful bass player in Robert Rossen's astonishing The Hustler (1961), portraying the same character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which will bring him the only Oscar of seven nominations in 1987.
This face traveling for ages, that was him.
And him again.
In his career, different epochs compete with each other.
He is known to the young thanks to George Roy Hill's cult Slap Slap (1977), from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy Brothers Coen.
He then tied his career with the Irish mafia godfather at Sam Mendes's Road to Perdition in 2003.
Unlike several film legends, which left the trade quite early on, Newman remained in the business for a long time, though he condemned Hollywood with his appetites, flamboyance, and concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier regarded him, not without humour, "as a lively induction of underplaying," judging that he had pushed too hard in his performances.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles came as a tray, the profession was not always as gentle.
But he played first lovers less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, crooks, and desperate people whose declines and rebellions reflected in his perfect features.
As director, Newman revealed the little-known pages of his shy sensitivity.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (on the novel of Canada's Margaret Laurence), starring his wife, Joanne Woodward, is given a sensitive female portrait of melancholy.
To his son Scott, whom he lost to an overdose, he dedicated to Harry and Son in 1984, a work of shame and sadness.
In the flurry of honours Newman received yesterday, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said saddened, "His presence made my life and the country better off."
The trough, the love of life, such are the main qualities of the deceased actor.
Aside from his legendary career, a great champion of civil rights, ecology, an independent film, an opponent of the decline of Hollywood is also leaving.
His likeness was used to seeing on bottles of vinegar vine, sauces, biscuits and other foods, which we might have found it rather tasteless, though at first it was a gag.
However, the sales profits went to his Hard-Children Foundation.
Newman, rather than be lulled by fame, has been involved in society until the last minute.
He left a letter to his five daughters containing the following sentences: "Every time and to the end your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to have been here."
And it was an honor for us to be able to follow the career of a so prescient and magnanimous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & Co. invoice factory?
Soon, 8. October, the trial will begin in the criminal proceedings against Yas Zuschlag and his associates.
Among other crimes, the politician and his associates are charged with fraud committed in a long-term and systematic criminal organisation, among other offences.
According to the prosecution, they used the money raised in the public tenders for their own purposes and often attested the performance of the tasks with fictitious invoices.
Money from the state and the municipalities - a total of approximately 65 million forints - went in part to the coffers of Fiatal Baloldal, in part to the pockets of individuals.
The method, which was also reported by the Investigating Authority, was that the money raised in the public tenders had been levied on the basis of the facts for which there was no real counter-value and never fell short of the association's commitments.
According to the indictment, a large portion of the invoices were false.
The forms for these invoices came from the Józsefvárosský market, the round stamps were made in Kiskunhalasi.
The names in which companies are to produce invoices were decided, among other things, on a round trip along the northern bank of Balaton, to which István was sent by Ladose János Zuschlag.
According to his testimony, the former was to look for boarding houses and restaurants.
In them, he applied for bills for his consumption, according to the designs of which the invoices submitted in the context of the tenders announced by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, respectively, and the Capital Authority, were then produced.
The invoices were mostly exhibited by István Lados with his partner Andras Őrim, who, according to our information, most often wrote the reports needed to obtain the subsidies.
On his "studio tour," Lados spotted a beer hall.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, this hospitality establishment provided catering for a 90-member group from the Biztos Pont association.
So many people, however, according to the company manager's claims, would not suddenly fit into the facility.
Similarly, the invoice issued by the Labour Foundation entitled Jobb Jövőért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért, was also high-gone.
The guesthouse in Badacsonytomaya had only three rooms, with more than ten people unable to sleep in it one night, yet a hundred and thirty guests were shown on the invoice.
The fillers of the forms with a rich fantasy, however, overdid it even when they listed on the documents of the company also devoted to the hospitality - Pigal s.r. o., in the accounts of which, according to the information provided to the prosecutor's office, the documents in the name Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even be included.
The head of the company, Győző Farkas, said that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that they were fake documents.
"Our business name and our tax number were in the wrong place."
As he added, apart from the formalities, they did not agree to accommodate a hundred people, according to the invoice, they had only eleven rooms that did not have as much capacity.
In addition, the invoice was also shown to be catering, while their restaurant has not been working for a long time.
The outrageous invoice manufacturers were also unconvinced that the prospective Budapest travel agency was only organizing foreign trips, and an invoice with a cash payment, which also did not coincide with the company's invoicing practice, they foolishly said as a service to arrange a trip in Hungary.
In addition, as the investigation revealed in the course of the investigation, they also stated in the document VAT, although the organisation of travel to countries outside the European Union was released from VAT.
The four documents on display at the Jobb Jövőért Foundation by Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. disagreed, among other things, the amount of VAT. The activities of the firm are not covered by the 25 per cent VAT but by the 15 per cent VAT, in addition the hotel staff were issued only by printed invoices, but the invoice produced was written by hand.
In addition, they spoiled the "issuers" invoice by, for example, saying at one of the firms, as the prosecutor's office's investigation, as the operation of the road hauling of goods carried out, which the firm founding initially on investment advice did not perform.
That the invoices are issued by the Egyptütt and Harmadik Évezredért and the XXI associations. The Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont was also baked because of the formal deviations - the non-matched invoice format and the false stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k.k. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose leaders denied that they had issued the invoices.
For example, the fakes did not notice that HIB s.r.o. from Nyregyhaz was in liquidation at the time (2001), when a group from the Fiatal Városért association was eating at it, which is why, according to our information, the company's liquidation commissioner also denied that he issued the paper.
The invoices were being subjected consciously
The second group of factors are those who knew to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Esély Budapestért Foundation issued the bills for about four million forints for Harmadik Évezredért at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták.
The head of the company Collab s. r. o. was prompted, according to the indictment, by one of the accused Ludovic Györfi to issue a fictitious account.
Biogate s. r. o. also cooperated with Zuschlag and his associates, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied the Jobb Jövőért Foundation and the Atlasz and Vörösfenyő with invoices worth some five million forints, for which there was no real economic activity.
Nor the movement of the money, because the invoices created were later canceled, which the organizations have forgotten to put out in their documents.
Another group of factoring firms includes those with ties to the defendants.
For example, Iván Kubatov was the commissioned representative of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió s. r. o., a fuel and motor vehicle commercialised, based in Budapest, but on which the company is not to be found.
The company issued several invoices for the sale of IT worth approximately 18 million forints in October, November and December 2005.
According to the data found by the investigation, the Kiskunhalas company Cash Investment s.r. o., which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The company's manager was a man from Romania, to whom he was to hand over the Iván Kubatov company documents in 2002-2005.
As we know, during the investigation, Kubatov admitted that he had issued invoices to the Atlasz, Hoppá and the Foundation of Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért on behalf of the company, and accepted their consideration.
In factor at the request of Iván Kubatov, the companies of the Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s.r.o. and Jos-Investment k. s. were founded by the Romanian bricklayers of Fa-Bani.
In fact, neither of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they did not get a job.
Yet the businesses were of good for him, as at the request of co-accused attorney Zsolt Szente, who had also prepared their founding documents, he issued invoices to Atlasz and Y-Generacy's association with Zuschlag on behalf of the companies.
On behalf of the firms Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave the organizations a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The prosecutor's office concluded that Kubatov had come in at 10 percent of the sums on the invoices and VAT.
To display fictitious invoices, this time for the selection process for Biztos Pont, the man also used Szi-Beri k. t.
The Y-Generáció and Szövetség and Modern Magyarországogért submitted proposals for the Miahlye Tánencsicse (TMA) Foundation for the public tender in January 2006.
They received 500,000 forinte each, but did not spend the sums on the targets set out in the proposals.
To make it out, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
Indeed, these invoices were found during a search of the home in the office of Árpad Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, some of the defendants are likely to describe the course of the production of invoices, as she has already done in the prosecution.
It may be interesting if he decides to reveal everything himself to the main defendant, János Zuschlag.
His testimony to date is not very detailed, and although he has already promised several times to unload everything at length, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for paying for a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, perhaps the Socialists have made a deal with him, and Zus will take the blame.
Indeed, he may have been offended so far, as his requests for the conditions of detention, namely to be placed in house arrest, remained out of their mind.
While the perpetrators of the economic crimes who have done much more damage that they have not yet paid for are free to walk or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have that option.
The psychology of trumping: why are we spending more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimate the goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been uncovered by researchers in the field of neurology and economics at the University of New York.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people do not want to lag behind in the eBay auction competition, so they prefer to pay too high a price.
The research was used by an experimental auction to map out a diagram of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers grated, the other group participated in a staged auction, using the MRI Method of Mertical Misconance to examine the active areas of the brains of the experimental people.
In both games, the participants could have won the money, but in the game at the auction, the important element of which is to outmanecele, the whole, under the cerebral cortex, called striatum, began to work intensively in the loss.
In addition to many other functions, this brain area plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system.
The ungodification of the price is therefore possible, according to the researchers, to be explained by the effort to avoid the stride reaction of the striata.
To shore up their theory, members of the research team from the economists' ranks conducted a financial cross-cutting investigation.
Under different conditions, three groups were bidding against one partner.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they made bets.
In addition, members of the group were promised that if they emerged victorious, they would receive an extra $15.
The third group, on the other hand, received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members lost that money as well.
The difference between the two groups was all about one being emphasized by a win and another for losing.
Members of the group playing "against the loss," of course, were willing to go higher than they were in the control and "victorious" group, which confirms the neurologists' hypothesis.
"These results cannot be inferred from any pre-existing economic theory.
They have until now explained the phenomena observable at auctions by the joys of victory and the avoidance of risk.
It was the neurological imaging methods that helped us resolve the contradiction between the two theories by now arriving at a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at the University of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Approximately half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, while in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed as the main causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only 7,000 of them are being treated. The cause is that the sick often don't know they're infected.
The name of hepatitis is a summary of the affluence of infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, the liver and jaundice inflammation is characterised, but the agents of the disease and the diseases they cause are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruss spread by two mainstreams, depending on the origins of the disease: hepatitis A and E digestive tract (for example, by in-infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses in the blood and bodily fluids (sperm, ashes, saline).
In any case, travelers should be protected by vaccinating A and B, the vaccine does not exist against the C virus.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after taking the infected meal, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal problems, urges to vomit.
The skin and the whites of the eyes form a jaundice, a lightened stool and darken the urine. Treatment can take up to two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people die worldwide from a more serious type of the disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that only one in ten of the infected is treated with medication.
hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most of the infected are not even aware of their illnesses, the agents of the disease are destroying liver cells insidiously, and so the first symptoms do not come in many cases for up to 20-30 years.
It is therefore very important to prevent early, to carry out regular depotism.
In three groups, the disease occurs a lot more often than on average: among people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, between drug users and tattooing people.
Currently, the projected global number of individuals infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
As the disease can already be shown by a routine laboratory examination, a person should contact his or her general practitioner if he or she has recorded any sign of unknown origin.
When detected early, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the organism to prevent contagion and prevent cancer from occurring.
September 30 is the world day of hepatitis, which was organised by the organisations with the sufferers for the world for the first time in 2004.
It aims to draw attention to chronic liver inflammation caused by these viruses, the causes of its origin and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Benelux governments will be nationalised by Fortis
The Benelux states will be helped by the Belgian-Dutch bank, Fortis, which was the first in Europe to get into trouble because of the spreading effect of the US mortgage market crisis, by partial nationalisation: the three countries will support the money and insurance institution, which also has a capital participation in Hungary, with a share of €11.2 billion.
This was agreed at the highest level by the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis is the first in the euro area to be in a major crisis in the crisis of international financial markets, which has been spreading in the waves for more than a year, and the decisions taken in this matter could be considered as precedents from some point of view.
In the sense of the decision, which was born on Sunday night, all three states will buy up nearly half (49 per cent) of the bank's assets there.
The bank will sell some of its capital holdings with absolute certainty, especially - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Fortis shares began to plummet since last week, with serious signs of a crisis already appearing at the institute in the second half of the week.
But analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is too big to let it go bankrupt.
The company's securities fell by 12 percent on Friday alone, to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current share price, the group's total market share capital is around €14 billion, but this is unrealistic, according to the company's leaders.
Indeed, the company's management blames the collapse of Fortis's shares in uncertainty in the overseas market of adopting the $700 billion US package plan.
By Monday, the stock had risen slightly.
On Friday, the new CEO, Filip Dierckx, was appointed to head the bank.
The cash institute was also looking for private buyers, but no one has yet come forward with a more serious offer.
The Belgian government announced earlier that investors did not have to worry, they would not lose their money.
There has not yet been panic among the bank's clients and the branches have not been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis Bank has a separate branch and has also bought up several leasing firms.
Who believes in God, doesn't it hurt so much?
According to the results of recent research, faith in God works as a kind of analgesic that could make it easier for the death of the already Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, investigating the way in a person's belief in the god of pain is influenced, the British Telegraph reported.
In a rather bizarre survey, they subjected 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists to electric shocks, while all of them watched the painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, the Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the pain.
The technique detailing the human brain also showed that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulating.
The research is the first of a series of research, which is attended by scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university, alongside academics.
Exactly the test was to be so arranged for the test subject to the left hand of the test subject, a sparkling tool that was making electric shocks.
Researchers asked the participants of the experiment to stare at two paintings: Sassoferrat's Virgin Mary from the 17th century and The Lady with the Pezosta Leonardo da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would provoke a state of piety among the faithful, while da Vinci's painting was chosen because it was not very different from the first and appearing to be reassuring.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in the MRI scanner and during this time received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive parts, while separately following a painting with a religious or general theme.
The Catholics said that the sight of the Virgin Mary felt "failure," as if they had been "taken cared for" and "san calmed down, peace has come to fruition."
Watching the religious-themed image, they felt 12 percent less pain than they did when they had Leonardo's work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved by any strongly impressive image even in atheists, only the right photograph must be found.
"We would have to find an image that they will perceive very positively, from the position of the mother or father," the psychologist said.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Preaching the faith should change and, in many cases, change our personality," Wright added.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on regulating the pain of the faithful if they were shown to them a Madononon by Leonardo or a painter of a similar calibre.
Would the view of the quality of the Virgin Mary mean achieving even better results?
You're what you're going to share
On its tenth birthday, Google can say that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as they did in the sky overhead; they know where they were on vacation, what professional examinations they attend and what they care about.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's chief executives, that's still not enough.
However, as far as the skeptics make the parallel with the Orwellian dark vision, the very essence of the 2:0 website is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently commented to the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary to enable Google's founders to stick to their original intention, which was, "Let's keep all the information in the world!"
According to a Google interviewer, the company, even after ten years of world-fractice, is only at the beginning to work with all the information.
Asked what would happen in five years' time, Schmidt said he'd like to see Google's "what am I supposed to do tomorrow?" or "what kind of work would actually be appropriate for me?" - but the software won't be able to answer such seemingly simple questions until they know enough about users.
Not all internet users know well that the searched for words are accurately captured during the internet search as well as from what IP address they were searched for and to which pages the candidates moved to after the search.
For example, thanks to Personalized Search, launched two years ago, users can keep their surfing history, can look back at what they were looking for and what they click on, which in the long run, the findings adapted much more directly to them are generated in the long run - the same logic will be based on service services, through which the system will offer us products and services based on previously stated and preserved preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I'm dealing with? - users who are afraid to look at Google's data monopoly ask.
In most cases, the extent of potential power represented by the company is more formidable, anti-reaction does not evoke an awareness of guilt, fear of punishment, a desire for freedom, or even a rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all the searched terms are not only captured, but can also be issued to a third party in justified cases, in such legal cases the personal rights of internet users are not protected.
The most well-known recent example was perhaps a coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided information to the Brazilian government that allowed the identification of pedophiles from the Orkut community site, set up through it.
But Internet users who worry about personality rights could still be relieved in May when the company, hand-in-hand with the EFF's e-author rights organization, successfully proved its truth in the FBI's dispute: Google must not be forced, even in the future, by any of the constitutional elements to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought for nearly fifty thousand web addresses and a thousand wanted terms, which it obtained, citing the reinforcement of the years-long Child Protection Act, but still failing to get lists of wanted items for individual users, or complete lists of websites and keywords, including a period of two months.)
The view of Google is thus rather contradictory: it is flogged by those who fear to provide their personal data, because they feel that their intimate realm and private life will be exposed to their intimate spheres by using Google's services, and oppose it with a revolt that belongs to multinational firms with a conservative image.
And so far, American geek culture and its wild offshoot, grouping around enthusiastic computer fans, activists, and users, appearing in many countries, see it as a new generation of big business, "corporation that's now trending," unlike his Microsoft rival, considered the world's conqueror of the world, however they both fight for the same goals.
This may be because, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require its users to be an ID code and does not want them to be given money for its apps; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and a package of programs feels much more accessible, more youthful, "cool" than the practice of the official software giant.
However, this may also be due to the fact that geeks accurately understand the very problematic relationship of the Internet and the personality rights that has brought with it one of the most shattered keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
Indeed, the Web 2.0 is about nothing more than cooperation, that we intentionally leave traces behind us and use the communication channels at our disposal, and although their scope is different for each, the essence remains the same: we are shown.
The average young person can keep a profile on several community-based Facebook sites from Xanga, which they can easily link to other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm app, recording the music hearsed music, he can then connect it all to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, in addition to being able to write a blog on which his latest photo gallery, which will automatically appear on Flickr or Picas.
In doing so, we can read about a lot of exemplary cases from which she reveals: a friend, looking at the floods of pictures of their friends in the morning, easily comes to the point with who her shackled boyfriend spent the evening with, or the company can fire his worker just because she recounts her sincere opinion on her blog about the top management: one thing is certain, the notion of private life has been completely reassessed today.
He who lives life online is composed of what he shows himself, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who wants to conceal something, or at least avoid a google monopoly, has the option (starting with Scroogle, for example, using Google's search system, but deliberately leaves no trace).
A small number of people, for example, are not deliberately registered on the community site so that they cannot be found. Google's online apps from a text editor to a photo editor and a news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and which do not form the highest quality profile possible.
Public opinion is not very secretly awaiting when Google will show the teeth.
The business, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($142 billion) or Coca Cola ($111 billion), advertising space AdWords/AdSense is threatened by investment by advertising agencies, and services implemented at an ever-accelerating pace are seriously making life more difficult for not only Microsoft, but also to numerous other software designers.
Critical observers, however, also find counterpoints that look disturbing: the senior management, for example, has completely rejected workers' protests after it has doubled the fee for the company nursery, the arbitrarily frequent daily meals of employees, according to the company's management, was all too costly, but all of this is lost in addition to the fact that Google bowed to the Chinese government in 2006 and filters out any find in the sense of their agreement that is repetitive to the good taste or interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that he will never advertise new services in advance, only when they can be used, but what is certain is that the expected problems of the coming months and years can wallow the world in new places: while some believe that Google's project focused on scanning and archiving books and magazines is taking on such proportions that the company will soon be dealing with the US Supreme Court, others are terrified of its system, in which we can build a full-way health profile of its previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google compiles a genetic database can then serve as a good source material for subsequent generations of sci-fi writers, Cory Doctorow's famous novel "Scroogled" describes with Orwellian reminiscences the future, in which one can be harmed with a deterrent just using Google data.
The two-time assassin from the O-Wed to be helped by the tracks of two teenagers
Two juveniles were interviewed by the police in the case of the double murder in Óhoda, according to reasonable suspicions of suspicion, they helped with the removal of the traces of the crime, a spokesman for the High Police Headquarters Directorate Borsod said on Tuesday.
Those concerned have confessed to the activities of the suspected possession and are currently charged with aiding and abetting a crime.
Both juveniles, according to MTI information, two girls are being prosecuted at large.
The committing of the crime is punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double murder of the Ózdu, a 23-year-old man here, was taken into provisional custody on Sunday.
He is suspected of the crime of pre-planned multiple murders for self-interested reasons.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the 23-year-old was owed a larger sum to the 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to repay his debt, so he lured his creditor to a facility in the OW, last Wednesday, where he killed the man first and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man was preparing for the crime in advance, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder with a gun hidden at the scene.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are examined by the police with the involvement of the experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange makes offer to buy Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - was offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a 100% block of shares in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
This is because the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
As the Czech economic daily E15 reports, the bid for Poles is the highest amount offered to the bidder for the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to the Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic stock exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have so far made a bid.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, commented last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of any bidders, and did not rule out the possibility of this in the future leading to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
Under the shareholders' agreement, around 90 per cent of the shares could be sold off.
The biggest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with an approximately 25 percent share, followed by Česká spořitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.l. with 13.5 percent.
The Financial Crisis in the Perspective of European Leaf
In their comments on Tuesday on the deepening international financial crisis, Europe's leading papers are already reminiscent of "a second of 9/11."
We can thank the US President for the global financial disaster, the accusations are being made by the Roman La Repubblica. The president has not even been able to rally his own party in support of that hastily sprawled bill to correct this direceional situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, who was reminiscent of billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we might be more likely to talk about the second 9/11.
He also sees the guilty man in Washington in the Madrid press.
In the opinion of El Mundo, the world economy has been brought to the brink of collapse by its lack of political leadership.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system continues to grow, for which the whole world will eventually pay.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but after the congressional vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political tool to address the crisis.
The world economy is in the air - just as one of the greatest changes in the history of capitalism is underway.
The threat can no longer be ignored, the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger points out.
Individual states can still throw a lifeline into a lifesaving financial institution, and taxpayers can save them from crashing.
But if other banks collapse like the dominoes, then neither the funds or other improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to move on through their national egoism and unify control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, the post-ending financial institutions received more than €100 billion, recalls Vienna's Der Standard, saying that fears that, like the Americans, the European taxpayers will have to dig deep into their pockets in the face of the crisis are increasingly real.
The European Union has not been seriously concerned with a crisis that is tsunami at the old continent.
"Poprangers" don't have to immediately wave hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be a good idea if they set a firm setting, in which case it is prudent to reach for taxpayers' money to avoid even more damage.
Intelligent car imitates the bumblebee flight
What would be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing a collision, if not an imitation of detectors of obstacles occurring in the world of nature?
Bees, for example.
The initial strategic idea of the surprise project, presented at the CEATEC trade fair in Japan, was given to Nissan engineers by bumblebees. It was about building a new generation of precipitation systems.
In collaboration with the Tokyo University, Nissan has designed a biomimetic BR23C-type robotic robotic control system, a robotized minicar that is equipped with bee properties, with the ultimate aim of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
"During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety protective cover," explained Kazuhiro Doi, CEO of the brand for technology PR and R&D.
Compounded eyes play an important role, allowing bees to bee in all directions at the field of viewing more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the folded eye, the engineers reached for the idea of a laser range.
It identifies the obstacles up to 2 metres before the BR23C in the field of view of 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends the onboard microprocessor a signal that immediately transforms into a collision-prevention operation.
The obstruction is caught in a split second, then begins to imitate the bee's movements and turn the wheels needed to prevent the collision immediately change direction.
Unlike any existing system, this folding maneuver takes place in an absolutely instinctive way.
"If that were not the case, the robotic car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toishyuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the Robotic Car Project.
It must respond instinctively and immediately, as this technology suits the most vulnerable and innermost layer of safety protective cover, inside which the collision is currently considered to be inevitable.
The process must be reflected in what the bee is doing to avoid more bees.
This process must not take longer than blink an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed up, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be turned.
Instead of the endless options offered to the bees when avoiding, only the possibility of rotating movement, acceleration and slowing were applied to the robotic car.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer life of the lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, the important is the instinctive, intelligent response, not the ability to process, much less the storage of data.
This mechanism must only be processed and responded to a few incoming signals per second.
There is no need for him to store and respond with an intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so he is constantly using memory of a few kilobytes in size.
It does not need memorabilia with giga- or megaabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing the technology used for immediate evasion, which Nissan estimates could get into mass-produced cars within a decade.
Another application option may be a connection of the unit to the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding obstacles, would lead the motorist to the specified final destination.
The curtly expensive child already has a name
The $700 billion in the $700 billion Rescue Economy Package Act, which is to be divided into several instalments and aims to buy out the banks' shoddy loans, is already in writing.
In the first round, half of the amount will be used.
After further negotiations, which ended after midnight in US Eastern Time on Saturday, Congressional officials reached an agreement in a days-long debate on a rescue package worth a total of $700 billion, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, according to which only the drafting of the agreement remains.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said of the compromise result: "The programme will work and will be effective, but further steps are needed."
The written form of the package was released before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. Washington time (at 2 a.m. Central European Time on Monday), but did not cause any special rise on the stock exchanges.
The draft legal standard hearing in the name of the Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act 2008 to be set up by the program will be voted first by the House of Representatives on Monday, then the Senate's turn.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, after which news of the deal was also welcomed to the White House.
"We are satisfied with the progress made at night, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both sides to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
Indeed, the program differs from the Bush administration's original proposal, which was supposed to be about spending a full $700 billion in mortgage-backed poor-quality securities at the same time.
It is now possible to spend no more than half of the 700 billion in the first around the first, so that the $250 billion will be used immediately after the matter is expected to be decided by Congress on Monday, and the Treasury will buy with them the mortgage-backed securities, which are rated as of the unhassed, and the fate of the remaining $100 billion will then depend on the president's decision.
The program will be inspected by a special body, of which the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank will also be a member.
Spending the second half of $700 billion will depend on Congress's next decision.
The Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic within the meaning of the law: it can simultaneously buy back poor quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, or other "natte" loans.
The buyout can take place both in the auctions and directly, the ministry's competent officials said.
The legal standard will allow the firms concerned to participate in an insurance scheme in which the Treasury will provide them with a guarantee for funds presenting cause for concern, for which it will then pay the company a price corresponding to the amount of the expected damage.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary means to spend up to $700 billion to meet the urgent demands of the US financial system, whether it be a large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or preventing the systemic risk associated with the breakdown of one of the major financial institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the contrary, bank executives who have run into trouble and are awaiting the help of the state can count on the government to lower their severance package - which is simply called a "golden parachute" in overseas slang.
Their payouts will be reduced only in certain cases, in addition to these restrictions will depend on the way the Ministry is to be helped.
The restriction essentially means that if the Ministry buys as part of the auction, a tax surcharge will be placed on the golden parachutes if the fallen bank directors are not sent straight to retirement.
In the case of a direct purchase of poor-quality loans, the government will act aggressively in the interest of ensuring that the money for the management is not exaggerated.
It should be added that the existing gold parachute contracts will not change, the restriction only concerns new contracts, which is to be a further stimulus to participate in the programme.
"This is the first case in American history to have a legal restriction on the remuneration of CEOs," commented the provision of the House Financial Services Committee, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the state will have the right to acquire a stake in the programme in the banks participating, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as once the economy and the rescued bank is on its feet, they can also profit from that transaction.
The draft plan includes that in the next five years, the president must submit to Congress a proposal to determine how taxpayers' expected losses from the financial sector can be returned.
On both sides, of course, there were also voices expressing doubts about the plan.
"This is not what the American citizens asked us to do, because this is not what taxpayer dollars will protect," said Republican Congressman from California, Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kapturová, reckons that the adoption of the provision was urged precisely by those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 due to the previous month, up 12.9 percent compared to August 2007, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported.
Export sales prices in the industry were up by 1.1 percent compared to July 2008, down 3.9 percent year-on-year.
Industry prices as the cause of changes in domestic and export prices were 0.7 percent higher compared to the previous month, up 3.2 percent year-on-year.
Domestic sales prices in industry rose only minimally, by 0.1 percent, given the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sectors also increased slightly compared to July, by 0.1 percent, respectively.
The biggest price increase was in August 2008 in the leather and footwear sectors (2.8 per cent), mainly due to the month-on-month increase in prices in the bag and saddlass products sector by 4.6 percent and 2.5 per cent respectively to the production of footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly increase in prices in the production of chemical materials and products (1.6 per cent).
Pricing was lowered in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), the production of electric machines and appliances (0.9 per cent), as well as - at a minimal rate - in the woodworking sector (0.1 per cent).
Prices in the field of paper production and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, we measured price increases in the range of 0.2 - 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas and water distribution sector, which is very weighted in domestic sales of the industry, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the ongoing officially established gas price increase taking place from 1. July.
In a 12-month comparison of domestic sales in individual sectors of the manufacturing industry, prices rose the most in the specialist oil processing sector (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking production sector, it was 13.2probate, in the area of production of food products, beverages and tobacco products, which has a decisive weight, an 11 per cent price increase.
Prices were reduced in the textile and textile product production sectors (2.5 per cent) and the production of electrical machinery and apparatus (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, the rate of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry rose by 10.2 percent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water distribution sectors surpassed the prices from the previous year by 18.7 percent.
In terms of division by sector orientation, domestic sales were shown in the highest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) in the domestic sales in the industry involved producing tangible assets.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices rose by 0.3 percent, in energy-based and further-correcting industries, prices did not change due to the previous month.
The biggest price increases due to the same month of the previous year could be seen in August 2008 in energy-based and further processing industries (16.8 percent).

The next year, no visa to the United States?
According to Kingy Göncz, there is a high hope that the US-Hungarian visa-free agreement will come into force around January 12, with the Minister of Foreign Affairs talking about it in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her view, "now almost everything matters just if an electronic travel and inspection, or checks, are built up in time overseas."
At the same time, she pointed out that there would be no entry permit as part of the new system, but tourists would have to register before leaving.
The representative of Hungarian diplomacy is continuing negotiations in Washington today.
He will meet with Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Congressesza Rice, who will hand over the Central Cross with the Order of Merit to the Hungarian Republic of Hungary and conduct interviews with foreign policy advisors to Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are all in favour of bailing out banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major US parties, agreed to support the government's $700 billion bail-out package on Sunday, but there are also politicians demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
After a marathon of several days of negotiations by Congress and administration officials, it was announced early on Sunday morning: a basic agreement was reached on a package to rescue the banks.
The financial package, which aims to translate the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become a central issue in the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain have consistently referred to each of the two candidates to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, at the same time as economic issues came to the forefront, Obama won a certain advantage again, and McCain's lead, which he secured for Sarah Palin's vice-presidency after the Republican convention, was vacant.
Obama expressed hope on Sunday at the Detroit campaign rally that the $700 billion package bill would be quickly adopted by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contained passages on consumer protection, which it also supports.
"We must act now, responsibly (...) to your places, your savings, the whole industry, the stability of the whole economy in danger," he said in front of the 35,000 crowd.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas about the economy obsolete.
In an interview given to ABC, McCain explained: "It will abhor all a bit (...) but doing nothing just a bit possible."
As the Republican senator said, the draft features the establishment of a commission by the supervising Treasury Secretary and a reduction in the severance pay for the top officials he insisted on.
Obama told the CBS that McCain did not have a more substantial role in the negotiations, but he himself was in daily contact with the minister.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives would vote on the bill perhaps as early as Monday.
List of press of the German language field
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident - so it analyzes the weak CSU's disappointing outcome in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to govern Austria to prevent the Red-Black Coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses in his article "The Prague Revolution Enaurs Eat Hist" the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to a well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began a long time before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took over as office.
For decades, the Christian Socialists have been rebuilding Bavaria - and now it is these modern citizens who are turning away from them.
The alternation of the period is a problem for all Christian democracy, and thus to Angela Merkel.
The debacle was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday the process ended, which could be assumed for almost exactly ten years: the undisputed hegemony of one statestre party ended.
Already a decade ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s below the 50 percent threshold.
This was repeated three years ago at the 2005 Bundestag election, the period so often commemorated by Stoiber.
The cause is the modernisation that the CSU has consistently carried out in this country and which is devouring to its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were very wrong at the pace. But secularization, educational outcomes, the resettlement of Germans from the east and the north in the emerging regions of Bavaria could not have been without consequence for the loyalty of the CSU's voters.
The modernisation is linked to the growth of options, which has its visible political implications.
The right-wing camp is intact, with only the voters inside it becoming more confident, more critical, more minded.
It is also clear that in recent weeks, the CSU has moved the most from the classical civic classes; the people of the liberal profession, the tradesmen, the individuals with the graduation and the university's education.
This has already shrunk to support the CSU below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna Journal was in its article entitled "Who, with whom? The party chairmen are reticent about the coalition" devotes the puzzled domestic political situation to the result of the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the interference of the SPÖ in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ appears open to all negotiations, the Greens do not want to negotiate a coalition yet.
The election is over, now it all revolves around the Coalition; in the debate held on the public television, the party chairmen did not give themselves much insight into their cards.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed that he wished to negotiate with the ÖVP.
And the SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is certainly possible - it exists in some of the Länder and in social partnership.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, was left open to Faymann.
As he put it, the Schüssel-Molterer course was outvoted at any rate.
A repeat of this is not an option.
Molterer responded to the red offers cautiously.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still completely open in the party, these issues need to be discussed decisively within the ÖVP.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider appeared again open in all directions.
"To prevent a red and black coalition, we are ready to take on government responsibility," said Haider.
Járóková: A vicious cycle of poverty and segregation must be breached
In Paris today, the European Equality Summit hosted by France, the current presiding state of the European Union, has begun in Paris.
As one of the main speakers of the professional deliberation, Lívia Járóková, as one of the main speakers of the professional deliberation, turned attention to segregation in education in her message to the plenary, as she is one of the most serious injustices affecting Roma children, as well as the most serious obstacle to their application.
He opened the summit - on behalf of the French Presidency - Xavier Bertrand, France's Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
For the deliberations, they sat among the invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European rights protection organisations and civil associations active in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz Járóková MEPs, the Fidesz Járóková pointed out that in addition to the discrimination that takes place in the recruitment of the recruitment force, the Roma are forced out of the European labour market primarily through their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have a secondary education and, as a result of poor quality of primary education, only a tiny proportion of them can achieve a higher level of education."
Járóková further emphasized that education as a fundamental human right has a key role to play in the application of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children may mean strengthening the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MP, it is necessary to confirm the consciousness of these connections in the broadest circles - among both Roma and non-Romani children.
Indeed, the sooner a Romani student starts school, the better chance of becoming a productive member of the labour market; they contribute to the national budget through income and excise taxes.
"Romani people are the right to citizenship of the European Union need to ensure the right to a quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their poorly and not very good and separate education," said Lívia Járóková.
According to the MEP, the European Union's cohesion is needed, with an emphasis on the aim and negotiations, in order to immediately speed up the desegregation processes of schools, which is of paramount importance for this, with the right adherence to the existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, it is necessary to give Romani children the possibilities given by the democratic space so that they can participate as full-time citizens in the future of Europe," Járóková demanded.
Everyone is guaranteed, as a 'European Year of Equal Opportunities', the European Equality Summit's objective, held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum to achieve the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination, set at the level of both Europe and individual Member States.
Fox in the henhouse
Life and health insurance companies in America, based on people's drug purchase data, often dismiss the possibility of concluding an insurance contract with the candidate.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become out of control.
'There is a data protection programme linking the use of drug prescribing data in any case to the permission of the person concerned.
It must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust the hen to the fox," the Washington Post quotes Richard Dick, the author of the prescription-drink program.
Insurance companies make premiums and amounts paid in the event of claims, depending on the health of candidates, and if the risk is assessed as too large, the insurance will not even conclude with it.
Previously, they sent in question for medical examinations and entered into a contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper course of action: based on the identification number, the customer from the pharmacy easily discovers what drugs the subject has bought for the past year and a half, from which he draws the program, how he suffers from the disease and what his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, this refers to the fact that he has a virtually uncontrollably high blood fat level, which immediately puts him in the higher-risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some determining the risk coefficient at the same time, so the insurance company has almost no work left to do except paperwork, although there are minor difficulties.
The drawbacks is that many medicines can be used for several purposes, some compounds are, for example, usable against migraine or hot flush, but are also effective against depression.
These pose, from the point of view of commercial insurance companies, a significant risk-enhancing factor, whereas the former is not a factor.
Special companies have been created for the purpose of requesting and processing the data and requesting permission from the pharmissions before they would have obtained the necessary information from the pharmacies.
They are now being forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their current negligence.
Some companies have recently also been processing the results of laboratory examinations that link with data on the drugs used, which allows them to provide an even more accurate picture of the patients' health.
More and more companies have access to the data, while checking their use will become more and more difficult to control.
There is a specific law on health data protection, but its effectiveness only applies to health service providers and insurance companies.
The bill, which will give the authorities the power to inspect businesses specialising in providing the data, is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: so he developed his program to be linked to the explicit consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the person's permission can hardly be denied, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
So the hens are, after all, somewhat dependent on the fox's goodwill.
CSU: Temporary Pardon
The fate of the serving duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the shameful election debacle, the heads have not yet fallen, the debate on personal issues has so far been adjourned by the leaders of the Bavarian CSU.
Party leader Erwin Huber and the country's Prime Minister Günther Beckstein can still stay in their seats, the question is when this pardon will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a disastrous 17 percent loss of votes, will be decided by the party's extraordinary congress on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of the highly criticized duo have been told that they will not cling with all their strength in their posts.
They attempted to reassure the enraged members of the faction and base, who, due to the loss of an absolute majority, demanded the day after the "Hazelire Tunami" to draw personal consequences.
Five years ago - true, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the peak of her career - the Christian-Social Union won 60.7 percent, but it only got 43.4 percent of it a year after the coup against Stoiber.
The CSU was a "saman" in Bavaria, producing 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
While the conservatives in the southern federal state, which is of key importance for the Hungarian economy, continue to be in a high position, they will in any case be forced to take a coalition in the future.
One of the first signs of intra-party reorganization is that a member of the narrow intelligence team to begin probe negotiations on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, or the right-leaning Free Voters group, will also be the deputy chairman and federal agriculture minister, Horst Seehofer, who is considered a possible successor to Huber.
It is ironic to the fate that Gabriele Pauliová was put into the assembly on the Free Voter ticket, with the Huber-Beckstein duo taking advantage of her appearance against Stoiber to carry out the coup, but then they made a mercilessly briefed process with an ambitious municipal politician.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition period, the active role will also go to Stoiber, who has so far spanted threads from the background, with the former country's prime minister and former CSU president calling the bitterest day of his political career on September 28.
On Monday, Huber made some snide remarks to the CDU, saying they would have deserved much more support from their sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor if the CSU, which played a major role in its national success in 2005, will not be on its feet by joint forces.
According to Merkel, who found it hard to hide her disappointment because of the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: treating the wounded CSU will not be easier, and the Social Democrats' crisis continues.
The SPD achieved its weakest result in Bavaria with 18.6 percent of its weakest result since 1946.
Lukashenko:opozice - 110:0
In Sunday's elections, not a single opposition member made it to the Belarusian parliament.
This can be explained, according to Russian observers, by the well-being and stability prevailing in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the illegalities that were counted in the census of votes.
The OSCE, which sent out 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the 110-member legislature of the 10m-pronged country has lacked the opposition well for a decade, the opposition, affiliated under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) before yesterday's election, seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who had, based on amending the constitution in the elections with a debatable course in 2006, and for the fourth time, re-reported to rebuild his presidential mandate for the fourth time, this time "allowing" for several opposition members to appear in parliament.
The ODS thus also abandoned the boycott under consideration.
In the background to the opposition's expectations, it was that Russia's increasingly economically dependent Belarus - which had taken credit to mitigate the impact of Russia's ever-greasing natural gas import and had also contributed to bringing the pipelines-borne pipelines through the country into Russia's hands - to improve relations with the European Union, where, because of the Belarusian political establishment, judged as the anti-democratic Lukashenko, and other high-ranking politicians do not receive an initial permit.
The release was previously pointed out by the fact that the OSCE, when evaluating the election campaign, emphasized positive shifts and not shortcomings - for example, to ban the nominee for a third of the opposition candidates.
Monday's flash report by the OSCE, however, already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not essentially appear in the press, especially the fact that the opposition cannot be present at the vote count.
At the same time, according to the opposition, improvements can be felt in the political system after all: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to engage in minor confrontations with Moscow, when he continues to refuse to recognize the secession of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a union state on paper, has considered the two territories to be independent for a month.
"We took two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkevich told our paper.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable for it to remain so, even though "the power has been alarmed to let a single member of the opposition into the insignificant parliament."
Looking at the opposition's results, it does not plan protest actions, rather it seeks to deliver its message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"We have a lot of problems with that, of course, we have to print opposition papers in Russia, the distribution is put in the way of the local authorities, but I can still see that more and more people are supporting the change, even among the elders," Milinkevich said, pointing out that the Lukashenko regime, which sees the creation of social safety as its greatest success, is not considered by the most officially supported layer of pensioners to be the right.
"Because of the country's indebtedness and the rise in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the social safety of the 'reporting cemetery' silence collapses," Milinkevich says.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers viewed the election as democratic.
The head of the U.S. U.S. mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Sergei Lebedev, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti that "people do not believe in words but actions," so that the absence of the opposition is nothing more than evidence of the maturity of the Belarusian electorate.
Global Marseille menu
The European Union and India will double the turnover of trade
As the European Union and India are mutual leading trading partners, this was dominated by the agenda of the ninth-level summit, in addition to other, largely global challenges.
The Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, primarily to discuss cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
Indeed, the European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given a greater opportunity to speak to international affairs, but member countries have so far failed to find a common denominator to support New Delhi's permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
This question was not even further discussed at yesterday's, already the ninth summit, held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union and the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso and the High Representative for Foreign Policy, Javier Solano, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed to double the turnover of trade within five years, or would rise to more than a hundred billion euros.
As the exchange of goods rose from 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, it is not an overly ambitious target.
As a sign of this, twenty-six already existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation were aligned in legal terms, bringing the green light to air transport in the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised that negotiations would be accelerated.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India's first trading partner, with New Delhi ranking only in ninth place among the EU's partners.
The summit also paid attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, respectively - both sides have condemned it in all its forms and called for the swift convening of the UN conference.
They also concluded the round of business negotiations from Doha, although both are a large contributor to his failure so far.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate agenda, that it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agreed to this, as well as the fact that next year's climate conference would need to be struck by a global agreement and the production of gases causing the greenhouse effect by 50 percent by 2050.
Both sides would also like to prevent food prices from rising and support the convening of an international conference to analyse the financial crisis.
India's prime minister arrives today in the French capital, where he is planning to do business in a bilateral meeting on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
Paris believes that French firms will receive a mandate to build Indian nuclear reactors worth twenty billion euros.
According to agency reports, the agreement would be valid for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
The large participation of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair is expected to attend this edition by more than 7,000 exhibitors from a hundred and one different countries, taking on the 171,790-square-foot trade fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to be seen, with Turkey as a guest of honour.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inauguration ceremony in the Italian pavilion: Italy will in fact attend institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – on 264 square metres of the exhibition space.
This will be followed by a meeting with the press in Room Struktur Buchmesse in Pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to introduce numbers, tendencies and perspectives in terms of the state of the publishing house in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign authors' books in proportion to the overall Italian production is still diminishing, mainly due to the literature for children and adults.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast before work"
It is the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace that a revolving door has been introduced when the staff arrived and out.
But from now on, this new measure will begin to work against the cunning people, against those who inject and then go for coffee during working hours.
The news against the lazy was launched today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renat Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Mauro Masi.
"The wrinkle door - says Brunett - is a tool for better work, higher performance, more full-time and more services" specifies the minister.
"A new period of responsibility and transparency will now be opened.
This is about reformism," Brunett stresses.
We will complete the Chigi Palace with the introduction in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Board.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving door is also important from a symbolic point of view."
There were no objections from the staff side, the secretary-general assures: "This was a joint action with the workers and the cooperation of all."
In short, no more breakfast during the working hours; no more coffee and a croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "she's no better than a proper cappuccino at 7:00 in the morning."
During one conference at the Higher Vocational School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister will eventually announce that in the three months the absence of public servants for the illness has decreased by 50%, that is to say 60,000 more people per year at work."
And it will add that it is imperative that the Italian public administration become more efficient
"its pay-as-you-go dynamics – the minister explains – has doubled in the last 8-10 years, given the private sector, and is far higher than the inflation rate'.
Meanwhile, thousands of public servants have gathered to reject the Brunett decree's standards in line with the Codacons-supported request.
"While the Public Administration Secretary will today present the figures on lower absences from work for illness - writing to the consumer protection association - the 'pilcent loungers' nation is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and fair public service employees who have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate standards contained in the decree."
Tara will primarily be protested against the exclusion of sickness benefit allowances that depend on the activity; an extension of the time at which the patient can be checked, in what time span will be carried out in the time span, and against other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Industrial accidents, Napolitano: "Recoccupation Prevention"
There are 2,500 accidents at work every day in Italy, three people die and 20-seven remain permanently disabled.
Inail's values confirm that for 2007 we have about 1,200 deaths as a result of accidents at work.
These values testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main reasons for the death and causes almost double the deaths compared to the murders.
To reaffirm the attention of the institutions, social and information means of information about this dramatic problem, Anmil is today celebrating in all Italian regions the 58th national victim of child injuries set for the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmilem and the same tragic reports of these days confirm the important issue of job security," confirms the President of the Republic of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in a report sent to President Anmil, the National Association for Crippled and Invalides for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his keen admiration for a constant joint effort to ensure safety in jobs, to protect the injured workers, to help the families of the victims, and to complicity of public opinion.".
"Naturally, outraged 'seven' has been raised, genuinely shared in the face of the tragedies that are causing a stir in the media and the participation of public opinion in their scope, but the day-to-day reality once again offers us dramatic cases, even repetitive in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is no doubt a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
There are a large-scale initiative in the field of education to make young people facing the world's work a clearer awareness.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up on its worrisome social seriousness, to apply and to improve legislative standards.
The chamber's president, Gianfranco, stressed to his part of the chamber, "how the phenomenon of death resulting from an accident at work creates an absolutely critical social condition, how it offends everyone's conscience and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort to bring about the necessary cessation of this state."
"As for the data of occupational accidents, they appear to be showing some positive turnaround, but this does not deny that the number of deaths resulting from a work-related injury is equally alarming," President Anmil Pietro Mercandelli noted again.
"We would not want this "trade-reduction" effort to lead to less attention, because it is the moment the attention is stopped that tragedy breaks out.
"We believe that there is still too little to stop the problem of injuries, and there are many activities that can have an impact on the problem.
It is essential, in our opinion - Mercandelli stressed - to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of training for workers, from the age of the school."
"There is still a need for further efforts - he added - in terms of communication and participation of public opinion.
But it is mainly necessary to make a greater sense of responsibility by employers to the phenomenon that represents an exceptional social phenomenon ."
Mercandelli eventually said it was a progressive degeneration of the right to compensation presumed for job victims and the "deletion of supportive care" that the system has been coming to in recent years."
"The goal, then, is to return the worker's insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who harm must not depend on the spontaneity or gifting with the legislator from time to time."
Mp3 players charged, expose hearing to be heard
Listening to loud music for a long time and use portable music devices as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to a European Commission notice published today, which, in an official report, extended in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Committee on Science of the Health Risks, which has recently arisen and been identified (Csrseri) Eu.
"From this scientific opinion - we read in the notes - it follows that 5-10% of those who listen to music using portable music machines for at least five years, more than an hour a day per week and keep the device at high volume, risking a permanent loss of auditory ability."
"It worries me that such a large number of young people who use often portable music machines and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unwittingly damage their hearing in an incorrigible way," admits Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings - the lead leader go on - show a clear risk and a rapid response must be addressed.
The most important thing is that we need to encourage consumers and publish this information.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding in order to make them completely effective and to keep up with the new technology'.
Brussels has asked for the Independent Scientific Comet to explore the problem due to the high use of portable music machines and the growing number of young people exposed to the noise of this origin.
"Scientists - concluded by the Executive Officer of the Eu - confirm that it is necessary to worry and now the European Commission will examine, together with the other members and parties, which have raised the problem of what measures could possibly be implemented and thus better protect children and young people from noise exposure, the source of which is portable musical instruments and similar devices.
A European safety standard is already in place, capping the noise level of portable music machines to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about hearing impairment, which may be caused by an overexposed exposure of similar forms of noise.
It is possible to very limit these damages by looking for solutions such as a reduction in the level and duration of exposure.
In its beliefs, the Scientific Committee Eu states that users of portable music machines, when using loud music (more than 89 decibels) for just five hours a week, exceed the currently applicable limits corresponding to maximum-protected noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a long time risking permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should affect 5-10% of users of such devices, and the amount of these devices can be calculated between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Eu.
Rome, Alemanno will let the Commission for the Future of the Capital Open to Run Away
We will start today, close in March, we will have sums in June.
Such is the Campidogliem calendar to the staff of the "City of the City of Rome" staff, which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the Caracal Plaza Spa.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and another 49 members of the commission will draw up a guidebook for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that they can present a strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of Campidoglio and its councillor Gianni Alemann.
"The Commission is completely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are included - to emphasise Alemanno - He will have to secure proposals for the development of Rome, which will ultimately be used by the political arbitrators, which remain Giunta e the Municipal Council.
It is not about any exchange of functions, but only an attempt to have a place to process a major project for Rome.
Work will be completed in March and then dissolved because the institution must have an exact time-lapse.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present a strategic plan and use the work done by the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome'.
To those who accuse the Commission of futility, given that its opinion will not be binding, Alemanno will say: "It is all about the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of their proposals.
If they are of good quality, as are the Commission's proposals, and I am sure of that in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics is sprawled on the daily problems and the urgencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective , to work seriously to the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wants to stress that "this Commission is neither an unnecessary undertaking nor a bluff: it is absolutely free, the Roman citizens will not be cost or the euro and will serve to think and engage in the best intelligence that the capital has."
For Alemann, basically, "you need to have a strategic sketch as a starting point, or a definite, neither definitive nor immobile, to allow our city to take an authentic rise at the level it needs and think with a unified spirit of its future."
The future, which, the mayor of Rome, clarifies, will not be limited to the current municipal borders, but will look much further away" not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as the capital, but "will also include the role that Rome can and must perform as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama? First anti-American president. It's already known why
An acquaintance of the US president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the other anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, with his decisions, decimated the US economy and maintained relations (as today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam."
Attacks against Obama are mounting just as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on the website: "This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has the gall to be: he thinks he will get to the highest post of nation, which had two governors and five black senators!."
In fact, these attacks don't say much"; are attacks unequivocally racial in origin, and they don't answer the voter's question: will he be a good president? And then we have the polls; everyone says Obama will win and by a wide margin.
In this case, too, there are those who act by the heart and not by the brain.
One newspaper from the Mississippi, from the bowels of the southern United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the electoral stall, we know well who an American patriot will give his vote to.
One page of the American mentality will come out to the ashore, which remained skytsi until the last moment.
Say what you want, we'll eventually take care of it ourselves, who to check, whether to Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost a certain success for a black candidate.
But for all this reasoning for the Democrats, George Bush's main weapon is the main weapon.
They asked 1,500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his mandate? Eighty-nine percent said, Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost fifty thousand soldiers and was sent home with kicks in the ass.
The lives of 4,500 soldiers were lost in Iraq, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet, Iraq became a weakness for most of Bush.
Who will take the place of Georgia W will have to perform a huge task.
The economic collapse of the US was also felt by journalists: the paper is the IP. And many accuse the internet, the "killer" of the press.
The PEW Research Center asked five hundred journalists about the state of their profession and the assumption of the future.
Well, today almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the respondents did not openly say they had less to worry about credibility.
They don't feel isolated as they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis-stricken economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, the room where the editors work to put together a newspaper, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists surveyed, this is a problem that needs to be solved, if we do not want traditional journalism to be fundamentally changed to the way it is understood by the general public.
The American journalist is permeated by clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten print-talk journalists and the executive seniors believe that journalism is going the wrong way on a national scale.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against the broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the site is going.
Larger publishers are making their way to the internet, which many view as a "killer" of printed matter.
The "Economic Curate," highlighted by journalists, has increased by as much as 79%.
Five hundred journalists surveyed admitted to resorting to technology in the hope of "doing something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism is among those who manage the newsrooms - that is, the leaders - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are sure that their reporters share their values, while the value at the local level is down to 23%.
This has to do with "workcourt assurance" for someone.
Leaders who think they will lose their jobs in three years are at the national level of 47%.
As for journalists, they're at 30%.
As for "certain work" involving staff (our editors, ndr) in America, it is still a daily occurrence.
Only 13% of journalists are working on a contract.
In a nation as huge as Usa, with three hundred million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, tv and the internet, employers often offer what they want, so it is a question of taking or letting.
The executives almost always get huge salaries, and the editor can earn even $10,000 a month outside of paying for pensions and insurance.
As regards holidays, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year to reach 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, according to their own confession, often get sick during the course of a year.
It is merely a climate issue.
UNIPOL: THE COURT IN ARRANGEMENT, DANILO COPPOLA IN GROTTTERRATOR
The president of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to dismiss the filing of real estate entrepreneur Daniel Coppola, who requested to be able to move from his city, the Grottaferrats, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in connection with the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial, at his own expense, he received his release from house arrest last week, which was converted into a forced residency in Grottaferrata.
His attorneys, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, have asked that a real estate entrepreneur be able to change his whereabouts from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (against to which he expressed pm) allowed him to influence his company and access the evidence that accusing him of.
Elites in danger
This phenomenon was already apparent a few days ago, when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the rescue plan to provide the $700 billion presented by the White House: a significant proportion of Americans were more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving economics.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis will tear apart the Republican Party, constantly divided more divided between its old soul of the East Coast, the gentler, the friendly to the federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which, on the contrary, is conservative, hostile to the "court" from Washington» and the world, strong especially in the states in the central and the south.
The soul that arrogantly manifested itself in the vote I spoke about at the beginning.
But this particular thing is just a case-pronlined, a major change that the current economic earthquake is already showing: not only in the United States, but in the whole of the West, and perhaps perhaps not only here.
Both in Usa and in Europe, this crisis seems to be operating as an accelerator of phenomena that have been incubate for a long time, which have been tightening up in the new climate and are finally coming into the light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-updation, the extraordinary recovery of the market, the double category of the State-Emire in relation to a certain re-nationalisation of economics.
The crisis is indeed a crisis in the banking financial institutions, which of course have strong ties abroad, but in which, above all, the largest budgets of people and families living in a single country are included.
Which created a political problem for those who run it: that means responding to the difficulties and protests of people and families, who are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis appears to be world-wide, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be substantially out of the picture or that it has nothing much to add: the European Union, which is divided as always between different interests and different state strategies, has given the obvious proof and which cannot decide on one common political line.
And so everyone is facing the intervention of the government of each individual state, the rescue plans, the revival of the market, the new rules and, above all, the distribution of the funds: the moment we get into distress, only the states have economic means, a multitude of financial resources, to be able to try to get everything in order.
And they also own the necessary means and the permissions to use them: two sources of immense value, in certain circumstances that perhaps no market and any international organisation will ever be able to dispose of to a similar extent.
This new emphthasis, which the crisis places on the national element, is, in complete harmony with the increasing importance that attempts to attribute the latest economic advances to one factor closely linked to it: territorial jurisdiction.
In fact, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of vita, increasingly sophisticated technology, imaterial, while we were convinced that the global finance was already destined to rule the world, we suddenly realized that our future would have to be increasingly grappled with such poor, immense things as water, grain, nafum.
All the things who would say that can be transported from one place to the ground to another, but they are in any case connected, absolutely, to the bounded space, the territory.
So, whoever becomes their ruler certainly has a lot more cards up their sleeve than who isn't, and who's unlucky to live in a place without grain, without diesel or water.
I'm getting to the second news, which foresees a break.
Who speaks of the territory, the state, the government, inevitably talks about politics, that is, about leadership.
Taking into account the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena appear to be forming.
On the one hand, the realization that there is an objectively need for authoritarian leadership, a request for someone who could take up the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discreditability to existing leadership, especially economic, which has proved equally unsatisfactory and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and, in a sense, unsettling: discrediting, impatience, a sense of incompetence and absence that seek to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
Indeed, it seems that it is increasingly expanding in the broad masses of the population of the beliefs than their actions as their ideas of the hitherto popular elite, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the truest sense of the word, that the elite have surpassed their time and are indifferent to the views of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership nourishes one branch from the underground, but a strong movement to remove the ruling classes and the traditional political order is reflected in the sudden election"offs», or in the unexpected changes in collective sentiment in recent and most recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavorsk to the fall of Labour in the UK, to the rebellion of US congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy has much to do with it).
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, some would say their format, they have increasing problems to understand, that is to say, to represent, which, not from today, is being created in the deep sections of Western societies and that the economic crisis is re-emantic, growing, potentially over-sloughing.
Before this, it would be an exaggeration to talk about a permanent "mask revolt».
But I'm sure we can't say it means having your eyes open.
Super glue to walk on the walls
Overcoming the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walking on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
Scientists managed to retain the 100-kilogram body glued to the vertical wall with a sticker of just 2.5 square centimetres.
STUDIUM – The American Journal of Science published the discoveries of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by a team of researchers is the development of materials that already in existence use a special carbon structure called carbon-based carbon pipes.
«We can imagine the basis of glue as a series of pipes laid out as a arranged pile of spaghetti» is explained by Zhong Lin Wang of the Institute of Georgia of the Atlanta Institute of Technology.
Scientists were inspired by the legs of the gecon, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to provide the perfect adherence.
Tests conducted on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new glue is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time"is simply to be removed from the wall» by Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Consumers of the University of Technology.
CHODIT'S WILLES? -"This material could be useful as a makeshift glue» is supplied by Liming Dai.
Walking the walls like Spiderman, perhaps? Perhaps so, but the researchers think of far less fascinating use as a combination of electrical devices, because dwarf carbon pipes are heat and power conductors.
Other applications could be about aerospace engineering.
For now, no super heroes.
OTHER RESEARCH – Also, the University of Berkley, California, is researching a new glue.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, California scientists introduced groove-formed micro-fibre adhesive as hair that is self-cleaning from dust to the surface to still maintain perfect fitting.
Medications: Never with juices
Watch out for the grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed primarily in summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, together with some of the life-saving medicines, their ingestion changes to the enhancement or reduction of efficacy with serious health consequences.
To highlight the risks of both finished and fresh juices in the United Nations University in London, to highlight the risks of juices, combined with the use of some drugs, the American Chemical Society's current 263rd National Meeting in Philadelphia is raising a new alarm: one glass of grep, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some life-saving medicines, to nullify their beneficial effects, and put patients at risk to health.
Gear juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing the effects of some anti-aritemic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolic, antihistamine and neurological drugs to the toxic level.
MEDICES IN RISIKU – This was announced by the Italian Medical Agency itself in an information bulletin two years ago, galvanizing doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers of this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink if they take medication, such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NOT ON GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that dampen the drugs.
A long list of effects of the abducted grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the challenge of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department at the State University of Milan:"Such discoveries are usually immediately announced to the various international and national pharmacy agencies, which eventually arrange and exchange information instructions for drugs.
So read always the illustrative leaves of the drugs you get and if you come across something unclear, don't be alarmed, but ask a doctor or pharmacist to clear up» the expert for the Ansa agency stressed.
The Nobel for Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies in commercial models and localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Newsonian who teaches at the University of Priceton and who is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics in the Bush administration's foreign, economic, and political moves.
A few months after the assassinations in September 2001, the days on the days when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in a commentary published in the New York Times that the second event would be, in the sense of implications for the history of the United States, to be far more important than the first.
A prediction that sparked more than a few polemics and that had been blamed for years, but which proved to be accurate.
«I am surprised and shocked by the speed with which collapses such as Enron and Worldcom disappeared from the public interest, Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini, Smaghi of the Central European Bank's executive committee, Krugman is a "economist of great importance», but also a popularizer who has" a very aggressive style, particularly critical of the Bush liberalist administration's excesses».
Open Office, we have the third release of the package "anti-Microsoft»
It's the release day of Open Office.org 3.0, the open source personal production package that is moving toward more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the better-known Microsoft Office.
After about a year of work by volunteer workers, controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with various new releases: the welcome screen, and the revised and improved opening window will be added to the revised and improved opening window, far more essential, as a compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and support for the new Open Document Format format.
The emphasis is also on the collaboration with the Office 2007 package, Open Office is also able to open the document with the new Microsoft suffix (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models, such as what allows you to reduce the dimensions of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the ability to transfer the PDF folder to the graphics design model and maintain the original appearance of the page.
This is still the point of view, we can create "PDF hybrids" documents that resemble a typical Adobe graphic and have the properties of a spreadsheet or a text program.
Cooperation is an element that has gained many improvements within application programs: in excelllu, it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text program each collaborator is assigned one color to commentary to make the identification clearer in the reviewing phase.
Some firms are also working to transfer some of the Open Office features to the Web (on the cloud) and should redo a definitive result in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, has been added to the English version, which is located on the mirroro from Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
Also, the installation cd can be sent to home or to the workplace upon request.
And if the topic of free of charge can be a draw to expand in homes, it is on the Open Office business area that the package bets a lot, and can already count on the various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
And there are also offers of training, consulting and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video typing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet that goes to the Excel replacement; Impress for presentations similar to Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, ultimately, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that as of today we are almost at 3 million and 600,000, with the release of a new version it is possible that this projected number can even be surpassed.
Kohl's results are also positive, this is the fourth case of doping
A new positive case in the last Tour de France: it is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third classed and winner of the best top scorer's T-shirt.
The report was quoted as saying in the L'Equipe newspaper's website.
26-year-old Kohl is the fourth driver positive for Cero, Epo third-generation, after the Italichs Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl's blood samples are those made in recent weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control analyses confirm the positivity at Ceru, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and will have to face the set two years of the disqualification.
The report on the positivity of Kohl at the third-generation Epo is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who reported to the Associated Press that he had already informed the outcome of the Austrian government authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evansema, and also won the top-best top-flight T-shirt.
IMIGRANTI:NEW YORK TIMES WITH THE TRAIN, ITALY RASISTOUS?
Italy "as a country of emigrants, only in the last house has been transformed into the priority of the immigrants" accepted with resistance.
Does this turn a beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what they are asking in a long New York Times article that addressed this article to the debate on racism in Italy, and began with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, killed in Milan last month because he stole a box of biscuits.
This case is made visible by what the New York Times defines the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are at the same time the ones where "more integration and more work" are registered, but also "the country's most powerful anti-immigrant thinking and the Northern League's strongest support."
To confirm the increasing tensions between Italians and immigrants, the NYT cites instances of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not only that.
The new legislation required by Lega, which seeks to hinder immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
Tendency, highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, having met with Benedetto XVI in Quirinale, asked the state and the church to work together to defeat racism."
Found plane of Steve Fossetta, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of the plane was found by Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying across the desert in Nevada.
The debris was discovered on one plateau at an altitude of three thousand meters, in the Mammoth Lakes area of Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the aircraft.
The Sheriff of County, John Anderson, dispelled the doubts that remained: "The plane was found, we sent a team there, and now we are sure that this is exactly what Steve Fossett flew in the day he disappeared" he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore clarified that the human remains were not found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The US Transportation Safety Agency (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the wreckage was recognized, an investigative team was sent to eventually identify the plane: it is exactly the Bellanc 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal items were found with one pair of pales close to their dwelling in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both released by the Illinois Federal Air Administration, cash and one jacket.
Fossetta's search was discontinued a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire won a place in history with a long collection of first.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a trip around the world in an air balloon: a two-week flight alone.
Three years later, he circled the world on the plane and without landing.
His many records also include a flight at an altitude of 15,445 metres, over the Andes, albeit with a co-son.
Glk, an ad you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This, in a nutshell, is the last Glk born in the "compact" jews of the star's house, by which Mercedes-Benz attempted to bring a whirlwind of news to this sector.
It is thanks to its unconventional treatment that the unexpected and unconventional communication will accompany the launch of Suv Glk and which will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from the next 17th. October.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which will accompany the new vehicle's debut, will also launch an unofficial method of communication thanks to the futuristic poster's 3D poster campaign, which is used for the first time in Italy for the car brand.
The maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will be dominated by Milan's main business avenue, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of a car in stereoscopic vision and using special glasses that will be distributed in the vicinity of Corsa Como, the new Suv can be seen in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, if you look at the picture, you'll be under the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
Then, using the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be enlightened at different moments in all its trifles to re-compose into a single image.
Mercedes is no doubt trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of automotive communication with this ad.
Will he succeed in attracting the interest of future customers in this way? We'll see.
So now we know who the Italian hooligans are
Trivenetum, risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls who are now ashamed of? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group, which has been following the Nazionale azzurra for years and which, in fact, has never caused excessive problems.
Nor has she ever met the fans of her opponent.
The orientation of the group is right-wing.
The founders are from Triveneto.
Verona, Padua, Trieste e Udine.
In Sofia, they were joined by groups (in fact few groups) from Campania and Puglie.
They have three-color flags on which the descent cities of the people involved: they were removed on Saturday night to avoid being recognized.
They are inspired by the English fans.
They found real Nazi fans in Bulgaria, Levski.
Figc made 144 match tickets available to Italian fans: all in the name, that is, easily controllable.
And Viminale actually checked them all: there was no one with the ongoing Dasle, no one to visit the stadiums in progress, no one who was forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans who had earlier offences from the stadium were denied a ticket and a game banned.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports that come from the Bulgarian police, then take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for five years to at least fans who were arrested or identified during the riots.
The international Daspo, which forbids visiting not only Italian stadiums but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will not set foot in one stadium.
To luck.
But now there is a fear of emulation: this means that more than a hundred and fifty will be joined by others.
"We must immediately extinguish this fire and not justify those who behave in this way," they confirm from Viminal.
So, "harmfully open eyes, mainly for the national match on Wednesday at Lefec."
There is a small core of backers in Puglia.
The Osservatorio will meet tomorrow, the Casms on Tuesday, which can also count on one part of Aise, it is the secret service that takes care of the problems in the stadiums.
"The Chorus Leader-Hand the Enlector and the strained arm during the Mamel's anthem? In Bulgaria, it is not a crime...".
Such is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in a really little happy way), who is the director of Viminal's Osservatorio for a few weeks (he got a job that was formerly Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly the Bursor in Trieste, where the core of the Ultras Italia's backers, founded in 2002, is located.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to glorify the leader, but of course the behaviour of these 150-200 fans is an embarrassment.
"I am not a sociologist - the Osservator number one adds - the crimes are attributed to the country in which they have happened.
So far this group has remained within limits, now let's take a good look at what has happened and we will evaluate for the future.
However, let's also talk about whistling at the Mamel anthem: it's not a crime either, but if you don't mind, it's rude...".
Students victims of expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The leashing market for university students is unfamous for a crisis.
According to the latest researches of Suni, the tenants' union, to rent a single room to a student can cost up to 900 euros in Milan, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"Jev has already reached such proportions that entire sections of students have lost their right to study because of the overall too high prices their families would have to endure – explains the head of the office for the studies of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in this city the students' large demand has distorted the market in such a way that it has spurred the price increase that has swarmed even the residents."
In most cases, the rents offer contain several offences: contracts in a free way, not registered, without limited rent, associated lodgings.
Sunj has an exceptional intervention that could regulate prices thanks to the tax revision.
If we look at the research details, we will see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros per bed, for a single-bed, from the minimum price of 650 (Barta Nerezhez zone) to the mean value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to the maximum 900 (in the Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euro, one room for about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in zones close to the university, it takes 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in single.
In Rome in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros per single room, 450 bed in a double.
The values are a little lower (550 euros for single) zones close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
The only way we'll save is to move to the peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 for the single-bed Drenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples there is a bed of, for example, 300/450 euros for a bed, from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari they want a bed of 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single room.
Prices are definitely lower in smaller cities, but they have more impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where the most common phenomenon is rents for non-European Union students, one more anomaly is finally recorded: an increase of about 25-30% of the charge they want from foreign students, compared to Italian students.
Farewell to the old Paradiso cinema, cities cancel the historic halls
Cinematographic historical halls close in favour of Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas is like blind, it's like a face with no eyes."
The painting, offered by director Giuseppe Tornator, successfully documents what is happening in the city's major city centres, as well as rural towns.
The process of curbing cinemas, the birth of the big multiswatters in the suburbs, and the subsequent demise of monosals in the central areas of cities, is one of the events that seem inevitable and irreversible, but it also has all the hallmarks of true cultural crime.
Often, historical places are disappearing loaded with memories," it's as if we've lost a friend, an acquaintance with whom we shared a long way and a lot of emotion», is felt by the director of the New Cinema, the film that won the Oscar to Tornator and the Grand Jury Prize in Cannes 20 years ago, and who told the poetry of a village cinema and sadness for the way of life that the cinema must have lost forever.
The values obtained by the Ane, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years, the door of 316 cinemas of the traditional tip has closed the door, and the top bill was paid primarily by the halls in the most important cities: 10 fewer in Florence, by 9 in Milan, Naples, by Bohemian and Rome, 6 fewer in Torín, by 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures, Emilia-Romagna is in first place, with the loss of 82 cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, the three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new cinema media: 195 more screenings in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
«The Italian procedure has evolved unspeakably» claims Paolo Protti, President Anecu," is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the already existing ones will survive, because when one cinema closes in the city, not all of its visitors are willing to relocate to the multiplex.
Then let's not even talk about the under-end subsidy for the fund to the operators: the previous national debt is about 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
Support for the sector would require between 16 and 18 million euros per year».
What is interesting is the Bologna case, the first Italian city to worry about the closures and which decided to find a way out by signing the protocula between the village and the Anec, the first of this type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas in both historical centres and in the outskirts.
Among the scheduled standards are the steps of tax breaks in favour of operators and the benefits for the audience in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the zone with limited traffic and have special prices to stop and in some parking lots.
«This initiative I like» says Giuseppe Tornatore"and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures».
However, in order to oppose the great power of the multiplex, traditional halls need to improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more challenging.
The defense of the traditional cinema is a theme that was important forever: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to set up the "New Cinema of the Paradiso" that I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk before the already closed Rialto or Quiril in Nazionale Street, where I shared so much emotion so that I did not have to look at the signs of blackened dust, I turn the other way».
A link between politics and the mafia group 'transaw, Mayor of Gioie Tauro in Prison
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the city's office's election according to the interests of the mafia group Piromalli."
The accusations against the Mafia by the Calabria Directorate against the mayor and vice-president Gioi Tauro Giorgi Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiatone, and the mayor of Rosarno, Carlo Martelli, imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the mafia organization, are tough.
In the handcuffs, Gioacchino Piromalli, an old middleman between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson's lawyer, the namesake of the boss, accused of committing the crimes of a mafia character, convicted of paying 10 million euros.
"Ignored all legal and moral standards as well as common sense," the prosecutors write as two local governments expressed their willingness to pay for consultations to the lawyer, Piromalli.
"That is how they would have allowed the mafia group - the judges write - to officially enter the city's authorities and facilitate the already enormous possibilities of public administration control and management."
The president of the Calabrian regional commission, Agazio Loiero, does not hide the fact that "the secret agreements between local institutions and the organised criminal underworld are a lot in his county: "There are areas where the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others, where collusion is inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians resisting the cope with 'scend, heroes who are still unblemished'.
The imprisonment this morning follows the imprisonment of July last year, by which police showed that the mafia group Piromalli had been hit by the final hit.
Since the end of April of last year - the city council of Gioii Tauro has been disbanded since 1991, the reason for the then-protected link between organised crime and local administration - local politicians have been stripped of their positions in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the leader of the Christian Democrats, who, at the time of the dissolution, was elected head of the right-wing coalition after the closer election in May.
He was screaming about the scandal when Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called to accountable then-Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minniti and accused him of engineering everything for political reasons, but the judges in the imprisonment ordinance signed this morning explain that the mafia group even came to such a point of asking for a change to the A3 motorway project.
Other interrogations ordered against Dal Torrion, the public prosecutors write, came to light "the desire to move the businessman's claims, the representatives of a larger group very close, as is generally known, to Piromalli and to adapt the public administration's choices to the interests of the mafia group."
When the energy is born of the waves, the big ones come into play.
It is an endless deposit that covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface and is now beginning to be discovered by the world's great energy community.
Waves, currents, tides, new sources of inexhaustible energy are on which the eyes of colossus such as Chevron, who now tries to reach out to these sources.
The possibility of creating energy from sea movements has been studied for more than a century, and in the 1970s, in the 1970s, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went away. But now environmental organizations and a new increase in the oil price have given the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) said in London in 2007 that around 15 percent of the world's electricity consumption could be covered by the use of sea wave movements.
this amount would be double the energy currently produced in the nuclear centres.
In addition, there are currents and tides and tides.
The giants are attacking.
the company that bet on marine energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build facilities in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it looked like a huge revolutionary move.
After two years of betting on marine energy, there are more and more companies betting on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
"The masheron is studying ocean energy technology, a spokesman for a company that is linked to the oil colossus of the United States, in the Wall Street Journal's economic daily newspaper, and are thinking about the possibility of working with us."
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission, which is required to launch a project to use marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially considering that it is in Alaska that the US is further harvesting of oil, and President Bush recently came up with a plan for a new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc follows the trail of marine energy. New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey and the sums invested so far, although not known in detail, show increasing interest, according to observers.
Technology, kerou needs to be developed.
Experts talk about the technology that is still in its early stages because it is not known what impact the environmental impact of the use of marine energy will have.
For now, the facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and do not seem to be causing major ecosystem problems.
But for greater energy production, it is necessary to use technologies with a greater impact on the forwarding.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses the system's fears that are linked to each other.
The strength of the waves moving with the buoys up and down is changed with the help of cylinders and cylinders for the hydraulic pressure inside these buoys.
Pressure spins the turbine, which supplies the energy to the generator.
The energy reaches ashore with underwater cables.
For now, four of these types are in the project phase, waiting only for federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for military purposes.
In contrast, Verdant Power already generates power for the mall and the parking lot by using six PDsea turbines in New York's East River.
The movement of the water during the tide causes the turbines to rotate, which feed the generator in this rotating motion.
Verdant commented that they had a long list of clients awaiting the necessary authorization for the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, the tide and the low tide.
Particularly interested at this point in time deserves the potential of tides, the Institute for Electricity Research says.
Although this is a disjointed factor, the tide and tide are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It was in the energy of the tides that nations such as New York, Maine, and Alaska, and other coastal nations, had already invested $7 and a half million in 2008 and predicted investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
