On an emergency call, the professor confessed to shooting his girlfriend
While calling the emergency line, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and it was necessary for them to come to their home.
Lamb vowed to the fact that his "sweet little dog" was alive and probably upset in the house, and that contacts on the family of the dead woman could be found on her phone.
Inside, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message on white office paper: "I'm so sorry, and I wish I could go back, I loved Amy, and she's the only one who ever loved me," read the letter, according to the authorities, signed by Lamb.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles to the school campus where police believe he shot the favorite professor Ethan Schmidt at his office door.
The chief of police at Delta State University, Lynn Buford, said that university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb is said to have made a fatal call to the emergency line shortly afterwards.
In the end, another death came; Lamb had taken his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the school was shot, it forced the students and the faculty to hide behind locked doors, still trying to find out what Lamb's motivation was.
The details released by the state investigators, as well as the students and staff who knew it, jointly created a picture of a talented but probably troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or a violent history.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in the book he wrote in thanks to the "great people" with whom he shared an academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, along with 17 other faculty members, and many students took courses at both at the same time.
There were also inclinations in terms of problems.
The student who praised Lambo, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaky, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him that he was facing stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for leave on medical grounds, stating that it had a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes to the recruitment of university staff meant that a doctorate in which Lamb worked hard would not guarantee him an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lambo seemed to be troubled by something."
These questions will no longer be answered by Lamb.
After leaving the campus, police picked up his trail as he crossed the border of the state of Arkansas back to Misissippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single shot from a gun in the yard of the house about a mile from his parents in the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington State Coroner General, Methel Johnson, confirmed.
He left the car on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb had gone to this house, though Johnson had said he probably knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in this region.
Lamb began working at the University, which has 3,500 students in the city, which has a population of about 1,2000 people, in 2009 and taught geography and education classes.
He received his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic, and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met through their shared friends.
She was with her friends in high school, and he was the great older kid who tutored her guitar to play guitar for several years.
He was quite a heartbreaker at the time.
The heart of all the girls softened as soon as it appeared," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the outskirts of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss reportedly dated for a while.
During the emergency phone call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named the Lightning that lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the shoulder of the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was fine.
Ex-husband Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they separated 15 years ago, but they stayed friends and had a daughter, now 19 years old.
"She was completely slumped," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She was best friends with her mother.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail, he knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss when he and Abigail tracked down at the Summer Festival three years ago.
They later played random gigs together.
O'Steen said that his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, the bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a sleeper-lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamba and Prentiss on the night of September 5, the pot that Lamb had finished his guitar and accordion for a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"They were just a happy couple," he said.
We lached and recorded each other on a joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the slain professor, ran a first-year seminar and specialized in original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the Boys' Student Club and the reign of students.
At the Cleveland Florida State campus on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, staff, students, and community members, attended a candlelight commemorative event.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended a vigie during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The school started again on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge says.
The crisis is over.
This is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
The writers for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to the report.
This story was edited to reflect the fact that police now claim that Lamb made a call to the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us claims not to have as many seasonal workers as they did last year, but the maker of children's toys and products says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also said it planned to hire about 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, a decline from 45,000 last season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company claims to start recruiting the bidders this month and will recruit staff during October until December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily hire employees to help out at stores and sales, for the dispatch and delivery of the goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'date' with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the arrival of the royal family when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would be sitting there," he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in time."
The film begins and I realize I'm at the top of what you might call a fake date with the Princess of Wales.
"Return in time," is a documentary about "Return to the Future," which states interviews with Fox, Leo Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of "Back for the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said: "This is truly, admittedly, the best travel document for me that has ever been filmed."
"Retur Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that there is "no military solution" to the conflict of nearly five years, and more weapons will only worsen the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unify and support for inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent councils of the countries - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and among the Syrian people and regional powers "did the situation be insoluble."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they showed when reaching an Iranian nuclear deal in addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 poll numbers that show that Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to label him as a man who often changes his mind.
The others waved their hands like a flawed joke.
And some are preparing for the implosion.
But whether some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they are failing (yet).
10 of the last 11 national polls show that Donald Trump is in charge for a double-digit number, and some people are beginning to ask seriously what this real estate magnate's nomination chances means.
Of course, it is yet the start of the electoral cycle.
None of this says that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time of 2011, the leadership of Rick Perry made the path to the rise of Herman Caine, and in the end neither of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he could run into the general election.
But outside groups like Jeba Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are aware of Trump's will to endure and are starting to unload their dollars at a stand in order to overthrow him.
Here are some recent voting numbers that suggest that a real estate mogul is not just a passing phase:
Trump's ratings for favorability were reversed by 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University vote showed that only two of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of this realtor's magnate.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six of the 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
Roughly three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers stick to them in the early stages.
Following the Quinnipiac University vote last week, it was found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthistered" or "satisfied" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be "split" from his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "enthriggered" against the 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Other closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "discomfort" or "disturbed" if the favorite of Jeb Bush became a candidate.
Most Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pomposity and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters are nationwide in favor of the idea that the real estate mosque has the right temperament for the presidency, according to a ABC News/Washington Post vote on Monday.
The same number is held in the Iowa senatorial club, which is the first in the country, where 52 percent of Republicans think they have a commander's personality, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have a personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 of the 10 independents say his temperament doesn't belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
Asked who would most likely win the GOP nomination, four of them said that Trump would be the best option, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
This is a change in late July, when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.
Full publication: GOP voters have not had the brightest crystal ball in the past.
At the time of the previous cycle, 4 of the 10 Republicans selected Rick Perry as the winner of the candidacy against 28 percent for the eventual nomination of Mitt Romney.
Yet it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as credible.
Even as Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump is still beating almost everyone.
Some scholars emphasize that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trumpov support is diffuse-tuned among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical direct contest between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always win majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally by Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christio by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead the dealer by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one match.
A bald majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've already made up their minds.
A new Tuesday's CBS/NYT poll shows that only more than half of the voters supporting Trump say they will not change their minds.
It's obvious that a lot of things can change that, and no one can really say that they would never change their minds.
46 percent say they keep their back door open for a change between the candidates.
Still, Trump's current strongest opponent is his outsider associate neurosurgeon, Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion to be final would be twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 of the 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called Mexico's immigrants "hublished rape" in his campaign's announcement speech, immigration has continued to be the main and central theme of the 2016 conversation.
Some fear that Trump's pomposity will draw key Hispanic voters away from the Republican party and damage the pursuit of rebranding.
But according to a new ABC/Post Monday poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the topic of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain, too.
Frustration from the government reaches new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now receiving about half of the support from Republican voters, especially given their state of outsiders.
Six of the 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post vote on Monday say they prefer a political outsider to someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry with Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Voting in Iowa revealed a few weeks ago that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were frustrated with Republicans in Congress, 54 percent were "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "hellly angry."
The House supported the state's larger share of the coal fees.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
At first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported the government's amendment to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of the fee for the land-based suction-cornerment of the mining company.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised MPs that both the state treasury and the budgets of municipalities would receive extra money as a result.
The draft was criticized by opposition MPs, who fear that mining firms will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have done so far because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House supported the government's amendment to the Mining Act at first reading, which means, among other things, that the state should receive a larger part of the revenue from the mining company's extraction fees.
The state's share will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will be reduced from 75 percent to 33 percent.
The draft also changes the way the remuneration for the minerals that the companies extract.
The change in mineral mining fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenues of the municipalities' budgets are to have a neutral impact because the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year, municipalities received roughly CZK 450 million of the fees and the state budget of CZK 150 million.
The mining of brown coal was worth about 200 million crowns to the municipalities and the state to the state of CZK 66 million.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the remuneration from the mining premises with the permitted mining to CZK 1,000 per hectare per year.
The receipt of these reimbursements is to continue to be fully owned by the municipalities.
Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that this would give municipalities a year instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
Revenue is newly calculated as the product of the amount of the extracted mineral and the rates for each type of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
But ODS MEP Marek Benda warned against the fact that the setting of the fee by government decree may not be in line with the constitution.
According to the Minister Mládek, however, this is not a tax, because the state charges the mineral, which is state property.
The fees are received only by municipalities whose territory is affected by the mining.
In the case of deep-sea coal, three-quarters of the municipality's money and a quarter will be given to the state.
The same ratio will be for the extraction of radioactive rock.
Some of the money the state will collect in the mining fees will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after the extraction or to provide the Mining Rescue Service.
The draft was criticised by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that they would harm the municipalities affected by the mining and the regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have done so far, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to have the Finance Minister improve his budget," said David Kádner (Dawn) chosen in the Ústí Region.
Ahead of the rise in unemployment in Most, KSČM MEP Hana Aulická warned.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kucera wanted to return the law to the government for completion.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to mining firms, the fee increase will not be reflected in the price of coal, as prices are more than 90 percent contracted for the long term.
So major consumers like power plants or heating plants should not feel the rise in prices.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in reimbursements by seeking to reduce their operating expenses, which would mean a reduction in the number of employees in the first place," the government admits.
However, according to her, the increase in fees in terms of employment is bearable.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that MPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining.
If coal is mined beyond limits, then it will have impacts on revenues for both the state and the municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with the Met that the decision to break the limit at the mine of the Czechoslovak Army should not be made until after 2020.
The limits at the CSA mine should be breached for social, economic reasons, and for the long-term stability of domestic energy.
Vesely will lead the Czechs as the number one, the deployment will be affected by the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear on the board at Thursday's draw for the Davis Cup draw in India, and this time each of them is likely to hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navratil plans to break down the load over the quartet, given the difficult conditions.
It is hot and high humidity in Delhi, so challenging matches are expected to stretch to five sets.
We have to take that into account.
I'd like to spread it out on the weather.
And depending on how it will look, said Navratil during today's training of the Czech selection at the centre of Raj Kumar Khánna.
With the team's number one and the world's 40, Jiří Veselý, he is counting on Friday and Sunday's singles.
The position of number two is likely to be Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek.
I'd like almost everyone to get involved.
It's slow in my head, but I'm not saying it yet, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech line-up should be Štěpánek's participation in Saturday's doubles.
It is just a question of who will stand next to the experienced debat player, who has a record of 18:4 in the Davis Cup in the doubles.
It's not going to be cheerful.
There are options with Rosol, or Adam Pavlasek.
"I really don't know who with whom and what it will look like," said Navratil.
It will be based on the development of the doubles.
Pavlasek may be a variant, with Vesely surprised in the first round with a win in the doubles over the Australians.
"He is in the doubles respectable way," said Navratil.
I did it against Australia, and if I play, I'd like to perform the same performance I've shown there since the second set.
"I am happy for the experience and I would like to bring a point," Pavlasek said.
The home side will deploy Yuki Bhambri (255th in the ATP rankings) in the doubles, having won last week's Challenger in Shanghai, where he beat the third and fourth-ranked players.
The number two will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
They are both Challenger players and ours have experience in the ATP Tour, but we have convinced ourselves many times that the rankings in the Davis Cup do not make the difference.
"It's the current form that decides, the weather," said Navratil.
Friday's opening singles will start at 6:30 GMT and can stretch out because of the weather.
The forecast is to rain and the court is not under the roof.
However, the game can be played under artificial lighting.
They've already lit it up, and it's got some two thousand lux, which is enough.
"It should be put to be played under the lights," said Navratil.
Jeremy Corbyn to debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut in the PMQ is expected very enthusiastically
New working manager Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and will work with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six committed questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be carefully examined by the media and by MPs.
In a week's statement, he asked for "less theatres and more facts."
He also said he could skip the few sessions he would leave for his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corby's leadership, which comes after his appointment to the Shadow Cabinet and his speech to the TUC's annual Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to become quietly during the singing of the national anthem on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has been met with criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and is the focus of attention on several stories on the front pages of the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
Mr. Corbyn's spokesman said he'd "frush in respect of silence" and that he would recognize "the heroism of the Royal Airships in the Battle of Britain."
However, Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet member, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight programme that he would recommend to the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr. Corbyn's top team, quoting differences in the economy, defense and foreign affairs, and only a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as a leader.
The BBC's political correspondent, Robin Brant, says that the political differences in the work are also "supplied" after the appointment of Mr Corbyn through his position in the European Union and the government's benefit limit.
Mr. Corbyl said at the TUC conference that the Workers' Party had put forward amended proposals to remove the entire idea of the benefit limit.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the secretary of the shadow work and pensions, said that the party had "very clearly" opposed the government's plans to reduce the cap from £226 to £2233,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Workers' Party, faced by David Cameron in the last decade since his election as Conservative leader.
The leader of the working party, who promised a different approach to politics, says he has "out of the crowd" ideas to question Mr Cameron and have received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North argues that the PMQ is too confrontational and that they will refrain from both "shot responses" and toothless commerce, promising instead to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn argues that Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secretary, will represent him at the PMQ when he does not attend-such as when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also dismissed the idea of letting other colleagues get out for him from time to time, for he was heard to have discussed the matter with House Speaker John Bercow.
When Mr. Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" policy style, which was often associated with the PMQ but admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since their first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of the leaders' judgment, their leadership of the House and their position among other MPs, even though the critics have argued that they have become a caricature and far-reaching reforms are needed.
"Fatty in Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
But a group of former street kids found a way to learn something and make a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a nonprofit studio that teaches young homeless people to take photographs of their neighborhoods and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

Pound rises as pay rises in the UK to accelerate
The pound jumped in the following dates and showed the recovery of Britain's wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was driven above with the SABMiller bidding target.
Between May and June, the profits of GB, including bonuses, rose 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest since 2009, and it looked as if the estimates of when rates would rise were getting closer.
Sterling was climbing more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was down 0.84% on the euro at €11.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock on the market and jumped by 20% after receiving an approach to the bid from its rival, AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and the approach of brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were up 0.9% after encouraging news from rival luxury merchandise group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.
Shares in Glencore rose by 5% after the mining giant said they had risen by $2.5bn using shared placement as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Stocks in the Packing and Paper Group Mondi were the biggest drop in the index and down by 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs downgraded his rating to the company for "sale."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sports company announced an 83% jump in the middle of the year in pre-tax profits of £46.6m
JD Sports chief says higher wages could hurt expansion
Executive Chairman of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that purchasing power will outweigh the higher wage costs at his company, he says.
The costs could be hit by plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of the Prague apartment building marshmallow are cheering.
The controversial structure got a stop sign.
The investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.
Hundreds of people protested against the construction, which is to be created in close proximity to the St. Ages Monastery in the centre of Prague 1, a petition was also created.
The Municipality stated in the decision that the building code had been violated because not all the formalities of the zoning decision had been respected.
"The zoning decision in question does not contain some of the elements, such as the type of land, the distance from neighbouring buildings, the sufficiently clearly and comprehensibly described the shape of the building, the demarcation of the territory concerned by the construction," his decision reads.
The magistrate also considers it illegal to consider that some of the documents for the decision were issued for the documentation currently under file, which has changed.
These include the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the construction is to be created on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid approval.
The dossier shows, however, that this only evidenced the landowner's consent to the project documentation for the zoning management, not the consent to the placement of the construction on his land, writes the Building Regulations Department.
According to Francesco Augustus Razett of the investor firm, the Building Regulations Department did not take note of the decision of the superior body - the Ministry of Regional Development, according to which the deadline for the initiation of the review had already expired.
Anyway, this is a scandalous approach.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, abiding by all laws of the Czech Republic and respecting all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which people dubbed a marshmallow for the coate's supposedly designed color of the facade, evokes strong emotions in Prague.
Hundreds of people have gathered in the city centre in the past to protest the construction.
Associations and residents of nearby houses resent the fact that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the inappropriateness of the building for the historical centre of Prague and the immediate neighbourhood of the Anežna Monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project was changed several times.
The original form of the 2008 project, which envisaged a glass facade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Heritage Institute (NPÚ) and revoked the Prague Monuments' Authorisation in 2010.
The new project by Praga Progetti e Investimenti with face-shaped windows was approved by the NPÚ and the Municipal Monuments and a building permit was issued on this basis.
The author of the proposal rejects the criticisms of the opponents, saying he never counted on the façade in pink, which gave the project the nickname after the pink and white-and-white confectionery.
The Czech politician gave the migrants a ride.
The Hungarians put him and them in the bass.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to the refugees.
On the way, he and the crew took three Syrian refugees to the car, who he said they wanted to climb for about half a kilometer.
He said it was not yet criminal in Hungary, he told Lidové noviny.
We knew the law enforcement officers were not in this kind of conduct.
But when the officers stopped us, to our surprise, we were arrested and taken to pre-trial detention in Szezeged, he described the paper.
The politician ended up spending nine hours in the cell.
The police were said to be correct, but communication was slow because they did not speak English very well.
But the prison, he said, was trite.
For example, in our cell measuring about three by four metres, 15 refugees from Syria were crowded.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were locked up there for the next day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what would happen to them next, Berg said.

Metcash launches campaigning in the country to fight the invasion of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches campaigning in the country to fight the invasion of Aldi
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in southern and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relations with local food suppliers and are building the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers are joining with brands such as Dunsborough, based on the Lasborough ice cream maker, offering tastings at IGA stores, and store owners selling discounted tickets to the Australian Football League to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, with food, alcohol and hardware retailer celebrating its annual investor strategic day.
There is a lot of stakes at stake because in southern and western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA trade steps and generate a higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in southern and Western Australia are notoriously provincial, and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in the SA and 24 percent in the WA compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
In any case, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will face 5 percent of the food market in the two states in the 12 months since the first stores opened, which took over sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers, to open.
This week, in a report by Morgan Stanley, analyst Tom Kierath, estimated that the IGA retailer could lose USD 360 million in annual sales and Metcash of USD 250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the Western for the next year, and will generate sales of $500 and $600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes at the fixed price base of Metcash could cost it around USD 13 million in pre-tax revenue, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although the latest Roy Morgan survey found that shoppers at IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks that food sales of Metcash will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will be reduced from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the fund's managing director, Hamish Douglass, founder of the financial group Magellan, said business lunches in Melbourne could "highly disappear over the decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Douglass's comment.
But it is known that Metcash board member contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and food sales earnings from the Metcash, which supplies about 1,200 retailers to IGA, have fallen by 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting the operating developments in the change in speculation as sales and yields are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler has gone on a counter-attack and invests more than $150 million a year to compare the counter prices in Coles and Woolworths to hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers reunite by adding fast-growing food and innovations from private citizens.
Metcash's CEO, Ian Morrice, says that price-computing and store retrofitting programs will catch on grabs and hope that the wholesaler will return to the basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame for his behavior, rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis became a minor loss in a recent fuss over his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise for his behavior rather than criticism, says President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," drew unwelcome attention thanks to an affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, had to be separated twice by the referee, Harrison said afterwards: 'Wawrinka should have drawn one to Kyrgios and I was to draw for him as well.'
While he was last seen breaking his racket after a cramp derailed by Richard Gasquet's possible US-Opsen, Kokkinakis steadfastly defended Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he is competing with Sam Groroth for a second singles appearance behind Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semifinals against Britain.
"I have been thinking quite intensely about the fact that in my opinion Thanas was a little drawn into the whole dispute," Healy says.
He destroyed his racket when he lost for a spasm in the US, but he is not the first player to take out his racket's rage because of the frustration. I know Thanasi well enough, and I can tell he's not going to be proud of this event.
But he was in serious control of himself very well, because he was subjected to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves a lot of credit.
He has a fantastic team around him, he also has a great family around him and I think he was treated with a bit of a hard time.
He is a very adult 19-year-old man, he works very hard and fits into the team great and so on, he never had a problem with other players, he is very respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he is in an amazing condition, he is a very stable and mature young boy and I simply think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgios for an important game, which starts on Friday, and says that a "mutual decision" is the right solution for all, but supports the Canberra native to return to the team as a long-term standout.
"First of all, we want our team to be totally focused on the game and not all the controversy that has arisen around him [Kyrgios].
And I think Nick was climbing very fast, as Federer, Murray and other people point out, growing rapidly in the public eye, making a few terrible mistakes, and deserving of all the criticism he receives, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time out of the limelight when he will be able to think about it is, in my opinion, the best solution for the team and also for himself.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Following the state of emergency, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, detaining those who attempted to cross it illegally to halt the flow of migrants.
Chaos arose at the border, while hundreds of migrants piled up in a no-man's-land, and Serbian authorities reacted with outrage.
Those who are stuck on the traps of the country between two states are those who flee from violence in their native countries and take up residence for themselves.
But here comes feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter passes over them, the migrants together call "Open the border!" and berate the Hungarian police riot squad.
Some reject food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister declares it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more of them are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not just indirect harm.
Over the next few days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-state bloc did not come up with a unified immigration policy for the ongoing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 people seeking protection in the surprised Italy and Greece and spoke with the hope of reaching an eventual agreement for the next month or at the end of the year, which the EU nations would accept more than 120,000 other refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened a special EU European summit for a week on Tuesday to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
Nevertheless, Hungary did not cling to Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave the authorities more power to address the crisis and allowed them to close roads and speed up court cases for asylum.
Meanwhile, Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said his country also planned to build a barbed-wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country now that the fence on the Serbian border is now completed.
CBS News Corpoonment Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who helped to stretch the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point to the European Union for Refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who go for a better life and not for protections seeking protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU states, including Germany.
New laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalise the violation of the 4 metre fence that the government had built on the southern border with Serbia, as well as to establish longer prison terms for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by the mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs in the southern city of Szeged told reporters.
We are very clear about this: the illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Technically, the parliament must still approve the deployment of the army, which was expected in the next week, but Associated Press reporters on the border have watched the heavily armed army with vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, an adviser to Orban for home defence, said the authorities were caught by 45 people who tried to cross the border and caught 15 already in the national territory.
They were inflicted by fence damage and are now charged in police custody with committing offences under new law.
The authorities quickly had the fence repaired.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a towing truck covered with barbed wire.
The main border crossing at Roszke arose in chaos, as the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container for processing and a crowd of people was created.
About 20 of them fit in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders down by half in national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (incremented 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is yet to announce whether he will want to become president, has been receiving support from 15 percent of the Democratic primary electorate.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic voters say it is too early to say that they are clearly a decision to support the candidate.
But the Clinton sponsors are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News poll, Clinton has lost ground in several demographic groups, while Sanders has won several.
Clinton maintains a big lead between women and easing, but her leadership is narrowing.
Her support among the men has been significantly reduced and Sanders loses only 5 points to it.
Clinton's advantage with Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated and now she and Sanders are equal.
But Clinton still has a big leadership thanks to the older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Sanders among the Liberals, but now Sanders loses only 5 points to her in that group.
About half of the Democratic primary voters across the nation say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party's nominee.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support it only because it is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
It's probably not surprising that Clinton's current inculcate is particularly keen on her.
Views are mixed among those that do not support Clinton at the moment - only about a quarter would be enthusiastically supportive.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked about why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), the time is that it's time for a woman to be president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It is also quoted as a great possibility of election and a match on problems.
While the vice president is considering a potential nomination for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to be in the face - a third think he shouldn't run.
When primary democratic voters were asked who they would select as the second ballot for the party's nomination, the most common choice is Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half of Biden's second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden runs, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the best chance to win the general election; but that figure fell from 78 percent of last month.
Biden is far from second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as most likely to be the most likely to be elevable are increasing.
However, when it came to the question of the candidate's greater importance, Democratic voters prefer to solve problems over a greater chance to be elected.
Like last month, neither Democratic candidate or potential candidate emerges as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have had good results in some of the key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Most see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as sincere and trustworthy, and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden leads in honesty of all three, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, or twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have that opinion about him.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders, and Biden are in line with their ideological view.
As for all these standards, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and server as secretary of state, continue, most of the primary Democratic electorate is satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that their overall view of her did not affect her at all.
But it's a different story among the American public.
Half of the Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public's view of the subject was divided in March, shortly after the problem emerged.
Most Americans argue that this email controversy has no bearing on their overall view of Clinton, while 36 percent have worsened their opinion of Clinton.
It is mainly Republicans, where more than 6 of the 10 claim that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy among her party's voters, the issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, a drop of eight points from last month, and by 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not think she is honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not see Trump as honest and trustworthy either.
But both Clinton and Trump are well grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush did the best perform in honesty.
Sanders see more people as honest than dishonest, but, as with Carson, a lot of voters didn't make an opinion about him.
The error spanner for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percent points.
Ben Carson quits Donald Trump in national election
Ben Carson gets closer to Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates are responsible for half of the electorate in the latest poll, and others are getting support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump by an overwhelming majority, climbing from 23% of support in the latest CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well across demographic groups, and eliminates Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carla Fiorin and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is behind, together with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, fell to the current 2% on the gallery.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all together in third place with 6%.
The error margin for a sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest poll is plus or minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week, showed that Carson improved and reached 19% of Republican support for 32% of Trump's support.
The latest poll by ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is well ahead of Carson.
On the upward trend of Carson, Trump decided to shoot blind at a retired neurochirurge, and even to Carson apologized for the interrogation over Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said during the Iowa campaign last Saturday.
Five members of the fraternity accused of the death of first-year student Baruch College
Almost two years after the student died during the overburden fraternal ritual at the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, a murder charge was filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Dogs brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the ceremony opening in September 2013 and was taken to the hospital by the late, which contributed to his death, police reported.
The officers say he was blindfolded, wearing a backpack full of sand weighing £30, and was repeatedly harassed when he tried to reach the target through the frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of Pi Delta Psi fraternal did not call 911 immediately after Deng fainted and reportedly waited an hour to get taken to the hospital, police say.
However, they found time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the fraternity, and asked for advice, police chief Chris Marked at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide the equipment and basically preferred the well-being of fraternity to the life of Michael Deng," said Chief Wagner.
He was unable to be revived and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck by a blunt force on the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated as a result of overburdening in fraternity, and at least one student dies every year for overburdening since 1970," writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, in a statement.
The brotherhood and their members must be responsible, and this is an important step by the authorities.
Monroe County's grand jury has recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault with overburdening and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to detain not only the persons involved, but in the event that there is an organisation that approved it, either officially or unofficially, we will hold them accountable as well," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood, and the national fraternity revoked its relationship with the local branches.
This is what tents when the Fed raises interest rates
Rate rises will come and the bull market will stumble, with bond yields rising and the economy will slide into recession.
We know all of this.
What we don't know is how much time it takes and how long it takes.
For the economy, specifically, the history of the short-lighter offers the timing of the timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted for 86 months.
The aggarsivity of the Federal Reserve in rate hikes is often, though not always, decisive in how the economy and financial assets will react.
This is why US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when rate hikes will begin, but rather trajectories, how long it will take to normalisation.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, eventually, market members can make sure that all the uproar for speeding increases can be exaggerated.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the 'cheap money era,'" Julian Jessop, the global economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to a more common but still low one to create a seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen over the last month or so, the expected rate hikes may make the air a little unstable.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend for a re-stamping stock after 12-24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect the monetary policy lag," analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed's increase.
More specifically, the market in the last 35 years or often most - about 14 percent - is heading for a rate hike in the relatively flat in 250 days (average gain of 2.6 percent), and then returns to normal after 500 days, with an average yield from the last six cycles 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the company's main equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said the impact on the stock was tending to become more pronounced later in the rate hikes cycle and the return was starting to decline.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but raising rates often helps it.
Currently, the Fed is facing some conditions that have not yet existed and could hasten a recession.
The most notable thing is that the gross domestic product close to its lowest point in history in the Fed's hike in the Fed's rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 rate hikes since 190, only the two-fold nominal year-on-year GDP increase below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few expect it to be maintained when it was at just 1.5 percent in the third quarter, reports the Fed.
Raising rates in this complex economic background could be risky and the question could arise "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants were prepared for the Fed's growth all year round, and all eyes turned to the Federal Free Market Committee meeting this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, future trading indicates a 25 percent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the increasing cycles so far in a super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP, obscuring the peaks of the early recession very quickly after the incipient recovery," the report reads.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest of those when the Fed has been waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are at 74 months and we are still on.
The firm return was also volatile, as the market expects a rate hike and the model is somewhat similar to what the shares are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more noticeable for bonds than for equities when the Fed changes policy direction.
Bonds appear to be changing the yields in the direction as soon as the first time the increase/lowing cycle is first.
At the end of the cycle, increases in bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rate hike will cause yields to be approached between long-time and short-date bonds, which will match the curve.
Bonds with high yields often work better in this climate, although "we are still cautious about the straining of the proceeds," Kathy Jones, a fixed-term fixation analyst at Schwab, said in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets are already tailored to Fed policy expectations.
"Apart from the strength of the dollar and a decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the outlook for stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, the credit spread has expanded and volatility has increased - all market characteristics as the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that do most of their business in the US will win interest rates when they rise, and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will be doing worse, because the dollar growing will make their products more expensive in the world market, and their debt will also be greater.
"History shows that the "quality" of shares tends to override itself within three months of the initial rate hike," Goldman Sachsve analysts said in a client report.
Companies with strong balance sheets overturned the weak balance sheet companies in each interest rate increase in 1994, 1999, 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital earnings, as well as low volatility stocks, also surpassed their lower-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of mobile interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure equity games, consumers are also benefiting thanks to the growing dollar.
Savingsmen can also see their profits through higher returns, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized this station for 'fooling'
He takes the view that he is increasingly indistinguishable from his commercial opponent
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they just cheat on the British
Senior colleague Damien Collins attacked the Voice and says even he is not an original idea
BBC Radio 3 is "changed" at the Classic FM, the leading MP says, and is mounting fresh pressure on the broadcast to show that they are doing something that commercial broadcasts are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC's chiefs that the public service radio station appeared to be "unlumphed" and becoming increasingly indistinctable from its business rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "fooled "- but it seems to be changing to the Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, appear to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that come to mind when you're actually just imitating what we already have in the market," Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC's director-general rejected the allegations on the grounds that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its trade rival for live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I would not learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to live music and make music is actually at the top level.
"I also think that the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is also very important," he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to engage in the audience than before, because the British are less educated in terms of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC's production to come under fire for trekking at the heels of commercial competitors during the broadcasts of Kultura, Media and Sport and got to the commission's hearing.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a music talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talp Media for an estimated price of £22 million.
Do you see why this programme is being discussed as unoriginal and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which stars Paloma Faith and the George star George shine - was made "in a BBC-talker-take-themed way."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "found a hit from its own stable" if it starts a fun series next time.
However, he refused to rule out ordering multiple future series of The Voice or spending the money of the royalty fee for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales are growing at the slowest pace since August and Black Friday may be to blame
For the first three months of 2015, they recorded a 7% increase in online sales
Last month saw the lowest growth since the records themselves began in 2000
Internet sales were boosted three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that Black Friday in November could be the reason for the braking of spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, making many of Britain's main streets a city of ghosts.
However, experts say there are signs of stabilisation of online sales, and the new data shows a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August was the lowest increase in growth since the 2000 measurement starts, with an increase of just 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts say there are signs of stabilisation of online sales, and new figures show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the level of growth over the past few years and go back to 2000, the condition has always become more rationalized over time," says Andy Mulcahy, IMRG's sales index index editor, for the Guardian.
It explains that online sales were boosted three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now (growth) is somewhat stagnating, and therefore it seems to be subsiding.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was taken over from the Americas, is cited as one of the reasons for the drop in sales.
Experts believe customers could be busy shopping before the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
In the past year, five times more than the average of shoppers turned to their computers to make purchases and to drop several of the retailers' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which shoppers are hiring again, can withhold customers from other purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of every £5 was spent online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in brick-and-mortar fashion stores.
Muslims bury victims of crane crash in Mecca and family Bin Laden sanctioned
Body of 29 dead was carried over by the streets of Muslims in the performance of the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse of the structural tycoon Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims have gathered to bury the 29 victims of the crane crash at the Grand mosque in Mecca. The bodies of the victims were carried down the street.
Dressed to some extent in white, the grieves had chosen their way and paid their respects to the victims as the first of the fallen made their final trip to the cemetery in Al-Moaissem.
The sad message passed the holy place, where only a few days earlier the construction crane had broken through the mosque's ceiling and overthrew to the faithful.
The bodies were released for the funeral, and the Saudi king sanctioned the bin Laden family's construction group at the disaster, which was also abandoned by 394 of the injured.
The bodies of 29 dead after the crane crash in the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried by the streets
Among the dead were the father of the four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, the Greater Machester, who was at his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Haj Haj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already promised that the snake to Mecca will take place and thousands of people continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that the Binadin Group should not have left the arm of the crane at the top when it was not in operation.
The Arab version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi press agency, states that the Binladin Group is partly to blame for the fall.
The English disks agency service did not report this detail, but said that the company's bosses were banned from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims are metalling before the Hadzlonine pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group did not issue any statement of the collapse of the crane and was not available to his representatives for comment.
The royal decrees also charged the group for not using the latest security measures, and a lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort headed by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling families for decades and have run major construction projects.
Al-Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden, was the son of a renegade whom the family renounced in the 1990s.
The crash happened in the midst of strong winds and rain just days before the delivery of millions of people in the kingdom at a fair that every able-bear Muslim must make at least once in his life.
Officials say that 158 people remain in the hospital.
Officials determined that one million riyals ($174,000) will be donated to relatives of the killed, and the same amount for the permanently injured.
The other injuries will receive half of this amount.
B&Q chief says Eastern European traders working cheaply are already down the trend
Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laurya
The number of trader trained traders from Eastern Europe is at the growth point
The result is an open 200 Screwfix deals targeting traders
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Processed by Rupert Steiner, the main correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to be putting off hammers and brushes and handing them over to employed trained Eastern European craftsmen to work at their home
If you're good with a hammer or a paint brush, you seem to be in the minority today.
As the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to do DIY work at their home, according to the company's chief executive, behind Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, Kingfisher's new managing director, who owns a chain for home use, argues that a large increase in the number of trainees taught in Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores targeting merchants, and is closing 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms. Laury says she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions at the store are made by the better half.
Currently, most of the male workers are.
She said there was a need to address the growing demographic trends that depict more women's households, which make more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Ms. Laura says, "Still in our shops, it's mostly men's.
We need to get closer to balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women who make 80% of the decisions about the purchase of goods.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of leading companies under the British FTSE100 index, also re-structured her top-of-the-range team to reflect the equivalence between male and female directors.
Kingfisher is almost alone in having half the representation of women among staff, including the executive and finance director.
Ms Laury says: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
So it wasn't difficult to find the good women to take to us.
Kingfisher announced a slump in both profit and sales profit and sales after the group took the cost of closing the deals.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
The December contribution of CZK 600 to pensioners is in jeopardy.
"It is the justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said TOP 09 Vice-President Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasized the principle of merit.
ODS deputy chairman Zbyněk Stanjura noted that while the one-off contribution sounds good, it would be better in the long run to be standard indexed because it would be reflected in the years to come.
"We have room to find the mechanism by which we will arrange it," said Stanjura.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marksová (ČSSD), according to which it was to be indexed to the above the law next year.
Marks defended the subsidy by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she said was not rosy.
The higher indexation of next year, she said, would mean a budget impact of 5.5 billion crowns, and ministers are debating every hundred-million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right that it has reduced the pace of indexation in the past.
The rapporteur, Miroslav Opálka (KSČM), pointed out that the proposal did not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
The right-wing's veto will make the payday's paycheck much more difficult in December, and it may even make it impossible, he said.
The chairman of the ČSSD deputies, Roman Sklenák, therefore proposed a reduction in the deadline for discussing the standard in the committee to ten or 20 days, which was blocked by the right.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should cost the total cost of CZK 1.73 billion.
The money is to come mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Next year, pensions should rise by an average of about a penny.
The allowance should be given to the pension amendment by people who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December.
It could also be obtained by those who lost their pension in December before paying it.
But they would have to ask for a surcharge in writing by the end of next year at the latest.
Pensions are indexed to the Czech Republic on a regular basis for January, by price growth and a third of real wage growth.
This year, the pension is equivalent to a 41.5 percent gross wage, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
The state spent CZK 314.7 billion on old-age pensions last year, according to the state's closing account, which was roughly five billion more year-on-year.
Spending on old-age pensions accounted for 26 percent of all budget expenditure and 46 percent of all statutory expenses.
The average full old-age pension rose by CZK 104 to CZK 10,714, according to data in the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and some 17,000 relative pensions.
Yakunin has abandoned his plans for a political career, he will pursue science.
The Senate seat was almost assured, according to Russian media.
In the Federation Council, he was to represent the Western Russia's Kaliningrad region, whose governor, Nikolai Tukanov, as the candidate of the governing United Russia party, defended his post in Sunday's election.
Under Russian law, senators are not elected by the citizens, but are chosen by the governor from a trio of candidates whose names he announce before the gubernatorial elections.
After the election, he selects the senator from the trio of candidates.
The complication for Yakunin was the fact that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad region for twenty years, as required by law.
The Kremlin has found an exemption for Yakunin, saying he is an extraordinary and plenipotentiary ambassador who is not covered by the statutory long-term residence requirement.
The filming of the Czech comedy The Theory of the Tiger has come to an end.
The final drop in the main character's resolution is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has run out of strength and patience.
Grandmother - Iva Janžurová decided on her grandfather's life, old age and funeral.
It is clear to John that he and his wife Olga - Eliška Balzerová are on a similar journey.
He remembers that he once had dreams of his own will, and he wanted to live with dignity and freedom.
He is eager to regain control of his life - and as a solution he chooses to escape from it so far, Nightingale said.
Bajgar wanted to capture a comedic type of relationship in which one of the partners did not feel entirely free.
From the start, he said, it was clear that the leading roles would go to Bartošek, with whom he had already collaborated on the series Invisible.
Yet the actor, who appeared in front of the camera after a lengthy break associated with the recovery after a serious illness, surprised him.
We agreed to do so three years ago.
I had him read the script, and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I was surprised he was obviously a cocooned athlete.
In the past, he always asked another scene before filming where he would sit.
This time he rode his bike, climbed rocks and even went uphill.
And all in the record tropical heat, the director pointed out.
According to Bartoška, the women are taking the tiger to make it a rabbit over time.
They'll put some feed on him, but they'll close the gate right away so it doesn't accidentally think of playing the tiger crabber.
And that's what we're trying to tell our film about, the actor commented.
His wife, who may be a little negative for the audience, was portrayed by Eliška Balzerová.
She's not just a negative character.
She's also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic, and she means well.
But she is also a usurper and wants to bake her husband to death, Bajgar said.
The film also depicts the fates of John's married daughters Olinka and Alice - Tanya Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and sons-in-law of Erik and Pepík - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The film's producer is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producer Czech Television and Radio and Televizia Slovakia.
Google promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
Google, an American internet company, has promised to provide up to $5.5 million ($132.6 million) to organizations that help thousands of refugees pouring into Europe.
This was announced on Tuesday by Google.org, a charity offshoot of the internet company.
Azerbaijan canceled Teliček's part of the visit for criticizing human rights violations.
Czech MEP for the ANO movement Pavel Telička postponed Thursday's forthcoming trip to Baku because the Azerbaijani authorities cancelled the official part of his visit today.
According to Telička, Baku justifies this with a resolution by the EP last week, which criticises the human rights violations in Azerbaijan and of which Telička co-authored.
By ruling the Azerbaijani Telička party, he lost the possibility of talks with official partners, as well as a visit to political prisoners that depends on the approval of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press release.
Telička wanted to use the trip, which was planned for several months in advance, to meet with the parliamentary leadership and representatives of the executive as well as with representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, the text sent to the Czech Press Agency.
The EP resolution condemns the "unprecedented repression against civil society in Azerbaijan."
It called on European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after a recent ruling over Azerbaijani opposition journalist Khadija Ismail, who advocated the detection of corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out building its air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky's visit to Novosibirsk did not rule out the creation of a Russian air base in Syria in the future.
We don't have plans like that yet.
But nothing is out of the question, he said.
Russia already has a long-running naval base in the port of Tartus in Syria, which it has so far used more as a service and logistics center.
According to Russian press reports, however, since the beginning of August, the supply of Russian weaponry and military equipment to Syria has risen.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from the trade agreements in force.
The Pentagon claims that the Russians intend to establish an air base outside the city of Latakia, which for the time being remains a stronghold of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
But Washington is not entirely clear about Russia's specific military intentions in Syria, US commentators agree.
US Secretary of State John Kerry spoke to Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov about the situation in Syria on Tuesday, their third telephone conversation in the last ten days.
Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, will travel to Moscow next week to convey concern about the gathering of a Russian arsenal near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Assad's support for Assad a lost bet.
He said of Russia's policy objectives in Syria that they were rather unclear.
Moscow, he said, had made Syria its own satellite.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a long-term goal, but what a, according to Earnest, it is not entirely clear.
The war in Syria is expected to be the main topic of Putin's speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York, according to today's Russian press speculation.
The situation in Donbass, Ukraine, on the other hand, is said to be not intended to be discussed by the Russian leader at all.
According to a report by The New York Times today, the US government is not ruling out that President Barack Obama might meet with the Russian president during the UN meeting.
But the views among White House advisers are said to be divergent so far.
Citing the words of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, TASS wrote today that Putin does not yet have a meeting with Obama on the schedule for his New York stint.
Place the seed oil on the gallbladder diet, the cannabis helps to boost immunity.
A good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is the use of extra virgin oils.
When pressed from cold seeds, all healthy substances will remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of the health diets, such as gallbladder.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.
These, according to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, are the most common reason for the deaths of Czechs for several years.
Bile inflammation mainly worries women, helps sesame oil.
If you are one of the lovers of Asian cuisine, you must not miss sesame oil in the pantry, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of dishes and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids it contains are a good prevention of the formation of gallstones.
These are 90% the cause of gallbladder inflammation and women suffer from these conditions 3 times more often than men.
In general, the gallbladder problem affects people who are particularly involved in overweight who do not play sports and consume a lot of animal fats.
Seasonal oil can be successfully used in a liver diet, which is very similar to the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits that this oil brings, they should be careful about the goods from the exotic food shops.
Manufacturers from Asia often use overfed seeds to press, which have a more pronounced taste.
But the oil will lose all the active ingredients, described Ladislav Hačecký, Executive Director from the Czech company Bohemia Olej from Kraslic in Sokolovsk, which produces cold-pressed bio virgin oils.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unroasted seeds of white sesame.
In an hour, our press can be pressed 8 kilos of sesame.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material heats up to a maximum of 40 degrees and therefore the product meets the criteria for the extra virgin designation.
Higher temperatures would result in the loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil benefits from heart and blood vessel diseases.
The Czech favourite among the oils is sunflower.
Jarmila Hamerska's research, which led at Masaryk University, showed that 43% of respondents preferred it in the warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, it is already starting to be switched at 180 °C.
It is better to use it for seasoning salads, for example, and is particularly useful in diet, in which it helps to prevent cardiovascular disease.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which reduce cholesterol levels the most of all fatty acids.
At heart problems, you should be careful of the amount of fat and calories taken overall.
For example, there are 62 calories in one spoonful of sunflower oil, with 99 calories in a spoonful of rapeseed oil.
As for the energy value of food, it is important to realise that natural food with nutrients is much more appropriate than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
It is therefore advisable to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower one lasts just like sesame and hemp for 9 months.
Storage in the fridge will be longer shelf life longer.
Old oil is particularly recognized by the bitter taste.
In contrast, there is no painkillers at the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance was not chemically refined.
Cannabis oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of technical cannabis are one of the so-called superfoods, which is why hemp oil is considered the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This designation is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 of unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be made by the body themselves and a person must take them from food.
Particularly important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study by scientists published in the European journal of clinical nutrition showed that the daily intake of the substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece will consume it with 0.6 grams, while the Icelanders accept 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Cannabis oil should be included in the menu as part of a supportive diet to boost immunity and when healing injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of the cell membranes.
People need not be afraid of using hemp oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers is confirmed by the fact that it is one of the best-selling in Bohemia Oil.
It is sold 500 litres a year.
People often use one of the fasting tables in the morning.
Cannabis oil is not spectacular in taste, but it will strengthen immunity well, advised Daniel Vlček from the beauty company Bohemia Olej.
According to the statistics, the most passionate nation in barbecues is Americans.
There's 1.4 grills per household.
There are then various barbecue competitions around the world, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
Not even the Czechs are behind.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people in their lives have been ungrilling.
The vast majority then grind several times a year.
We must not underestimate the preparation to make the barbecue a successful one - the ideal is to adjust the meat by marining a few hours before the heat treatment.
Which oil is the most suitable for this and at the same time leaves health-goods for a barbecue?
In general, the barbecue process itself should be conserved with fat.
Experts agree that a large proportion of the oils begin to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils then also lose the body's beneficial substances, which we otherwise get from them when consuming oils from dishes prepared at lower temperatures.
But it does not mean that extra virgin oils will not find their use in the grilling.
A grape oil for barbecue, health and beauty.
When you say meat, the experts from the company Bohemia Oil from Kraslice in Sokolovsk immediately equip themselves with the grape oil.
It is wonderful to complement the taste of the masses and the fish.
The kitchen features a unique feature of enhancing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling as it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature, he thus stores health benefit substances as one of the few oils, describes the benefits of grape oil Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Olej, which is one of the few Czech producers of this vine oil.
Experts agree that the grape oil is 50 times more potent than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high amounts of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in combating the excess of cholesterol.
In the grape oil, our body also receives important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the beneficial content of these substances, it helps to lower high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape oil, we also help to increase our external beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and spooky hair.
Chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example when seasoning salads, but also for the heat treatment of dishes.
The barbecue can therefore be used in two ways, in marinating and the barbecue itself.
By marinating the meat and the fish, we will preserve their succulence.
Three components present in the preparation of the marinade: oil, acidity and spices.
For example, we will add acidity to apple vinegar and thus achieve a softening of the meat.
The spice in turn gives the meat the taste and the oil it can preserves and adds the right edge, advises Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, he adds, the grape oil is ideal for marinating because it can lay through dark meat as one of the few oils.
So the marinated meat or the fish are ready to grill, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterised by the fact that only a few drops are enough to prepare the dishes.
The same goes for barbecue.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method of preparation.
This applies in particular to flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Rub the grate with oil before the grilling itself, preventing the food from burning.
The preparation of the attachments is also a necessary part of the barbecue.
Grilled meat and fish are suitable for just about anything - grilled vegetables, toasted bread, a light vegetable salad and many more.
Chefs from Bohemia Olej recommend, for example, the Hot Summer Salad.
To do it you need: • 1 piece peach • 1 bunch of rucola • 1 cup of sliced cucumber • 1 cup of salad leaf mix »Minetsos • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
Add to the salad bowl the salad pile of the torn rucola, the sliced cucumbers and the large cubes sliced peach.
Salt and season with salt and pepper to taste, you can also season with ground chilli and soy sauce.
To finish, tap with a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can sprinkle the salad with finely sliced almonds.
Scattered sclerosis: it is not just the medication that matters, but the will of the patient to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease, and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of experts: a neurologist, a physiotherapist, an ergotrap, a urologist, an ophthalmologist, a psychologist, a psychiatrist, and many other specialists.
However, it is not just about therapeutic care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultations, if they decide to have a child, social counseling, recommendations on housing arrangements, etc.
Yet all this is not enough: the development of the disease can be fundamentally influenced by the patient himself.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work and not have to fundamentally change the style of his life.
In fact, as doctors point out, the passivity of the sufferers leaves room for disease activity.
For example, it is shown that regular movement significantly delays the time when the sufferer needs a compensatory aid, such as a stick.
It is important that patients and their surroundings do not succumb to various myths, such as that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
That is why the Get a Chance page (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign, was created.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is the neurologist.
For multiple sclerosis, the adage that the treatment of the disease is the first time the doctor can have a problem.
This is because we have medication for multiple sclerosis in an inflammatory stage, when the neurodegeneration process is not so strong.
The earlier we intervene, the greater the hope that we will be able to stop the disease and delay the disability, explains M.D. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague.
It is very important in people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often solves weakening of lower limbs or balance disorders.
The patients are worked according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthening the pelvic floor, alleviating swallowing disorders or improving coordination.
"It's really individual, depending on the patient's specific problems," says M.D. Martina Kövári, head of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine at the University Hospital Motol.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it manifests in a slightly different way for each.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but can always relieve its symptoms.
Motion activity, however, also strengthens the body's immune condition, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive of regular exercise is the fact that the sick testify to what they can do, and that reinforces their self-assurance.
"Descination is also flushed out during the exercise and makes you feel good," the PhDr points out. Kamila Řasová from the Clinic of Rehabilitation Medicine at the Royal Vinohrady University Hospital.
By influencing the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
We are directly interfering with the psyche and immune processes and stabilizing the disease, he adds.
"Previously, these patients were so-called spared, today we know they need targeted loads," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, head of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine at the University Hospital Motol.
Physiotherapy aims to be able to remain self-sufficient for as long as possible, including a job.
The physiotherapists therefore work with the ergoterpureures to give each person a compensatory aid made to measure him.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, it shakes people up.
They're in shock, panic, fear.
It must respond to the heavy burden - the loss of health.
With such a soorced soul, we're supposed to go to someone, not try to get carried away on our own shoulders.
"I work with them in such a way that they will eventually come to the conclusion that even with a handicap you can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubertová from the Neurological Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague-based manufacturer Latecoere, the Airbus would not fly.
Aircraft is synonymous with accuracy and advanced technologies.
The new aircraft are full of titanium or lightweight and solid composite materials that no one can produce and process.
Yet, alongside the super-picture, computer-controlled machine tools, you can come across something as ordinary as apricot kicks as apricot knitted.
In a drum that resembles a sugar-carjacket pot, the bunk's pile is rehashed with the edges of the tin parts that have just come out of the milling machine.
"So far, no one has come up with anything better," smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of the air doors manufacturer Latecohere Czech Republic.
In the area in Letňany, Prague, the former Letov produces a complete door for the Airbus A320.
They are the only ones in the world to deliver the door for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The door, part of which is being assembled in Prague, also enters the first and higher class at the top of the world's largest airliner, the Airbus A380 Airbus A380.
There are also assembling composite doors for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto.
Perhaps the torque keys are being made by the company twice a year.
Should the yellow label lacking a record of the checkpoint be lacking, they would have a lot to explain to the auditors from Airbus or Boeing at the Prague plant, who come regularly to see if the doors are made according to the agreed rules.
The human senses, however, have not yet been completely replaced by advanced technology.
There are 1,500 rivets on one door to the A320.
These must be shattered by the rivets.
It takes them two days.
Even by the sound of the falling hammer, they can tell if the rivet is properly shaky.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The riveting can protrude from zero to 0.13 millimetres above the surface.
That's about twice the thickness of a human hair.
The check-up comes with a trained touch.
When the inspector runs his finger over a series of rivets, he will know if any are beyond tolerance.
Only then does he pick up the exact aberration.
The flightov nurtured the training military aircraft program of the L-39 military aircraft before 1989.
But in 1991, not a single one was produced.
The company had to find new orders quickly.
At the time, she hooked up with European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the tender for the Emergree Doors supplier for the A331 model.
The courtship with Boeing was not so happy.
"We were a small company for them at the time that didn't have enough money to invest and to guarantee Boeing long-term stable deliveries," Dubský recalls.
The door to the American manufacturer would have been slammed shut if Letov had not taken the French group, Latecoere, at the Prague conference of the international aviation industry association in 1999.
I spoke there about our collaboration with Airbus.
Negotiations with the French were underway the next day, says Dubský.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and new contracts came with a strong company.
In 2000, the assembly of parts of the door for the A320 started.
Three years later, the upper deck door was added to the A380s.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall for deliveries to the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we would not have gotten to these big commissions ourselves.
Maybe we'd do parts or small parts.
The partners want the guarantees of deliveries for twenty or thirty years, explains Dubský.
Last year, the Czech Latecoere achieved a turnover of over 2.9 billion and a profit after tax of CZK 147 million.
The exclusive position among aircraft manufacturers is not free of charge.
Latecoere has invested CZK 1.5 billion in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certifications of 170 special production processes and certificates of qualifications for key employees.
Without them, the business would not have made any aircraft doors.
It costs them to obtain certificates that the production processes meet the requirements of customers and to keep them in repeated inspections, according to Dubský.
Production processes change every year.
They are more accurate and stricter.
We have to train employees, retrofit the facilities and re-certify the whole process, Dubský adds.
Now the company is finalizing the preparation of a process for the topping of zinc and nickel, which will replace the existing harmful cadmium-harmed for human health.
They received the assignment from the manufacturer, but then had to adapt the technology for the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
The people of Boeing are coming, checking out the whole line's concept.
Then we'll show them the production.
They will also check our laboratory.
They will test one set of samples themselves in their laboratory and then compare the results with ours, Dubský says, approximating the way the customers check them.
The reward is the Prague company's long-term exclusive contracts.
The Prague plant today stands and falls the production of embrays.
For the A320, it produces half of the total door volume.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
But it doesn't mean he can say any price at the door.
The contract includes a price curve.
It indicates how much one door will cost in ten, fifty, hundreds of pieces made.
The price per piece keeps dropping to a certain limit value.
We must fit into this price formula.
If not, we'll lose money, says Dubsky.
Meanwhile, half the hallway, where the electric cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are assembled, is empty.
But it is a symbol of the future.
Behind the screen, a new semi-robotic line for rip and door mounting for the upgraded A320 Neo is being built.
The ripening will accelerate and refine.
"This is the trend of assembly in aviation," Dubský adds.
The outlet has a future line secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have so far ordered 3278 new A320 units.
Just a few metres away, there will be a line for a complete installation of the door for the top deck of the A380.
It's the strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could start in two years, says Dubský.
Before that, however, the company must undergo skills tests for, say, the installation of some electrical and electronic devices for the largest Airbus.
The company is also betting on the further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should also participate in the new Airbus A350 program to compete with the US Dreamliner.
"It's a huge credit for the company when it can process composite composites in addition to metal materials," Dubský says proudly.
However, the Latecohere is getting to the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There is no more place in the Letov area where it is located.
Prior to the French mother's entry, the company had 180 employees.
Now he has 800, and within three years, there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing compete to see how many hundreds of new planes the airline is ordering each year, they may not be worried about their jobs.
Although it has contracts for several years to come, the parent company of Prague's Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group didn't have enough money for the loan repayments in September.
Eventually, Latecoere was able to reach an agreement with the main creditors.
At the end of August, she traded some of their loans for shares.
Creditors received a 37.4 percent stake in the company by increasing the capital by €57.4 million.
The company's debt fell by two-thirds, or €180 million.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company subscribed new shares to the current shareholders for EUR 222.9 million.
In total, it raised the share capital by €280 million.
At the same time, the group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85 percent of sales.
It expects average contract growth of four percent per year until 2017.
He has orders in the custom book for €2.6 billion, which is equivalent to four-year production.
French media say Latecocer can finally take another breath after years on the drip.
The Czech race in Prague's Letňany is significant for the groups.
It contributes 16 percent to the group's sales.
Depending on the number of employees, it is the group's largest foreign branch.
The MPs supported a larger share of the state's coal fees.
The change in mineral mining fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenues of the municipalities' budgets are to have a neutral impact because the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year, municipalities received roughly CZK 450 million of the fees and the state budget of CZK 150 million.
The mining of brown coal was worth about 200 million crowns to the municipalities and the state to the state of CZK 66 million.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the remuneration from the mining premises with the permitted mining to CZK 1,000 per hectare per year.
The receipt of these reimbursements is to continue to be fully owned by the municipalities.
Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that this would give municipalities a year instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
Revenue is newly calculated as the product of the amount of the extracted mineral and the rates for each type of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
But ODS MEP Marek Benda warned against the fact that the setting of the fee by government decree may not be in line with the constitution.
According to the Minister Mládek, however, this is not a tax, because the state charges the mineral, which is state property.
The fees are received only by municipalities whose territory is affected by the mining.
In the case of deep-sea coal, three-quarters of the municipality's money and a quarter will be given to the state.
The same ratio will be for the extraction of radioactive rock.
Some of the money the state will collect in the mining fees will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after the extraction or to provide the Mining Rescue Service.
The draft was criticised today by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that they would damage the municipalities affected by the mining and the regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have done so far, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to have the Finance Minister improve his budget," said David Kádner (Dawn) chosen in the Ústí Region.
Ahead of the rise in unemployment in Most, KSČM MEP Hana Aulická warned.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kucera wanted to return the law to the government for completion.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to mining firms, the fee increase will not be reflected in the price of coal, as prices are more than 90 percent contracted for the long term.
So major consumers like power plants or heating plants should not feel the rise in prices.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in reimbursements by seeking to reduce their operating expenses, which would mean a reduction in the number of employees in the first place," the government admits.
However, according to her, the increase in fees in terms of employment is bearable.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that MPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining.
If coal is mined beyond limits, then it will have impacts on revenues for both the state and the municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with the Met that the decision to break the limit at the mine of the Czechoslovak Army should not be made until after 2020.
The limits at the CSA mine should be breached for social, economic reasons, and for the long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time for interest rate decisions for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching the US Federal Reserve set to meet in two days' time on Wednesday and Thursday to make a major decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey by the 80 economists interviewed by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they would remain inactive for some time, leaving interest rates in the range of 0-0.25 percent.
It is a historic event because it has been saddled with years since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the main central bank could be able to get off the zero bar and start the process of normalizing interest rates," says Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has performed reasonably well, with a recovery in the form of the addition of trillions of dollars to the state's account and create only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore a less rosy global perspective.
They warned markets to be ready for an increase, but the circumstances suggest that they also see great odds against this move.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday 20:00 CET.
Shooter at State University Delta left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi - and later that day on the same day - wrote a note claiming that he was "laughter" of the first murder and that he wished to take it back, was discovered by government authorities on Tuesday.
Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a geography and social science teacher at State University of Delta, called the police at about 10 a.m. on Monday morning
and he said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send the police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and also mentioned that there was a "cute dog" in the house who "will not be bothering anyone" but is upset.
The police demanded the caller's name, but Lamb did not introduce himself.
Lamb also did not explain why the house was fired.
When the police arrived at the scene of the crime, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from Lamb, which said, "I'm so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only person who ever loved me."
After leaving the message, Lamb set off on a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
University dean William LaForge said he knew of no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "something was clearly taking place in Mr. Lambo's head."
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss's romantic relationship with Schmidt, government officials said there was no "no evidence" of the "love triangle."
Shawn O'Steen, who had been married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was a "great person."
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but both remained friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Sheen and Prentiss was "shaken up" by the case.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as the Sun Herald put it, Prentiss worked from the house online.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, dated Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help the others," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he would "not go to jail."
When officers caught up with him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled into the woods, where he shot himself.
According to a biography published on the school's website, Lamb received his doctorate in education at Delta University in the spring of 2015.
The stars that have lost their charms
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has had several stressful years.
He struggled with leukemia in 2001 and lost his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett in 2009 for cancer.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was arrested for drug possession in 2008.
All of these things are certainly taking their toll.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be out of the game for several months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double-broker of his right leg during Manchester United's defeat in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left-back has left this injury in tears and has been sidelined for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by a reckless tackle by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw broke into PSV.
He was treated on the playground for nine minutes and an oxygen mask was also needed before he was rushed to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double leg fracture and is now in the hospital."
He will be taken over tomorrow or perhaps the day after and then continued to operate in Manchester.
It's terrible - a guy who comes to Manchester at the age of 18 has it very hard, but he plays fantastic and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he also wore an oxygen mask.
Crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group stage.
I believe he will play again this season.
Moreno was very lucky not to receive a red card and a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian referee had made a mistake.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very nasty procedure with both feet.
The Shaw Account Tweet says: "Thank you all for their reports, in words it is not possible to express how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins now and I will come back even stronger."

The England defender will have an added incentive to recover in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It was a very nasty injury."
When any player leaves the field with an injury like that, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the goal of our players to hurt the opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg in a match for Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very hard for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear about the seriousness of such an injury, it's not good," said Cocu.
I was unable to see this moment.
I only saw the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see the tackle on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
It makes me feel very bad, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital following the procedure of Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
This is the thing known to every parent: when a child falls in love with a book, it doesn't take him long to memorize it.
Of course, you mustn't be David Cameron.
Asked by a provider of children's schemes to name a popular children's book, the Prime Minister Lorax, a fable by Dr Seuss, was chosen.
It was hard to choose, writes Cameron in a report posted on the SuperCamps website, and goes on: "Visive, touching, creative and with strong content, I liked to read this to my children because there was always an image or message behind it that I had not seen before."
Well, after that, in the following paragraph, Cameron allegedly described the plot of the book from the 2012 film's lift, which added more characters and details to fill in the briefed original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville, surrounded by walls, where all nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the hearts of a girl of her dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," is a brief contents of a book that records the object of love unknown Dr Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if it weren't suspicious enough, the text supplied by Cameron reads as the summary elevator of the film Lorax, which is found on the Internet of the Movie Database, and begins with the words: "In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by walls, where all nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of her dreams, Audrey."
Being an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would be acquainted with the plot of the book, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is devastated by the raging, trees-spopping industrialist-Islamist who, despite the protests of the titular Lorx, the crouched, the mustachiest part of the creature who "speaks for the trees."
In all likelihood, such a relatively low-grade PR task was given to a sidekick who had never read Lorax to the child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was most likely from the office of Cameron's followers.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by an employee of Cameron, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in jeopardy for England's omission but still holding
Riveting with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but after seeing the team England's pick on this tour, I think it will be less than likely to be a repeat of the 3-hIL defeat they suffered in the test series last time.
I also wouldn't directly rule out the visitors' win.
Alastair Cooka's side may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good players of spin in this bathing set, and also the collective thinking is strong; they will not carry the scars of 2012, only a youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is a developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although he is unknown at the level of the test series, represents the attacking option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped out of the England team in an experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to omit Adam Lyth is a tough challenge for me to analyze because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests were up against two good attacks in challenging conditions and a simple one, but the harsh reality is that the cricket players are judged on the basis of performance.
There were no question marks around Joe Root's name, which led to the announcement, because-and I've said this before-the players are their top selectors.
A few more half-centuries, and Lyth could have extended his streak, but he had control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he can get more runs for the Yorkshire, there's another opportunity.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his stance, even though his performances were not entirely 100 per cent, and I'm not surprised; he was always a team player.
The question of how much test time the baton gets to show himself is a tough nut to crack.
Lyth was given seven caps-as well as Sam Robson before him-while Nick Compton won nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and away.
The only thing you could grumble for is that England gave Jonathan Trott's chance in the Caribbean first-ethough Lyth was in the best shape-but this wasted opportunity is a thing of the past.
Here comes Alex Hales, and he's a baton I rate very positively.
He's a cricketner cricketer player we saw here in Yorkshire at the start of the season, when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which kind of did.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors have been given, but of course all this will depend on the overall line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen starting alongside Cook, who would get another extra spinner while he would do four quicks, was brought up and I have no reservations about it.
I don't understand why the machine-box can't be fired and this left-handed man has already shown that he's an amazing cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 for them, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 rehearsals before his performance in 2001.
He had managed immediately three centuries and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a backup spinner and when I had a chance to watch him, I was intrigued as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough statistics - an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and I see that as a rogue, but there aren't a lot of spinners to raise their hands, and the selector opted for a young man.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, it appears that England have made several changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardene, the Sri Lanka batsman, as a consultant for the test matches, can be a masterpiece.
He's one of the most beautiful-played guys who bring a lot of experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in a part of the white-ball tour and brings both energy and a merciless sparkle to the team.
I've always felt that he was born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and, like Mahel, possesses the intellect that can be used.
New voices in the locker room, even if they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can occasionally lighten the atmosphere.
Colly Durham's teammate Ben Stokes was given a one-day leave, just as Root got a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this decision.
Even if many disagree, the trainers and the selector do not form a timetable.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
David Cameron's ill-conceived strategy of renegotiating David Cameron to keep Britain in the EU is getting into more trouble with each passing day without the election of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to lead the Workers' Party, or the TUC will take the whole situation around Europe in parade on Tuesday.
The foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of a European diplomat recently explained how Europe is mired in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States have already had enough of the British egocentric agendas, dividing concessions and disruptive treaty changes, which they mostly did not want.
At its one-year meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that they didn't want it even if they eroded social protection.
We can even call it a selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor attend summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home, saying they are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants a wicked Britain in Europe in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggesting that some of the short-sighted ministers and officials in some of the capitals have reached a point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, Germany's cautiously balanced chancellor, is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before she becomes a bad one for her, as has been the case with the long-running Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Frenchman François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is also declining.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right side, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to see the way they break their feet in helping the Selfie of the British, who could better invest their energies to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they do not want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may be planning deliberately useless SNPs-style remarks during the 2017 referendum campaign in the UK to hasten the Brexit process, a friend says.
"The re-negotiations have solved the problem" and "Britain has no value in the negotiations."
Europeans, to their own detriment, know how predatory Fleet Street can be and how sceptical the EU is by the press oligarchs barons, because they were not 2-1 in support of our 1973 entry in 1975 during the 1975 referendum.
They can vaguely remember the name Boris Johnson, a disappointing Euro-opportunist who made his name as the Brussels-based "EU straight bananas" correspondent in the early 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of scoundrels not paying taxes, foreigners hacking phones, and pseudo non-interorations that owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same about them, but he realized that when you were in a cage with a frantic gorilla, you had to throw bananas to her to keep you from having you dinner, and then tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum routine, since Blair admitted the principle of the abolished EU constitution, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and won him a drop card.
The press never forgave him either.
But the dear Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me amicably on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him that he must not waste time on me - seems to be in the danger of accepting the strategy of the boycott of Murdoch Neilin Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to work out coherent media engagement strategies, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose chair he left at the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe, I will say it pleasantly, is evolving.
He argues that he would like to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the frantic tendencies of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism can certainly accept that.
Hilary's "Bemm, but not Benniite" had said the same thing to Benn on both radio and television this week when his inner scout could not commit to admitting that Corbyn's appointment of the abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father fought on television for his loyalty without going too far and lost his job.
Hillary's fight was much more attractive.
But to fight to stay 'at all the circumstances' - Benn's phrase - it was by all accounts not what McDonnell was saying, nor what JC told colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background, the sensitive image that Corbyn wants to convey - don't forget, he touched me as well - the discipline of the news remains important in the ages of television all day and especially in the faith, the parher of paranoia and betrays that social media
It is fair to not provide Cameron with a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to consider the support of the Workers' Party in the referendum campaign to be made obvious, as McDonnell put it.
Simon Jenkins is definitely thinking that.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic preoccupations about EU membership - in line with their Bennite besieging economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric debate among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small differences is the central essence of dogmatic squabbling.
As with his squirming about Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of all this for their landlords.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - because of Britain's concessions when it seems pointless?
The United States is already quite disappointed in the brisk "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the costs of the Conservative government in power, as I was recalled at the launch of something called the Security Forum of British Influence on Monday.
Experts criticise review review of electronic published by Public Health England
The government-funded statement by the agency that e-cigarettes is 95% safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are associated with the tobacco industry, the researchers say.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined the Lancet with a critique of the evidence used in their e-cigarette report by the Public Health England Agency (PHE).
PHE published the "crash" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the complexity of the data and drew attention to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet expert magazine last month attacked the "extremely flimsy base" on which the PHE news agency was basing its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for the BMJ disputed the allegations that were allegedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of efficacy."
They indicate that the public might expect that the PHE claim is "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed examination of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people called to prepare an analysis of the multi-criterion (MCDA) decision analysis of the model to synthesise their views on the damage associated with the various nicotin-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in the research report.
McKee and Capewell report that one of the sponsorship of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO had allegedly previously raised funds from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also approved the Public Health Forecasting of BAT in the Sustainability Report, he says.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting awarded funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, but they add not to the financing it allegedly received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reason for the selection of panel members is not available, but they do include a few well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also declare industrial financing in the newspapers.
Some of the other people present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting in PHE was also attended by the tobacco management.
The report produced in this group "tellingly admits," the missing "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products to most of the products on most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these references or limitations is described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the PHE's claim that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes act as a smoking route for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said the BMJ claim had already been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking."
One of the two lifelong smokers will die because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small compared to the case, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear duty to inform the public of what the evidence shows, and also what it does not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die from smoking-related illnesses a year, and smoking costs the NHS to £2 billion a year.
By highlighting the current evidence - that even if e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they bear only a fraction of the damage caused to smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC to end with EastEnders, former Channel 4 director says
Former Channel 4 director Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give the right-hand man" for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said the licensing fee should only be used for programmes that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for deploying public service programs that are likely to be watched by only a handful of people, into the complex broadcasting times compared to its rivals, "the biggest rating show, and on channels like the BBC4.
After General Manager Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully to merge with the BBC for the six years he had worked on Channel 4.
"I am fighting the idea that the BBC is commissioning and broadcasting programmes that would certainly have been broadcast by rivals without state contributions," Johnson said on the Public House Communications Commission, as part of the BBC's Future Negotiations.
If you keep the royalties, which I am not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, should be reduced in terms of programs that are not made or not awarded to others.
They're broadcasting The Voice in prime time because they want to get the widest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would outsider it is a ridiculous joke, and, of course, nonsensical.
Johnson said: 'I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded without a post-contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course produced on home soil.
Honestly, other channels would give them their right-hand hand.
I can't understand how these public broadcasters are.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC in the slightest.
Johnson, the show's businessman, who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty about catching up with ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His commentary on the BBC's most popular show reiterates those that former Sky Managing Director, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sells a show like EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the more shocker-broken public service programmes of the BBC "transfer to the BBC4, where quite often the audience cannot be measured, but they are fulfilling their authority and can argue when they are preparing to justify the £4bn income from the royalties, "But of course we do all these obscure programs that no one looks at."
They're broadcasting them when they're not looked at.
As for the licence fee, Johnson told the commission: 'I'm calling you to find a more regressive system about which one gets the best value from it.
Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a big deal, but for people for whom 150 pounds is a lot, I'd be surprised if they paid so much because they don't watch the BBC as much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who appeared before the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should review its reith mission in the sense of "informing, educating and entertaining."
He confirmed that the BBC's small production volume had now been classified as educational - with 1% of television production and 0.1% on the radio - and should take as a model of public public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and turn into "informing, clarifying and entertaining."
On the subject of the partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like the Proms, of which only a handful was broadcast on television, and join in with commercial reporters so that we can see them all online.
‘Sonogeneetics’ or control of brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how the sound pulses affect the direction the nematodes move.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled by sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction when they are hit by sound impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
The pulse works by switching off the cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: Reuters can read and write brain activity using light
Scientists said these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics that uses ultrasound to activate the brain, heart and muscle cells and activate outside the body.
Sekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which the patient's brain is injected with electrodees that stimulate the brain of the brain. The method is used for example to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
The mushrooms don't usually respond to the ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction would come when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he discovered, the bubbles are amplified by ultrasonic waves, which then pass through the worm's body.
The reinforced ultrasonic waves are active in the TRP-4 ion channels, which are found in the membranes of some worm cells.
With the sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells they are linked to, a report from the journal Nature Communications.
In order to control the nematodes using ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain the TRP-4 ion channels.
Then, when he used ultrasound on the worms so modified, the sound waves were amplified with microbububsins and carried to the worms, where they turned on the modified motor neurons.
The new method is much like optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn on and off with the neurons using light.
Chalasani, however, has been quoted as saying that sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike the light, which must be sent by the optical fiber to the desired place in the brain, ultrasonic waves can penetrate the tissues without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that using gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasonic signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also find its application in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.

And electric stunning batons that cause excruciating pain but leaving no trace!
The hilarious voice and caricature of metaphor leave no doubt that this advertisement at the world's largest gun fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the defence and security facilities of the International Veselice at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands district.

But a separate campaign is also conducted with the emergence of posters at bus stops and metres, which require a second view.
"Important notices, DLR travel from 15 to 18 September?" reads one, using a font with London Undergemark plates with the DLR lines to become a picture of a tank.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will descend on the DLR ... Customers are being asked to help stop the arms deal.
The 300 posters are created by artists exhibiting their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
The Special Patrol Group team helped distribute them all over London and use "Ad Space Hack Packs," which is £6 apiece of the Allen key, which supposedly "gets access to about a third of the advertising space of the planet's bus stops."
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies made by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and assistant professor at the University of Essex, the artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to viewers outside the galleries.
Many artists are switching to working with activists as part of the protest movements and are aware that they must get out in the real world in order to have an impact on society.

The Amnesty video was viewed on Facebook by more than 100,000 people in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP agency working without the fee and the graphic designer and the commentator also worked for free.
The VCCP's creative director, Matt Lever, would be surprised by the silence surrounding the arms store ads - he saw an empty spot on the ExCeL calendar - and he thought, "Let's show them a campaign that they're trying to avoid."
They were toying with the creation of a more realistic risky corporate ad, but "adding colorful colors and animations, we've made the eye of more people."
"They have done a fantastic job and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK Government to take action to ensure that the torture device is not being traded illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the gun store comes from within ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. military on the "arm-offer of the AT4CS RS."
This includes "a unique shaped warhead that provides amazing effects from behind the armor inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in the student dorm
11 years ago, I moved to the college of students as an oblivious nineteen-year-old boy, still religious in the beret and moral relativism, but only now do I recall the tense smiles of those I wowed - and numerous, lengthy, lengthy complaints about others.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving to the tracks can range from a slightly nerve-racking to the totally appalling one.
It's tempting to babble: telling people where you're from, if you took a year's break, how you feel about Corbyn and why "you sincerely love or hate Marmite, because you guys, it's just a TRAGUE extract from the yeasts, I'll be in your room."
Take a deep breath.
And help the others to take a breath, too - ask and express concern.
It's running a conversation and it's going to help you find the people you love, and the ones you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes were in the fire and they'd release the firecrackers.
Leave the people's space.
People's rooms often turn into drinking receptions, movie evenings and communal public spaces, but they are also rooms in which people dress and customize their underwear.

The Introverts in college will come in short.
Your room should be a haven for sanctuary, yet a lot of colleges turn into an off-the-cuff walking culture that is friendly, sociable and contributes to lifelong friendships.
This may be hell for someone who needs to recharge.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave, to be able to return to the energy I've used up to talking to you."
Try to see when a classmate is tired of socializing - and maybe write him a place to knock.
Speaking of knocking: tap.
A boy in my dorms was the custom that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends by baking.
Since you started going to the university at the top of baking mania, knocking on someone else's door and the show with the bunked cakes seem slightly less strange than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've baked you a little, now smile while I ask the personal questions."
Offering homemade delicacies is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obligated to talk to you, and maybe it will all end up by tying your face to a tasty surprise.
This is, of course, the object of being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar and a stiff will likely guarantee that others will pretend to sleep if you try to knock on their door.
The food theft is a common crime in student dormitories.
The theft of the whole chicken is a crime, of course, but is there a drop of milk in your tea theft?
Check with the milk owner twice.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're going to go wild inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more mature than my roommate, who swapped her milk for a dishwashing device to punish the thieves.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't make noises that disturb people from sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decent human being, it's also the proverbial people in the glass houses.
The girl from my hallway asked her neighbors if they could turn down drum and bass a little bit because it was 3 at night and had a test in the morning.
Their response was to amplify the music.
When they finally fell silent at 5 a.m., she let them sleep peacefully for two hours, and then played her own music out loud, locked the door and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse went to the same dormitories as you did?
Conversely, wouldn't it be appallingly embarrassing if you mistook your roommates for your future spouse, sleep together, break up and have to see each other every day, and maybe take control of your mutual friends?
Of course, you're not going to guarantee your heart - but if your hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, try to talk to your weaknesses a little.
At an uplifting moment, when you realize someone left the keys in their unlocked room, there's only a fine line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their security by saving them something - never whip someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door for them and put the keys in a water bottle, which you then stick in the freezer - but never stick their stuff on the ceiling for them more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva had a rough time already during her pregnancy with the now seven-year-old Vítek.
His father broke up with her, and she was alone to prepare and raise her offspring.
I came to terms with the situation quite quickly - I was very much looking forward to the child and looking for positives in it.
Uncertainty and by being alone with the child, I tried not to worry.
And I certainly had the hope that we wouldn't be alone for a long time, Eva recalls her first pregnancy today.
She had already met online at the cottage of the elder Vasek, with whom they began to talk about their favourite films.
Vašek even brought Eva and Vítko home from the maternity ward, but he did not rude much to the role of stepfather.
"He then withdrew from the program for a while," Eva described in the documentary series Four in That 3.
The motive for the third series of the Czech TV series is just the search for happiness on the second attempt.
She managed the care of Vítek and the family's financial security thanks to part-time work and great help for her mother and to help the aunt's help.
In the end, the prospects for responsibility for a foreign child did not spoil Vasek's affection for Eva.
They finally got together around Vítkov's second birthday and he now understands Vasek as his dad and he also addresses him that way.
Although Vasek already has two adult daughters, she says she enjoys paternity at the age of 60, and she is also more interested in children.
In addition to Vítek, they were joined by two-year-old Leontýnka and eventually twins.
"Vasek came into our family sort of naturally, perhaps even by the fact that my mother never talked much into my relationships," the smiling Eva thinks.
Little room?
At least we're close.
The twins Emma and Ela were born by caesarean section after Eva was diagnosed with pregnancy-related choilaz at the end of her pregnancy.
This is a disorder of production and activity of bile acids, which are then found in the blood by the pregnancy in the blood and are particularly manifested by itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which is at risk of premature birth and death, in the mother after childbirth usually subscriber.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Eva and Vasek's happiness, even though they were only at the 36th week.
The emxtinator was placed in an incubator at the intermediate department, where Vasek's niece also works, who managed to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and immediately after being transferred from the ICU to my room I had it with me, she describes the challenging period after giving birth to Eva.
She spent twenty days in the maternity ward until the doctors had chosen to release the babies, who had managed to reach the two-kilometre mark.
Waiting to take on the children in the maternity ward, Eva, was not happy.
"I was a maddening homicorn for my husband and children," the mother of four-times recalls of the six-former ward.
She and her husband considered signing a reversal, including because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
However, this did not happen in the end, and the doctors discharged Eva and the twins to home care.
The stories of the four pregnancies and births are broadcast by ČT1 on Tuesday evening at 9:45 p.m.
A fairly large family can be cut back.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to make do with an electric two-plot and cramped conditions.
The house did not get bigger, but Vasek made Eva happy by mounting a gas cooker to make the food preparation more comfortable for six people.
If it's at its best, we'll take turns taking turns.
Eva is convinced that children are particularly aware of the family's well-being and pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or shabby of the cottage.
We've been stacking up very nicely for now, better than we expected.
The mess is harder to hide in a small space and we occasionally cross the juvenile babies, but at least we are all around, is smiling Eva, who can find a positive side for every situation.
Vaška's work of the lighting for the film is no guarantee of regular income.
That's why he sometimes takes to the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
At the age of 60, he says, he is physically managing the care of the finances of the family and the children, but how long will it be?
"I realize that, given our age difference, it will be me who will feed this family one day," Eva admits to the face of the future.
She would like to return to her job, but she is even more attracted by the possibility of her own business.
With four children, I'm not exactly a big deal for my employer.
And if the worst comes to the worst, my husband and I can take turns taking turns asking for a cab, jokes a sympathetic blonde.
Apple suffered a yo-yo effect.
It's all the shows.
A more powerful processor, a larger-resolution camera, a firmer chassis, or a touch-sensitive display are, in the shorter, the virtues of the ninth-generation iPhones introduced.
The last two then also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weights of the iPhon 6s and 6s Plus.
In fact, Apple's current trend was that each new generation of the iPhone was lighter than the previous one.
The exception was only the third and fourth-generation generations, whose weight increased slightly compared to the previous iPhones.
The two-gram mass difference to the detriment of the novelty was really negligible.
However, this is far from the case of new iPhones.
In fact, compared to last year's iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight grew by 14 grams for the smaller model, and the larger one by a whopping 20 grams.
On the one hand, it is not surprising, last year's affair by bending in Apple's pockets greatly troubled Apple.
The chassis of novelties is thus made of the more durable aluminium alloy 7000, which was also reflected in the weight.
But the displays have a much bigger impact on it.
In fact, Apple used 3D Touch technology for the novelties, which will make the displays recognize the power of touch.
To do this, the display had to be fitted with an additional layer of capacitive sensors.
The mass of the new iPhones' displays has thus increased more than twice as much as it has been previous generations.
The smaller iPhone from originally 12 grams to 29 grams, and for the smaller iPhone, from 19 to 40 grams.
For the iPhone 6s, the display is the toughest used component.
The weight of only 143 grams is then achieved in this novelty thanks to the flip-freeze bark, which touched most of the remaining components.
The larger model is then the heaviest feature used for the battery, but its weight has not changed compared to its predecessor.
In this case, too, the biggest increase is noticeable for the display.
The weight of the 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus is thus 192 grams.
To the extent that the new display technology will be practical, it will only become apparent when used.
The first users will be able to try out as early as Friday, September 25, when iPhone 6s and 6s Plus sales of the iPhones and 6s Plus will be launched in selected countries.
Have the flakes the breakfast of champions have been in the stands for tens of thousands of years?
In Grotta Paglc, Italy, the archaeologists have made a find that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of the settlement of modern man from different times, including murals, remnants of instruments, and so on and so on.
In the 23A layer, which according to the instruments is dated to around 30,000 years ago but discovered by scientists but something that is very reminiscent of the remnants of a breakfast buffet.
There were traces of oat grains on the site, which, to be seen, had apparently undergone the production process of the now-popular flakes.
At that time, the grains are dipped up today, then dried, stripped, the so-called plughty, then fiddled and spilled.
In the cave Pagllecci, the grains, which appeared to have been shaped or stew, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least the marks of use on the two stones in the cave suggest this.
So the scientists were unable to demonstrate in their publication to PNAS that there was a complete process of making flakes in the cave, but the similarity was indeed very noticeable.
We also have no evidence of how people could have eaten the flakes, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and, quite possibly, warm, is, of course, quite logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting illustration of how intensively people used cereals long before the creation of agriculture.
Indeed, if the flake's interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes outnchated agriculture by about twenty thousand years.
New station reports in the Transportation Enterprise of the City of Brno.
So I listened once again to the names of the stops in the trolleybus: Unusáčkova, Ghost, Frázova, Spratecká.
Of course, the trolleybus was a little noisier, so that the report in a man's voice was somewhat less intelligible than before, when the stops were reported in a woman's voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of the traffic traffic it is more recognizable than the deeper male voice.
DPMB argues that this announcer was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don't know, who, no one asked me, but they certainly chose that from studio recordings made in complete silence, which of course sounded quite different from the noise of the bus engine.
I have lived in Brno for quite a few decades for a long time, so I know the correct names of all the stops from memory, so I do not need these reports, but foreigners from elsewhere who are not familiar with themselves in Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended can be confused and can be confused at the final, where they accidentally arrived, then claim that the stop at which they were to speak has not been reported at all.
Perhaps the selection of the announcer - but better the announcer again - should be done again, and this time tinged with the normal traffic noise and the clattering of the engine in which the bus speaker's boiling point is almost lost.
So we don't have to listen to the names of the stations of Water Heršpice, Šmírova, or then the immersion in the creaking shawl and into which I transferred in Komárov.
I assume my old-age hearing didn't deteriorate at the same time in the one day that the announcer of the stops changed.
I understood the reports well before that day.
Good morning, comrade chief.
From the trackbook notes.
Today, few people know what the so-called complex clearances were during the reign of the party's biggest and smartest.
I took the liberty of reminiscing about it.
The bus was late.
I bumped into the dispatcher's office the moment it was said from the radio that it was seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't collide with the comrade chief, he came in a minute in front of you, and he doesn't seem to be in the mood," the dispatcher observed as I entered the book of arrivals.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Write to me that I am driving around the districts to revise the minor mechanization.
It's not going to work, there's background checks today.
It's all fucked up, it's a horror.
What is it all about?
"You'll see," the dispatcher said.
Next time you'll be, too.
I ran out into the hall.
Then the director's door opened and the chief appeared.
Stuffed, stony-faced, in a perfectly fitted uniform.
"Good morning, Chief," I said respectfully, quickly on the pair of uniform's jacket buttons.
"Good morning," came the reply, and I hurried out to the second floor without realizing the cold, ominous tone the old man answered.
"You're playing," said the engineer Eva, an elderly lady to whom I respected.
She said she was even a chief before the comrades deposed her.
There are background checks, and you'll arrive barely.
How many times have I asked what the comprehensive background checks are, but no one wants to talk about it much.
They say they're once every three years, they all have to go to them, and it's pretty uncomfortable.
At least for some.
I'll see.
I pulled the file out of the chopper with the periodic reports and that phone.
"Horcman here, come to me right away," the chief's voice said.
What's bothering?
Now we met and nothing ..." I muttered, but no one answered me, each with just their thoughts.
"Good morning, Comrade Chief, I came at your command," I faded, stepping into the chief's office.
The chief sat behind the desk, looking at some paperwork.
"Comrade Mechanator," he said after a moment, without raising his head and still studying the paperwork carefully, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the paperstroke down on the table, leaned back in the chair's arm, and stared at me with his usual, unpleasant, evil, prickle-faced gaze.
I'm uneasy.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the deputy praised himself for saying that in the few months in office I had worked very well and that he was very happy with me.
That the chief did very well to pull me out of the platoon at the distance.
And this?
You realize you're a track-way distance technician, and you have to act like it.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is just unacceptable.
I stammered that I've used such a greeting since I was a kid, that I've been raised that way, and I don't see anything wrong with it.
To the chief, it was like a red rag on a turkey.
"You are on the socialist railway and the only acceptable greeting is the honour of the work," the gnap behemoth-tinted chief.
Plus, you're still knitting the name of your superiors.
One day you say "sir" and the second time you say "comrade."
But I'm not the chief to you, but the vice chief.
The deputies are comrades deputies, the upper trackers are the comrades-in-chief of the trackers!
You'll kindly remember that!
Excuse me, sir... comrade chief, but... but I greeted you with a normal civil greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that ... and the honor of a job or a comrade ... you know ... I'm not in the party...
"It's not your preference that you're not in the party," the chief said coldly, calming down a bit.
It's still to be mentioned.
Anyway, remember, you don't have a pension prepaid the chair upstairs.
That was not good.
When the chief told someone that something was not his preference, it didn't look good with the person.
He gave me a cold, prickling glance, and I searched for the words to answer.
I was also annoyed by his condescending first-rounds.
He was only a few years older and playing the Lord, comrade-aboh, actually.
The heel, pompous, authoritarian, arrogant, suit him at the moment.
He's all pooled.
So be it, he's a chief.
In fact, not all of them, the chairman of the party organization, as all partisans but also independents, were on the first to name him.
But the chief tos to many, especially those with whom he could have applied his superiority.
He's just wiped me off for total bullshit.
I thought of something about the ass, and it took enough to overtake it so I wouldn't shoot it in his face.
But then I wouldn't go back to the treadmill, let alone keep me from being a railroad clerk.
What would I feed two kids out of?
Plus a built-in house!
I felt like crying, but I controlled myself.
I won't make him happy.
"That's all for now, you can go," the chief said, ending the audience, and began to look closely again at the paper he'd had in hand.
At eleven-thirty, I was summoned.
Everyone in the office was already there, and to the questions, what and how, they said, they said, that it would be good.
Only Jožin said bitingly, as was his custom, that they could not fire us all, because the comrade chief himself and his loyalists would have to do the job, and that was not imminent.
The word "comrade" emphasized, as if he knew what the old had wiped me off for.
The chief's room was a pretty reunion.
Comrade chief behind his desk and at the long advisory table by other comrades who were to decide on my clerical being or not being.
Kádrovák, chairman of the ROH, registrar from the personnel, special-professor, something like a contor in the army, and the deputy, my boss.
And the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from the trek.
An ordinary track worker, he was pining the sleepers or pitchforks to throw gravel.
But also a former guard.
It was rumored that there was no fun with him back then, a nice beast, he said.
The evil tongues said he had gone out of school in the seventh grade, learned nothing, could not do anything.
And when the crime was canceled, he ended up on a trek with a pickaxe.
But comrade, yeah, comrade was forged!
The chief motioned for me to sit down.
There was a little soul in me, an unlicenable concoction in my throat.
Kádrovák read the opinion from the citizens' committee from the residence.
I come from a working-class family, I'm married, two children, and so on and so on.
So far, so good, I thought, and I was breathing a little bit better.
Then an opinion from the party's street organization.
He copied the opinion from the Civic Committee, perhaps the same person wrote them both.
But then it came!
Parents of the party's longtime members, refused to appear before the screening committee and subsequently withdrew from the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
The cadre saw it and stopped reading.
The chief motioned to continue.
Beyond that, it was only worse.
I was a member of the SSM Municipal Committee and there I was won as the party's candidate.
Regardless of the parents who came out of the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married, and I had a wedding in addition to the national committee in church.
I have failed the party's confidence in the worst way.
That's why I was removed from among her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I baptized both children, and even gave my mother a church funeral when she died, though she was a former party member.
This is what I show a negative attitude towards the leading role of the party.
When the cadre read, only the tapping of the chief's pencil at the tabletop's plate interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone stared at me, and I wished I'd been far away.
At the same time, I kept repeating to myself, "Communists - the superhumans - the Communists - the superhumans." What did I get into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths instead?
I could repair the switches without some fucking background check.
But now?
The career of the railroad official took her to hers before she started.
Back to the platoon?
I don't think the chief will be able to do that for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you check out the comrade here?" the chief interrupted the tense silence with a question to the cadre.
Well, according to the report from a previous job.
You got him here?
Kádrovák was obviously not in two.
On the grain of sweat, he winked nervously, as if he had been vetted.
He nodded wrenely and handed the chief some paper.
"Well," the chief said with a hint of joviality, which often was a prefample of the storm.
At first glance, all the praise, trained with honours, graduated from an industrial school, worked in the taskwright as a locksmith, the standard averaging one hundred and twenty percent.
But the essentials are missing.
Where did you get the report, comrade?" he said again to the cadre, who felt that it was somehow beginning to turn against him, and that very soon he might not even be a cadre.
The comrade here gave it to me, at the entrance.
That's enough for you?
"Well, when he joined us, he went to the platoon district," the cadre babbled.
And there the assessments don't demand, his was kind of extra, so I put it in his file.
"So when you were included in the technical function this scrap of paper was enough for you," the chief said dryly.
The cadre winked nervously, and had no answer.
"Never mind, we'll discuss that later," the chief concluded, and the cadre was clearly relieved.
For now, he's stood up.
"So what about you, comrade?" the chief asked me again.
Suddenly it comes out, so that's the end!
My eyes were darkened, I was doused in the heat.
There was a flurry of reprimands and accusations, and I knew that I was the most disgusting creature in the world who deserved no mercy.
That by planting an incomplete report I misled the comrade of the cadre's officer, not understanding why the report was incomplete when I got it from the bookmaker.
I am also an anti-socialist element that, at the time of the construction of real socialism, supports the revelry of religious obscuratory, or even participates in it.
That, that, there was a lot of what I did, or maybe I would commit, and I prayed quietly that it would end.
I didn't care anymore.
I didn't care about flying out of the mechanic's position.
I didn't care that they'd take the pickaxe.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people, as I was in the eyes of the comrade chief.
"That's enough, Comrade Chief," the party chairman said suddenly, emphatically interrupting the chief's levitations.
The comrade here made a mistake, a tremendous mistake.
What a mistake, he did stupid things!
But he's already got his punishment!
Don't you forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young person than to close the door to the side for a time!
To reopen to him, he would have to prove that he had changed, that he was worthy of our trust again.
The uneducated boltter spoke like a book.
Where did he come from?
Is he so well-read or parroted phrases from partisan training sessions and meetings?
That's why this young comrade must get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who's to give it to him if not you, comrade chief?
It is your duty to support this young, true, somewhat misguided comrade in his efforts to make amends!
It's your party duty that no one can get rid of!
In fact, it's a partisan duty for all of us, too.
The comrade here must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother, she not only punishes, but also loves her.
When the chairman was finished, no one was even fainting.
No one expected such a reversal of the situation.
At least me.
"I completely agree with you, Comrade Chairman," the chief agreed on ice in an attempt to take the initiative again.
If you had me finished, you'd hear that's the conclusion I was headed for.
They all nodded in agreement, but you could see they didn't believe a word he said.
"So I was confirmed for the job of a stand-alone officer of the care of the basic means," I bellowed as I returned to my office, and then I began to cry.
Good thing, apart from the engineer Eva, everyone was at lunch.
She silently listened to my incoherent makeup of the fresh experiences, and I calmed down.
When I finished, she asked if I'd have coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put water on the cooker and prepared the mugs.
Meanwhile, she talked about the cadre practices.
As one report, often full of praise, is put in the hands of a person, and the other, in which there is any filth, they send in to a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to, but on a hike at the pickaxe, so the comrades from the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our cadre?
He just cares where he ate or drank, and that's how it turned out the way it did.
"He'll get it from the old man," she said mischievously.
He's not going to like it today.
Beware of him anyway, he's pretty vindictive.
And the party chairman?
Basically a far worse chief, no philanthropist.
Zero from a pickaxe with great power.
The coffee water boiled, and the next thing the office was filled with the scent of the just-drenched coffee.
I dropped a sugar cube into the cup and stirred the hot potion silently.
Perhaps I'm out of the woods.
Now I'm not fired, and more checks aren't for three years.
Anyway, the comrade chief won't soon forget me today.

The symbol of the village came to life.
The wheel of the windmill above Chlum is rotating again years later.
It can be seen from afar because it is located on a fifteen-metre-high mast.
People from a wide area call him "the airline on Chlum."
For the village of 150 inhabitants, it even became one of the elements of the municipal emblem, which the municipality received to mark the councillors' reunion in 2010.
"We applied for a sign at the time and of course we wanted to have a fan on the sign, everyone knows it in the area," said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlum wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is also a bit of a memento of the present: it recalls a time when the people here fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was a rarity.
It was not until 1910 that the Chlum's representatives decided to address a solution that suited it until the mid-1980s.
In the village at the turn-off to Číchov, they had a seven-metre-deep well.
Three years later, they supplemented the well with a metal structure with a wind pump that pumped the water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by the company Antonín Kunc from Hranice na Moravě with a cost of CZK 2,400," the commemorative inscription states on the ground-floor fence of the mast structure.
The pump, after several repairs and wind wheels, served in 1971.
On 7 May 1973, a new chapter in the battle for water was written: a new water main began to be served on Chlum on that day.
The wind pump remained only a dysfunctional municipal symbol and a rarity here.
The dominant feature was put into operation at this year's reunion of the natives.
It was not until 2008 that the Chlumsky decided to repair the wind wheel again and put them back into operation.
They had a replica of the original wheel made - scaled inch by a diameter of half a meter.
The bike was fitted to the mast, but that same year it had to be brought down.
The replica manufacturer did not choose the appropriate material and the bike could not resist gusts of wind.
Then the Chlumian dominance rested for several years dismantled under the roof.
But from this June on the high mast, the bike on the high mast is rolling again.
On the occasion of the rally of the natives, the village had the replica of the bike modified and re-fitted it to the top of the iron tower.
But the bike draws utility water from the well only to the pinspel of the blind shoulder.
And we disconnected it completely over the summer because there was little water in the well.
It was at least empty-handed.
"In the autumn, we will disconnect the shaft of the wind wheel from the pump in the suction basket again," Mayor Mašek explained.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where the wind bike has reached the municipal emblem, but it is the only villages of this kind in the whole of the Highlands.
They have a similar element in the emblem in honour of local technical monuments in Chvalkovice and Zelená Hora in Vyškov, in Kuželov na Hodonínsko, Partutovice na Přerovsku or in the Police in Vsetínsk.
No offense, but I don't know Lafatu, the prop for Tripoli Goian admitted.
"I remember the match against Slavia very well, and my goal, like everyone else in my career," the 34-year-old Goian smiled at the pre-match press conference.
Georghe Hagi coached us then, it was a shame we lost.
I hope to score a goal for Sparta now.
Only with the difference that we won't lose this time," Goian continued.
It is this man who played 60 matches for the Romanian national team that is a key supporter of the Greek team.
As a hitter, he will face the raids of the Spartans offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says Spartan Hybš of the Greek duel.
And he has some idea what he might be expecting on Thursday night.
I know Fataie, who played in Ardra, Romanian, with my brother Luciano.
I saw all their fights at the time.
I know he's a very good striker, that's why he went to Sparta, Goian said.
He did not appoint other Prague club footballers, so the direct question came about whether he also knew David Lafata, the best scorer in the history of the Czech league and captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled and pointedly at the Czech journalists.
The helpless look on his face indicated, "Why are you asking me that?"
After a moment of silence, he began to relish.
We've seen some videos and I've noticed that Sparta is playing a lot of team.
He's got really good players.
And Lafata?
No offense, but I don't know anyone else but Fataie.
The Spartans know that about Goian very well.
"He has experience from bigger clubs, you can say that he holds the defence of Asteras, he is kind of their organizer of the game," observed Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian has already had his best years, but he boasts a very interesting football biography.
He was interested in him at the time, Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City, but from Steaua he headed to Italy's Palermo, and played for the Glasgow Rangers.
We are expecting an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, playing European Cups on a regular basis, struggling to win the Czech league.
For me he is the favourite in this match, but we play at home and we want to kick off the group with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I am in the room with the Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košice, who is very much looking forward to his opponent from the Czech Republic.
Me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering joining the Prague Stock Exchange.
Kofola's new headquarters should be in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading in the company's shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary objective is to have the group's headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far in the project are largely legal and administrative and have no de facto impact on what is happening in the company, says Daniel Buryš, CFO of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the transfer of the group's headquarters, shareholders are considering placing shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to the entry to the Prague Securities Exchange, the company is finalising a security prospectus for the Czech National Bank shortly to be submitted for approval by the Czech National Bank.
The transfer of the holding's registered office and the related share transfers will be made in the form of a non-public transaction, with only existing shareholders participating in it.
As part of this operation, no shares will be offered to subscribe to the public or to new investors.
"Any offer of shares to new investors would be made - if the company and its shareholders so decide - at a later date, either at 4. quarter 2015 or 1. the quarter of 2016," the company said.
The firm has stated in the past that any share offer could consist of an issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of a share offering on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the location of the shares on the stock exchange.
A test of Czech Television's objectivity in reporting on the migrant crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of coverage of the main Czech media coverage of the refugee crisis.
This time, the broadcast of the main news broadcast of Czech Television.
And how did she stand?
When they teach at the Journalist Faculty about how the media can manipulate reality, they can release today's broadcast to Czech Television's Events.
The migrant crisis was devoted to about 80% of the news broadcast.
Except for the first minute, when TIME reported on the riots on the Serbian-Hungarian border and called the attacks by migrants on police officers euphemistically their patience - throwing stones and attacking metal bars), the current promigrant propaganda - judge the names of the individual stories.
Criticism of NGOs - a great deal of space for nonprofit organisations that criticise the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children at the Czech School - a story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Going to the refugees - ČT consistently uses the terms of the runner or the fugitive and not the migrant.
What is striking is mainly that in the illustration footage ČT uses consistently only and only footage of small children and women.
On the same broadcast, she herself said that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic were men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda unparalleled by communist agitators.
I have to say that as a former journalist, I am ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I once rose to the apartment block, I soon ceased to be the only resident.
The Formica toilet was moved into my fish.
Pond-fishermen's, insects with a transformation of imperfect, i.e., a non-greatening transition from caterpillar to be a beetle and a cub looks like an adult, only tiny and gradually growing.
They were disgusting to me, and I wasn't afraid to kill them.
First by hand and later by chemically.
The socialist drugstore provided some kind of blue crystals to eliminate them.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or any other way?
But it eliminated them successfully.
Later, I dealt with the pharaohs in a similar way.
A box with a kind of juvenile as the ants brought to their nest, and he then did not allow the Queen to generate new offspring.
But I digress.
As time went on, the insect became an object of my admiration, and I became increasingly inclined to think that they had the same right to life as we humans had.
In addition, I took away from my life the experience that interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success and one pest can replace another.
Truth with fleas and bedbugs I might not hesitate to make karma worse by killing them.
In the new home, my partner and I agreed that if the fish didn't climb behind our necks, let them eat their raisin' skin chips in peace, some of those invisible algae, that sort of thing.
Their calm existence was disrupted over time by the spider.
It was a common type of crib that had long been housed on the ceiling.
We thought he lived on the occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only made us more comfortable.
Having lived with us for several years, we found that he feeds mainly on fishies and that he apparently kept the number of them in a reasonable numerical state of the list.
With a confidential regular contact with each use, we found out that she was a female.
For we have witnessed romantic courtship with a partner about a third less, carefully strumming cobwebs to keep it from being eaten before reaching the desired copilations.
It took about three days when they didn't move and didn't even respond to our checks.
Beneath the toilet bowl where the love games took place, we later found the remains of the dried-out male next to the female.
Then the spider did not move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of small spiders hanging in the area.
Soon they disappeared.
They were all edited by their mother, part scattered elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
Whether she went elsewhere or off, we don't know, but after a month or two, she appeared on the ceiling again.
True, a little smaller, probably the daughter of that toiletlace-bearer.
For a time, she watched our behavior carefully from the ceiling, and by moving under the toilet bowl, she assessed our non-aggression as a friendship.
The number of somewhat multiply-mounted fishes had decreased again, and the spider was in peace to mind its normal activities to provide food.
For a year, our ecosystem hasn't changed.
Our daughter, in between, came to an age when the use of the potty was already a disgrace.
We have tolerated it so far, but the eternal pouring of its contents has already been eaten away.
We urged it more and more forcefully to use the toilet.
But the daughter, to maintain her habit, found an excuse to see the spider she saw very well at wiping.
Our talk about seeing the spider was not taken by luck in the house at all.
With a cry and a roar, she forced her potty.
It was no choice.
There was a moment when the spider, in the interest of his daughter's developmental shift, had to be ordered to.
It's on me.
It was captured in a glass and banished across the balcony to the garden somewhere.
I said goodbye to him as a friend, but I still felt as ugly after living together as long as I was firing a relative.
We assumed that the fish would start to appear more often and start to breed geometrically.
You marvel, a week, two, there was none of us there.
I began to speculate about the cause.
I wondered if the spider had somehow grown them there, following the ants, that the toilet setting was not as favorable to their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium-sized appeared, and they were swarming again.
I had to think of a different theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I discovered that their link to the spider must have been the cause of the fact that if they didn't see him, that he was hidden in some other place and that they were in danger from anywhere.
Or, perhaps they had some telepathic connection to their predator, and his quick disappearance had provoked some alarm.
All the more so because I have no illusions about their eyes.
They showed some light of shyness, but that they would react to wave their hands or quick movements, no.
My daughter already goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she's forgotten about the potty.
All that remains is to attract a spider again.
I'm already broadcasting my wishes on the air, and I hope they didn't arrest me after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use the Cyclone B.
Albert Einstein's ten statements that enriched the world.
The remarks of a brilliant scientist from the last century will probably never stop fascinating humanity.
He could dive into everything so deep that the product was always astonishing discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
He entered people's consciousness primarily with his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic affair.
It is also impossible to ignore its clarification of the photoectite or the idea of quantizing the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the descriptive and the set of findings of the popular theory of relativity is so convoluted to many that it prefers to choose easy comparisons for closer acquaintance.
But it is not easy.
Of course, it wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he didn't find a brilliantly simplified form of explanation for this, too: The hour near your lover seems a minute; a minute in a hot furnace seems to be an hour - and that's relativity.
I took the liberty of choosing from his plethora of glorious quotes to select these ten that literally captivated me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, the brilliant people try not to do them.
Only two things are endless.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not entirely sure about the first one.
No amount of experiments can ever prove that I was right.
But the only one can prove at any time that I was wrong.
But it is a sad time when it is easier to break up an atom than to destroy prejudices.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the mess of the mind, then what does the empty table reflect?
I don't know what the fights in World War III, but in the fourth one, it's the sticks and the stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and knowing much too.
If I had an hour at my disposal to handle a problem on which my life would depend, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, analyse it 15 minutes and 5 minutes by addressing it.
In the world, the most difficult thing to understand income tax.
Finally, I can't help but not concoct of the Einstein formula for the definition of success: Taking A for Success, the formula: A=X+Y+Z, where X is a job, Y rest and Z is to keep his tongue behind.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín Region are facing changes worth 1.5 billion.
"It's a success, considering that all four of them are holding in the black for the whole year," said the Governor Stanislav Mišák, aghdly.
The total profit of the regional facilities at this point is about CZK 32 million.
The share of this is mainly due to higher reimbursements from insurance companies, which are equally favourable for this year.
This fact, too, shows that, after the poor years, hospitals can finally afford to make more investments.
In Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště and Zlín, this brings to buildings that will collectively cost almost CZK 1.5 billion.
The long period of the time we bought mainly the appliances was over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because you can't do top-quality health care without them, the plans were the regional deputy for health care, Lubomír Nečas.
They look forward to the changes in all hospitals.
The builders will come to the hospitals as early as next year.
In Vsetín, they are now collecting suppliers of a new internal pavilion for almost CZK 300 million.
In Kroměříž they have a scheduled addition of dialysis.
Uherské Hradiště wants to add a new internal one for about 200 million to this year's open central pavilion.
And the Zlín Bata Hospital is awaiting the long-delayed construction of a new central reception and intern, for which three-quarters of a billion will be needed.
In all cases, these are the fundamental and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the whole region, patients and physicians," said the director of the hospital, Věra Prousková, for example, to the construction of the Vsetín intern.
The five-storey building is due to be ready in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for both internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and intensive care units.
Greater comfort for patients.
The changes, which will be significantly recognized by patients, will affect all regions.
The new buildings will be replaced by those in which, for example, many of the sick lie in one room, have even one toilet on the floor, beds are unplugsable, windows are leaking and paramedics do not have the appropriate conditions for work.
"For example, our internment was built thirty-five years ago and is now on the verge of its lifespan," pointed out the director of the Zlín hospital, Pavel Calábek.
It will therefore be replaced within a few years by a seven-storey modern building connected with an emergency reception.
Doctors and patients will thus have all the emergency departments in one place, in addition to the new premises.
The same model already has half-finished Uherské Hradiště.
The central income is already standing and there will be interning within three years.
"We will pay for the construction from the loan and partly from our own funds," explained director Petr Sládek.
It is this hospital that alone can afford its own funding in the county.
The profit is still the highest and did not make the loss even two years ago, when, for example, the Zlín hospital faced a nearly two-hundred-million-dollar loss.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we increase revenues and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," said Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
Improved will also be made to patients at the Kroměříž Hospital.
Within ten to fifteen years, up to half a billion crowns will go to repairs, new devices and reconstructions.
Already this year, the refurbished station will be repaired, then the addition of dialysis will begin, or the construction of the building for the new MRI.

No one explained to me how I should keep the refugees in the country if they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
After talks with his European colleagues, Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains that other states are pushing the Czech Republic to accept quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but reject any discussion.
He also notes that no one has yet explained to him how he should keep the allocated refugees in the Czech Republic when they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We didn't get the answer, so we wanted the quotas to be dropped from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you specifically describe the position you came up with at the meeting of the interior and foreign ministers of the European Union?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as a system that simply cannot work.
We cannot refer to migrants as sacks of salt or flour.
They're living beings who have visions, they're going somewhere, they've got some relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues how we were able to keep migrants in the territory of the Member States if they were redistributed.
We can't imagine.
We did not receive the answer, so we wanted the quotas to be deleted from the final text.
With the other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration points, border control, camps outside Europe, a trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year, and we're saying this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
We've been dealing with forty thousand not long ago, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people in that territory?
Ninety-eight per cent of all the people who cross us want to go to Germany.
Almost nobody wants to come to us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
We have the ambition to come to other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a destination country, gain asylum in our country, but the interest of the people from this migration wave, i.e. from Syria and other countries, is limit-focusable.
You mentioned that the refugees don't really want to come to us, but we've already pledged to take in fifteen hundred people.
Wouldn't it be possible to accept more of them this way?
We are committed to accept 1,500 people, but with a condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border control, military operation.
Even with the 1,500, the point is that 1100 people will come to settle the asylum procedure with.
They'll come to our detention facility, and we'll treat them the same as we've intercepted.
It is a big question, and we will debate that with Europe, whether we can detain the people who are registered in Italy and Greece, or in Hungary.
Because Europe treats this in such a way that if they have a registration, they cannot be detained.
That means they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is a deal that is not yet there, it may be that even the 1100 will not be kept on the territory of the Czech Republic and they will leave again for Germany after they arrive.
If we can detain them for the duration of the asylum procedure, we will deal with them the asylum procedure.
If it is the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98 per cent of them are getting international protection, according to European statistics.
They will then be given documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will be relocating.
This is the second project that has been underway so far, and we have only progressed there in discussing with the churches about the possibility of helping them get jobs, accommodation, and so on.
But that's a very long shot.
You said that at the ministers' meeting with us, the other states were not willing to discuss it.
But isn't it the case that the Czech Republic is merely rejecting quotas, but offers no solidarity step to unlock the discussion?
And what exactly do you think this is to be a solidarity move?
If the Federal Republic of Germany makes an incentive for all migrants from Syria to reach them, the news spreads for hours to all camps across Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It's outcropping another wave of migration that goes to Germany because they just don't want to go to us.
We think the way is to protect the external borders - simply to deter the migration waves, to help those in need, and to separate economic migrants.
They're clearly clear that they don't stand a chance.
Last year alone, fifty thousand Kosovars came to Germany.
From a safe Kosovo, where we pay for all the saturation of this state, including the police, the courts, the prosecution service.
If we could have separated them and not taken them or accept them only according to the needs of the economies, the fifty per cent of what social systems are making to them in vain today could go to the refugees.
Compared to the first day when Germany introduced checks, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
It's now eighty, the first day it was twelve.
How far is this to be to tighten border controls?
We were afraid of getting caught in the order of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have several hundred available places in the stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we deter will be returned to Austria within seven days.
We do it by default.
The Austrians are the only ones who take those people from us, with Hungary it's complicated and the Greeks - that's a completely pointless story.
So where is the tipping point?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be several hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day two, three consecutive days will exhaust our capacities to the point of contingency.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately convene a special government.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're in phone contact several times a day.
If the situation arose, the government can sit down de facto immediately and by one resolution decided to strengthen the police on the military, say, the customs administration, or the prison service.
The extreme option is the state of emergency, which has now been declared by Hungary in some places?
I don't think it can come to us this far.
Keep in mind that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen to this happening on the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread alarmist information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, we have, suggests more likely that Hungarians will try to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct trip to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be very marginally affected, almost not at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of the debts at the last minute.
It is trying to prevent bankruptcy.
Soccer Slavia paid for the debts.
Their money was also given to the footballers.
Slavia Football stood for the first time on Tuesday for the insolvency proceedings in court.
Almost three months after the proposal to be made by Online Services of Pacific Samoa for around CZK 20 million.
Slavia's attorney, Zuzana Mládková, tried to convince Judge Michaela Wenzlová within a few hours that she should not declare her bankruptcy over Slavia.
And it must be said that she made the case.
One of the main arguments was that the week before last, the new owner of Slavia was the new owner of Slavia by the large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC, as well as by Czech billionaire Jiří Šimáně.
Apparently, money from the new owners arrived at the club, at the last minute.
This is evidenced by Slavia's comments before Tuesday's court hearing - the Vršovice club sent tens of millions of crowns to the due on the day before the court hearing.
"Everything was paid for between 9/11. and September 15," said the attorney Slavie Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, the Slovak ex-representative Milan Ivan or the Czech midfielder Mario Liček.
Slavia also paid a fee to the agent, Alexander Losenick.
Already on Friday, the club paid the owed fees of the city district of Prague 10.
As a result, de facto only claims contradicts Slavia remain part of the insolvency dispute.
Either the club did not make the commitments in question at all, or they are litigated.
However, we are prepared to pay the sums in the event of a loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in a bank account, which we can prove by an account statement," Mládková, the lawyer, told the judge.
"Everything that was overdue is paid for," Mládková said, adding that unforgett or disputed liabilities are not only paid to be paid.
It is also certain that the judge will not be decided in the next few days and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had actually paid the debts in question.
Subsequently, all the evidence will be evaluated.
The decision can therefore be expected in November at the earliest.
The judge ordered the resumpt of the hearing on the third of November.
However, the decision will not be made at this meeting, but only in writing after it.

FastMig X is a representative of the latest generation of inverter welding resources.
The combination of cutting-edge technology, hardware and software integrated into the modular design brings benefits and a quick return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final set-up is always configured to the customer's requirements.
Any, from welding of structural steel to welding special alloys, as well as welding coarse materials to welding thin sheets, from appding in workshops to welding in the yards.
An incredible amount of welding curves, simple welding and expandability of the welding source makes it possible to respond quickly to a change of requirements, leading to a reduction in downtime, to the need to rebuild the resource and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables welding with top-of-the-line welding processes, developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and quality of welding.
Time is lost and there is no waste of material or the correction of faulty feuds.
There is flexibility, there are fewer downtime, more welding and higher profit.
It is this year's novelty, which premiered in Nitra, where she also won a gold medal.
We greatly appreciate these honours, as they confirm the uniqueness of the product.
Leading world manufacturers boast similar systems, but thanks to the difference in software and parameter management, FastMig X is one of the world leaders.
For those interested, the delivery times, which are around three weeks, are certainly pleasant.
In the Czech Republic, we have already established the first contacts, which will certainly be extended after the Brno trade fair.
We have been regular participants for over twenty years and our business results are almost always better after him than before him, stresses for ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, head of the Kemppi store in Pilsen.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final set-up is always configured to the customer's requirements.
Blanche was built in a way that didn't fall.
But it would cost half a billion more, says the expert at the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanche could be minted and safer, says the expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex could be built in such a way that there would be no two drops of soil in Stromovka, Prague, according to the production director of Satra, the main designer of the tunnel, Alexander Butovic.
He said it on Wednesday evening during a press tour of the tunnel.
But it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive, he says.
It will open to the drivers on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel was minted more safely, but the cost is rising exponentially," Butovic said.
The conditions in Stromovka were the same all along, he said, yet the country fell just a few steps from where it began to be minted with a safer and more cautious method.
"If the measures had been used 500 metres earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion more expensive," said Butovic.
The Blanka tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, the crater was created in Stromovka, in 2010 the land collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav, Jiří Bělohlava, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told the weekly Euro.
The building was to cost CZK 17 billion, according to the original intention.
Add to that the VAT, which has jumped twice over the construction period, you have twenty-one out of seventeen billion.
Add to that technology, land purchases and engineering activities, valorization and similar items, it's 29 billion, which isn't that far from the 37, Belohlav
Somebody ordered that and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to get a new iPhone operating system with new Apple update
The new operating system may be requested in Settings when you click on the "General" tab and choose "Software Update" ( software update).
When it is ready, your phone will offer you the option to download and then install it.

FedEx's mixed, cut for fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in its full-year profit forecast due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the land division.
The company also said it planned to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
This period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's stock fell about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx says it expects earnings to be between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year that ends next May, marking a 20 ccent drop from the previous forecast.
Analysts had expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The downgraded outlook comes by an average of 4.9 percent despite an interest rate hike, which will take effect in January. 4, and higher supplements for the transport of heavy or large parcels starting in November.
The company said it still expected profit to grow from the previous year due to cost cuts, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Board Chairman and CEO of the company, Fred Smith, said the company "supposed solid performance despite weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said it planned to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra 95,000, which is about the same as they hired last year.
In the quarter, which ended in August. 31, FedEx received $692 million, up 6 percent from last year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, predicted by 12 analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks were expected to be $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in senior international shipping in recent years, causing revenues in its Express Unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping boosted the results of the FedEx ground unit.
In the last quarter, ground revenue rose by 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same because of higher prices for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express Force recorded a higher income due to higher base rates, while profits fell in the cost of the trucking because of higher labour prices.
In pre-market trading, they fell by $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150 an hour before the opening of FedEx's shares.
They finished Tuesday with a drop of 11 percent per year and 17 percent below the record of 11. June.
At their most anticipated meeting in years, federal reserve lawmakers will spend two days seated at the 27-hit Hunt mahagon table this week, and will decide whether the time has come after nearly a decade to raise the key interest rate.
Towered above them at one end of the central bank's ornament, the two-story meeting room would be a U.S. mural.
The map is a reminder of Fed Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to give the nation's economic interests above everything else.
The central bank has a double charge from Congress: to maximize US employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term of office could be the X-factor too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday, about whether the US economy is ready to be triggered for the shutdown from an unprecedented stimulus in the form of an almost zero-term short-term interest rate on the spot from the end of 2008.
While most of the data shows solid economic growth, recent turbulence in world financial markets could already scare the Fed out of adding volatility by raising its reference rate for federal funds - or any more than just a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is obvious that the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch in the first place," Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse to not raise the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient justification to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is the cause of the jitters in the financial markets.
About half of economists recently polled by Blomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to delay the issue, with only about 30% of the chances of an increase.
This would point to a stock market decline if the Fed raises rates only if politicians soften the slump by promising that further increases are not in sight.
On Tuesday, the industrial average of Dow Jones jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,55.
The rally was triggered by the expectation that Fed politicians would hold rates off in peace this week, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would come as a surprise if the Fed raised rates now," he says.
If the Fed's politicians did, "they would have to go to the extreme in their program statement and hold hands with the financial markets so they don't panic."
Other experts said that raising rates would calm the financial markets as it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed well on track to raise the rate of 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions to confirm the strength of the US economic recovery.
Yellen said that it expected a rate hike this year over the spring and early summer, despite complaints from the Liberals, that more economic progress was needed.
Even as job creation slowed in August, the labor market has seen solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% the previous month, the lowest at more than seven years and close to the level the Fed considers full employment.
Wage profits showed signs of a lift.
And while inflation continues to run below the central bank's 2% annual target, Fed policymakers argue that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to struggle late last month after China devalue its currency.
Dow Jones' industrialised average fell to 16% below its record high in May, fearing that China's slowing economy would drag down global growth.
The market has bounced back somewhat this month, and the Dow is now only losing almost 10% of the May maximum.
Political officials at the Fed are provided by the troubled market situation with a comprehensive calculation to start-up in the interest rate hike.
"In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting," Stephen D. Oliner, senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
He now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control of the consequences.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about the impact it's going to have on the US economy, and they have almost no data to rely on about the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's main interests, so it should not technically be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
Just a hint of then-President Ben S. Bernanke's 2013 that the Fed could "enrickuge" their monetary expansion in the market was triggered by cramps around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, Fed officials can be expected to follow developments elsewhere, but are also consulting other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global wealth strategy-management at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that "Fed has a history of overreacting to financial-market movements that appear in unrelated to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee's policy-making, pushing for a rate hike, cited the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points over the three sessions "Despite the limited identifiable effects on US growth," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed the cuts.
The Fed should give priority to financial stability concerns only during a major crisis, such as the market collapse of 2008, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Rate Committee at the Bank of England.
The latest turmoil is not even approaching this level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of a rate rise because the markets have become upset," said Posen, president of the Institute for the International Economics, Peterson .
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, the Chinatown of China
The market/starred opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
It is often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's a Chinatown of China and not a Thai neighborhood.
The market/in store is the only contact point that offers a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, the popular Thai and Asian refreshments, and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is even a car part if you need a little engine oil.
The store is massive and will take you over an hour to climb through all the aisles.
If you're hungry for all this shopping, go for a meal in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The interior business stand (good, cheap) is close to the registries and has various take-out points.
What's in stock: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
In LAX-C, you'll probably find it.
Items are affordable and a lot of items are sold in bulk.
The fresh-food range includes special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruit and more.
The spread of meat is great, for example, fish - the staff on the counter will wash and the fork, even fry it for you if you so wish,
A good part of the shop is left to a massive chill section, where you will find frozen kicles leaves, a bitter melon and galangal, entire ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork gut, fish balls, regional sausages, over-the-counter semi-finished products and more.
Who buys here: Restaurant owners and chefs, also separate families and individuals.
The wide streets meet shopping trolleys and forklifts.
Find the find: Fresh monthong durian next to the cash register stand.
Where it is: The shop is in an industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounding the suburbs of Chinatown and the Centres - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While a shop can be manned, parking is usually not hard to find.
The speed on the motorways will remain the same.
Acceleration to 150 km/h was rejected by the House.
On selected sections of motorways it will not be possible to increase the maximum speed allowed to up to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
The House decided to do so on Tuesday when it agreed to the Senate amendment, which rejected the increase in speed.
The amendment to the Road Act will now head to the President.
President Miloš Zeman said at the end of April that he would veto the law allowing the 150-kilometre speed.
Transport Minister Dan Ťok (for ANO) was also against the increase, according to which the Czech motorway network is not yet built for such speed.
Speaking to MPs on Tuesday, Ťok supported the Senate's version of the bill.
The approved amendment will now allow, in line with the original government proposal, to increase the speed from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first-class roads, especially four-lane roads.
The House first extended this option to highways, which could be driven at speeds of up to 150 km/h on selected sections, but the Senate refused.
Members have now agreed to his proposal.
The senators, with the agreement of the Minister of Transport, also removed from the amendment the authorization of the traffic police to have the last word in adjusting the local roads handled by the municipalities.
The Senate version, which the House approved, also envisages that the sewerage, water supply or public lighting cables could be stored lengthwise under the road surface.
The municipalities would thus save on the purchase of the land.
Municipalities should also be required to take care of the road vegetation along local roads, regardless of the owner of the property in question.
The amendment is also intended to help improve road protection and make it easier for municipalities to deal with towed vehicles to which the owners do not subscribe.
Newly, municipalities could sell towed vehicles that their owners will not claim within the six-month period after the towing notification.
Municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight traffic through their territory on second and third-class roads under threat of a fine for freight forwarding firms.
The amendment also cancels the possibility to introduce electronic motorway vignettes instead of the existing paper ones, which will be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, this will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The Ústí ex-mayor is going to trial.
He faces 10 years of overpriced welcome to the citizens.
The case concerns the allegedly overpriced project to welcome the Citizens.
Police also wanted to prosecute MP Zuzana Kailová (ČSSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not extradite her.
According to the legal qualification of the case, both face up to ten years in prison.
The trial is scheduled for two days in October.
According to the public prosecutor, Mandík and Macík caused at least one million crowns of damage, according to the indictment.
The applicant relies on an expert report.
The former members of the city's management, according to the plaintiff, improperly allowed, in their capacity, to obtain the financial advantage of the company that organised the welcome of the citizens.
Mandík, according to the indictment, ordered the then head of the Municipal Department of the Municipal Services, Education and Culture to address five linked firms in the selection process.
When another company that offered the lowest price entered the competition, City Hall cancelled the competition.
The contract was then to be entrusted to the administrator by the city, and only Darothore entered the contest, which was then awarded the contract by the city council.
The city paid out at least an extra million.
Both accused were led by the aim of ensuring for Darothore the award of a public contract for the organisation of the Welcoming of the Citizen's event in Ústí nad Labem in the long term and in a coordinated manner have acted least in a coordinated manner with the procedure for the care of a proper treasurer, the prosecutor writes.
At the same time, according to him, they were aware that Darothore would subsequently charge Ústí nad Labem for the implementation of the Welcoming of the Citizens' event a price that would be disproportionately increased compared to the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, according to the filing, the company collected more than five million crowns for the project.
The city eventually paid out only one part, roughly CZK 1.7 million, then withdrew from the contract.
The amount paid, according to the expert's report, was at least one million crowns overpriced.
Mandik had previously denied any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this fabricated case, the former mayor said earlier, noting that the city under his leadership had only followed up on a similar project from previous years.
Between 2008 and 2010, the event was provided by Roxy II.
"It was under the same conditions, for the same money," Mandik added.
The criminals initially wanted to charge MEP Kail, who was also a member of the city council.
However, the Chamber of Deputies did not extradite her for the prosecution.
Criminals have therefore postponed the case in her case, but are counting on charging Kail after her term's mandate ends.
The welcome of the citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
The mothers received a gift check for CZK 5,000 to buy children's supplies and small gifts.
Hungarian police officers allegedly dropped a dog on the fugitive.
Then they got the press to delete the footage.
Hungarian police are said to have briefly detained an AP cameraman at the border with Serbia and forced him to delete a footage of a police dog allegedly hitting a refugee to the ground.
However, the Hungarian Government is questioning this accusation.
The alleged incident occurred on Saturday evening when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing the border with Serbia through a cornfield near the Hungarian city of Röszke.
Police officers took action against the refugees, and one of them had a Syrian attacked a dog with a basket on his nose.
The dog of the man who shouted "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," he said, Muzi says.
The fact that Muzi was filming everything was being filmed was spotted by one of the police officers and not allowed to leave.
The journalist was then not allowed to call either his superiors or his colleagues on the spot.
Officers took Muzi to a dark spot at the Refugee Registration Center and asked him to show them what he had to do.
He was then ordered to delete the footage.
Muzi thus lost the result of two days' work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP sent a letter of protest to the Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács.
In it, she described the behaviour of the police officers as unacceptable and stated that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not having to worry about the government destroying the legally obtained material.
Kovács, citing the police report, disputed Muzi's account of the events.
He said the officers just wanted the journalist to show them if they were in some of the footage, which they said they were entitled to do.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to delete anything.
"Dogs can bark - they're trained to scare off and scare a little, but they didn't attack with certainty," Kovács says.
The unpredictable Champions League.
Promotion to City kicks in, Juventus believes
"It's disappointing, I don't think we deserved to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, the home coach of the City.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League match.
Neither team made many opportunities, but we had the ball on the soccer boots for longer.
"The cause of the defeat was not in tactics, Juventus just scored two beautiful goals," said Pellegrini, whose team picked up the match after a long 636 minutes.
Last season's finalist Juventus was exactly the opposite in the standings before the clash - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, he has only a point as the defending champion and is 2-4 at the scoreline in 16th place on the table.
So, too, the turnaround at the Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, it will kick in," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three backers - Pirla, Tévez and Vidal - before the new year.
They were represented in Manchester by Pogba, Mandzukic and Morata.
"That's right, this victory is so important, hopefully we'll hit a winning streak thanks to him," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we rank among the best teams in Europe.
We were better in the second half, especially in the attacking phase.
This result is what my players deserve.
"Before our equaliser, we could have been scored at 0-2, but Gianluigi held us up," said the goaltender's manager, Allegri.
"We burned some good chances," said Yayu Touré, the City midfielder.
We have to take our experience from the Champions League and try to get a better result next time.
Goodbye, Angela, farewell to old Germany II.
Before we go on about the issue of immigrants, we should be aware that the whole media frenzy around it is run by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So let's stop by for a second.
Today, the newspapers and the media are full of the babies who are carried on their hands by their parents on the dusty roads of the exodus.
And this automatically evokes in a person - that is, a European man - a sense of guilt and compassion.
Well, they're not just the desperate little kids coming here, notice the footage of the boats landing at the Greek islands that the kids can't be seen in them that much!
Well, somehow, the pictures of the boats heading to Lampedusa, the refugees from the French border at Menton, have disappeared from the TV of the day, with thousands of young men lying around from the beautiful promenade.
Much of the young blacks.
Also, the pictures have disappeared from Callais, where these eaters and black men wait to see if they can climb through the tunnel below the La Manche.
I guess he's not moving.
Even the pictures of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans did not impress the people of Europe in any particular way.
It stuck out too much for falsehood.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it is somehow concealed that it is not only the unhappy children of Syria, but also the out-of-fashioned - for the elders: fashionably dressed - young men.
Whose musculatura look like they've just come out of a fitness center.
There's only one personal experience.
This summer, on the Turkish - Muslim - parts of Cyprus, we were lying on a private beach of the hotel.
Regardless of the fact that it was private, a large group of cars suddenly arrived at the beach.
But no hams.
And young blacks stepped out of them.
About 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30.
They entered the beach, all dressed in designer clothing and shoes. In your hands, of course, smartphones.
They were not interested in the fact that it was a private beach, and the employees - the Turks, the Muslims! - were evidently afraid of them.
They took all the deck chairs.
Whoever wasn't lying on it and just in the sea was unlucky.
They were dressed as an American rapper movie.
On the heads of the cap with a nail, white and coloured adidaska on the legs.
Then they rounded the local beach bar and feasted.
They took tables around, crammed to the sitting, swarthy and white bar guests - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled the dining terrace to somewhere quiet.
The newcomers drank beer from one-thirds - as in the US soap operas?! - threw empty bottles around them on the beach.
They were always roaring loudly at each other.
It wasn't in English, though.
Then they went to drinking wine, also straight from the bottles.
They jumped into the hotel's swimming pool - in designer swimsuits, especially the young ladies - they screamed and roared in the water, the mothers with their children and the pensioners fled in horror, and half an hour later, not a single black-and-black guest was on the beach or the pool.
They all disappeared.
Regardless of whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were even afraid to even talk about them.
The waiter said to me in a low voice in the evening, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"Yeah," I said.
"Well, they certainly shouldn't have it from work," the waiter said.
I remembered, "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had about a 20-centimeter massive cross of gold on his neck.
And the women were like a jewelry store.
"Are they drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You've seen the booze," the waiter replied.
Drugs don't wship or use it.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I could see what they were smuggling.
However, in June 2105, that was not so important to me yet.
I had no idea what was coming next.
But the Secret Service and the top politicians should have known first.
I don't think they don't know.
At the time, about 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe.
And they go and go and go.
Today, the European Union's main problem has emerged to be that totalitarian-political-correct politicians, as if the intellectuals and their associated lobbying and economically important groups have the greatest strength in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - the now publicly recognized main force in Europe - lie and lie - but not only them, the EU and television leaders, including ours.
For example, recent TV pictures about the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of pictures of Moscow's August 1968 on Moscow television.
Sure, there were a few sun-seekers at the station, but most of all - the old-fashioned - the Muslims welcomed their fellow tribesmen.
For weeks, they babbled on the news on Czech Television, as the Germans said were almost all for the arrival of the emigrants, according to some research.
Of course, who was only in Germany for a few days knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which is confirmed by other information.
For example, the famous public opinion research organized by ARD - the Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany in Czech Republic.
ARD claims, just a week ago, more than 50% of Germans wanted to accept even more refugees.
That was what our TVs melded.
However, they concealed what the next day burst in Germany: that the poll vote on the article showed that 94.5 percent of Germans no more wanted any immigrants - 67,000 people took part in the poll.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly said in November 2010, five years ago: "Our attempt at 'multi-culti's society has totally failed.'
She went on to say, "Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society."
"All efforts to live together have totally failed."
In a country where four million Muslims live, she says, a strategy has not worked to do that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without being integrated. They live with us here today, and we lied to ourselves for a while, that they would not stay, that one day they would disappear again.
But that is not reality.
The multicultural approach, where we tell ourselves that we just live happily alongside each other, this approach has failed.
He failed completely.
But even Merkel probably doesn't have the power to go up against the powerful Germany and Europe and, above all, the political correctness.
It shows an escalation of events.
The conflict is increasing rapidly.
Euroněcmec Schulz, President of the European Parliament, SPD MEP, the only one who reportedly doesn't even have a high school graduation in the European Parliament - yes, that's the one Berlusconi said in the EU Parliament that he could play a supervisor in a concentration camp - has, as he has shown up more than once, as he has.
It seems, especially under the impression of the latest statements by German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Let's note that, except for some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the statesmen of the countries that were victims of Nazism are appalled.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, the successful and solid Germans?
Who have spent years trying, at least on the outside, to deal with their terrible past of the aggressor and the murderer of millions?
Are those who say that in Germany's soul it is the devil of aggression, superiority and violence to sow?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped the efforts of the Greater Khartmans to dominate the entire centre of Europe with all his power?
When did he say that the Great-German idea would be destroyed by Germany?
I guess he did.
When it was shut down, the preparations for World War I began.
The idea of the Greater German, which led the Germans and Europe to two wars costing millions of lives, was probably returned in a different form.
After the Marxists' attempt to dominate the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, a new German ideology, on the basis of, for example, ecology, which was, by the way, one of the main ideas of Nazism, began to develop.
We'd say sunshine.
The German elites have long resisted the emergence of German nationalism, leaving in the room of all the fighters against the atom, enthusiasts seeking paradise for all, quietly supporting the old imperial and Nazi slogan Our Forest must live.
To satisfy the restless young people who want to do something differently and better everywhere, they have fully sided with the fighters against the warm-heating of the planet, stopping nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there is also a strongly anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slavic current, which considers all the Slavs a difficult vermin - since the time of Karl Marx, who, after his parents' parents, was mainly a German nationalist.
Also, as the latest statements by Schulz and the German minsters openly threatening the disobedient East states, the idea of leadership of Germany, show.
Which must be listened to without a question.
Otherwise, woe betide you!
And when we add to it that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And, as always, the capital, is behind it, especially the German one, which suits, and which is that Germany actually controls most of the states of Europe through the banks and the Union.
The pseudo-spinters of the sunshine first took the Germans to the swamps of ecology and multiculturalism, and today it brought home and will bring in perhaps millions of Muslims.
Who, who, lured the voices of the sirens, will soon hit the wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see and start to rebel.
Germany can only threaten its neighbors with force again, again a part of its population - but it seems, an increasingly smaller part - may infuse ideologically, but in the end, as always, it will catch up with it.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim hostels are on fire.
What will the German government do when the German public protests against the incoming Islamists break out?
To be helped will Muslims who have long lived in Germany, but certainly not assimilated to take over the local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when the naturalized Muslims, the newcomers and the Germans, watching the Islamization of their country, fear-mongering?
What will this do to the Germans, and to Germany in general, when the people rise up to protest loudly and publicly against the new Euro-surrounder to a Muslim?
Germany has simply changed.
The conflict that has triggered in Europe by supporting the sunshine ideology, the ideology of the elitist and essentially totalitarianism, and its greedy banks, is growing.
And because of the blunt conduct against the disobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobedient eastern neighbours, this cannot be done well.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of nosy dealers: scare them to death.
Just knock and the robust knocker has snapped at you in a way that the weaker natures may not have to withstand.
The revived head will wipe you down and drive you away, accompanying (or rather banish) the insistent seller and the animated sculpture for the journey away.
It may be a pity that a talking knocker cannot be made in reality.
Even with us, it would be useful to banish a lot of excitement and scum.
Pinked jew (Oxalis corniculata).
A tiny weed that tolerates a dry environment.
And so he's in the middle of the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant that is one of the expilcers of the weeds, but visually creates a nice impression when it comes to flowering.
Among the outdoor tiles is located.
She's unpredictable, she's doing well in our garden.
It likes a drier environment, is easy to adapt, modest and undemanding.
It creates leaves with a chaotic composition, but it is worth observing and taking pictures.
Underneath the small-scale light is the beauty of the detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with a purple accompaniment.
Rio Grande, a Brazilian pediatric company, promotes a healthy diet while breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric company SPRS came up with a shocking way to try to give women knowledge of the importance of a good diet when breastfeeding by pictures of children sucking from the breasts painted with the depiction of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give infants all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to the plethora of energy requirements, pregnant women and new-fished mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new surveys suggest that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually influenced the genetic creation of their children and protected them from developing tumours.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affected the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, though Nine's is trying to take the lead at the Today Show
The run of Karel Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to Cinema to cover the cost of the aftermath of the liberal leadership's escape failed to produce a sufficient increase in the rating for Today.
The Nine Morning Show, projected from the national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with host David Koth and Samantha Armytage, is stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This distance's a long distance, viewers did not seem so important to Aussie TV, as it scored averages at 397,000 viewers in the five major cities compared to 330,000 viewers of the Today broadcast.
Today saw a smaller increase in its ratings compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their figure was past Thursday (343,000).
Today has been filling the gap on Sunrise in recent months.
In August, it averaged 318,000 in the Today, compared to the 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the start of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise averages 349,000 viewers so far and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than just parliament this morning, my friends!

The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with former star Packed to the Rafters by Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently-vistivered father who decides to move with his two children to the seaside part of New Zealand has an average of a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson himself could pull off a TV hit without the star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result gives a clear "yes."
Seven's X Factor retained a powerful 1.136 million viewers, beating The Block (8380,000) and TBL Families (76,000) smoothly.
Seven recorded the mixed ratings of the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of the new TV quiz (from 5 p.m. to 5 p.m.), featured by Andrew O'Keefe' averaged 446,000.
The second half-hour (from 5:30 p.m. to 6 p.m.) jumped to a crowd of 623,000, enough for a small victory over Hot Seat by Eddie McGuire (6,13,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 viewers, and the second half had an astonishing 720,000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
Thanks to a drop in the second-night standings, Nine will be convinced that the Hot Seat will eventually win at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is replaced by the Million Dolar Minute, which failed to beat McGuire's show.

Three in the final, agrees that Bachelor's Sam Wood is the perfect kid - but who does he choose?
The secret revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently found out who would win Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood comes to Bachelor is shrouded in insurmountable mystery.
And the three girls who remain standing will certainly not reveal who the one is the one who will receive the rose in the end.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they inadvertently told us who would win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut until Thursday's final
All three women were singed with lyrics as to why Wood was the perfect man, quoting his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positivity as the reasons they would like to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "if she's not, which gets Wood's final flower?," their answers might have acted as a conductor about the one who wins Bachelor's heart.
As the Jeavons-Fellows, Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one that would have been best suited to Wood, in addition to them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared a light relationship since certain days.
"From the moment I entered the house and watched the energy of Sara and Sam, I felt they were pretty compatible and I still think so during the course," Jeavons-Fellows says.
"Sarah is a really earthy woman, she's a lot of fun," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They are comfortable and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood could be a nice couple.
For her, she claims to have realized during his last visits to her home that Wood might be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was no longer just a game - I opened my whole heart to him now," she adds.
I asked who Wood would choose, if not her, she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I like both girls anyway - it's a tie between Snezena and Lana.
Bachalor airs on Wednesday at 7.30 to Ten.
Originally released as the best choice for Sarah for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to launch his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his move to the United States, and a lot of teams were questioned after his brilliant start to practice at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsl, and it looks like a sensible decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, as the Australian Rengi League converts made the first kick-off from the pitch in Tuesday's 20-3 win at Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and take him into the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula was also continued to be honest in the locker room after the game.
Instead of chewing the rookies in front of the rest of the team, he was able to cheer them up.
Tomsula was also supported by Hayne publicly at a press conference after the match.
The 49ers' reporter, Cam Inman, said that Hayne also received encouragement from the special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and just take care of the next game.
Already in the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne made up for his mistake.
It certainly wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club were hoping for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught swearing when he left the field after a mistake and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy at 2DayFM 104.1 he could not imagine a worse start to his career in the NFL.
"It happens, you just focus on the next game and that's all," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the embarrassment to his original debut in 2007, when a recording in his own goal area led to Queensland's three-way.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a photo of fans holding the Australian flag on her own Instagram after the game.
Elton John and Russian Vladimir Putin to meet in discussion on gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested while pointed pistols on the Siberian runway.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, he was convicted of Khodorkovsky, his oil company Yukos confiscated and his democratic efforts curtailed.
The ÚS defended the emigrants who were seeking the property's compensation.
The pair emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, the property could not be returned, so the pair appealed to the state for damages under the Out-of-court Re-Court Rehabilitation Act.
The court first awarded them the amount claimed, i.e. over CZK 2.8 million, but the Court of Appeal changed their claim by awarding them only to CZK 90,000, referring to the fact that the amount of compensation is determined according to the 1991 price regulations.
The emigrants were defended by the Supreme Court and tapped in the amount originally filed.
But the Ministry of Finance, which was to pay the money, appealed to the CPS.
In the meantime, such a change in social and economic circumstances was that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at the time - although it was then adequate to the property being refundable in relation to the off-fashioned property - now only reaches a fractional amount of the property.
"This cannot be the detriment of the interveners as in the restitution of the beneficiaries, who have been claiming their rights since at least 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to claim the provision of compensation earlier," explained Judge-Rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk, explaining why the ÚS sided with the emigrants.
"The CPS has repeatedly spoken in favour of the general courts acting in restitution cases in such a way that any inconsistency is not interpreted to the detriment of the beneficiaries and that the purpose of restitution legislation, i.e. aton the property grievance caused by acts of the former totalitarian state, is always to be achieved," the judge added.
Evita in the musical Studio DVA will now be portrayed by Radka Fišarová.
Radka Fišarová, incidentally, became the world's youngest Evita when, in 1998 in her twenties, she starred as the wife of Argentine dictator Eva Perónová in the first Czech performance of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Timeo Rice at the Spirála Theatre in Prague.
Returning to the same role, he says, "To this day, the challenge of Evita's performance has not been matched."
Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
She was recommended for the role of the first lady of Argentina by Monika Absolon.
I've seen Moncha in Evita three times and it's definitely been inspirational for me.
Here I suddenly saw a whole new concept.
I am quite a fan of more modern adaptations, but this one is simply particularly hilarious.
"The directorate of Ondřej Sokol is original, lightweight and contemporary," Fišarová says.
The notional handover of the musical scepter between the two singers will take place at Monica Absolon's Birthday Concert on September 27 at 7 p.m. at the Studio DVA Theatre.
The evening culminates with songs from the musical Evita.
The experiences will surely include a joint duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (You will be your cries, Argentina!).
In a limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol also jumps back from the directorial desk when he takes the standings for the duration of the filming of Karel Roden in the role of President Perón.
Due to public interest, further dates were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech production of the world musical Evita is presented by the Studio DVA Theatre in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
Directed by Ondřej Sokol, the main female role was originally studied by Monika Absolonová.
Karel Roden appears alongside her as President Perón and the role of Che Peter Strenáčik.
The legendary songs by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech lyrics by Michael Prostějovsky are performed by a live orchestra under the direction of Kryštof Mark, who was already involved in the first performance at the Spirála Theatre.
4 people killed after police fired rubber projectiles at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber projectiles into a crowd of demonstrators against a draft new state constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the head of the district officer, reports that more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered outside the police station, with some throwing stones and fuse bombs.
Mr. Dhakal reports that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before they resorted to the rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he says.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles known for their ability to kill but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have clearly caused a high number of deaths.
This clash was the last week of violent demonstrations across the southern plain of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have set up a new province under the proposed new constitution and have eased their political influence.
Other demonstrations in western Nepal were also recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, which is demanding the creation of its own state.
As of August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent engagements, including 11 police officers.
when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into the provinces - a big step towards the new constitution, but a very contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted in Kathmandu this week on the draft constitution, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We're certainly not allowed to panic now.
After losing to the ice of the championship Litvínov, you didn't even manage a home duel with the hockey players of the Sparta (3-5).
Aren't you worried about a similarly disastrous entry to the extraleague as you did a year ago?
I hope nothing like this will happen again.

NHC predicts a 60 percent probability of a cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
The broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands is likely to be 60 percent in the creation of a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure low pressure system about the middle between Cape Verde and the Little Antilles also has a 60 percent probability in the emergence of a tropical cycloon formation in the next two days, added the weather forecasting man based in Miami.
Google has launched a campaign to collect $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) said it was launching a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who flood European states fleeled war-torn and poor countries. Each selected amount will be doubled by Google.
Google announced this on its blog in a very unusual way.
The news was posted on her blog by Google employee Rita Masoudová, based on her personal experience, fleeing Kabul as a seven-year-old family.
"We have travelled on many dark trains and buses and have experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear," Masoudová said.
I was lucky.
But with the deteriorating immigration crisis in Europe, more and more families, like that, are willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed among the 4 nonprofit organisations assisting refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would double all the posts made via google.com/refugeerelief up to $5.5 million.
Europe is facing the biggest wave of refugees since World War II. Most of them come from Syria, torn by a four-year war that has driven out 4 million people this year alone.
Many people are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery could be useful
The benefits of losing surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"Destal mortality data takes a long time to display," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial for a new study of JAMA surgery.
Smooth meters, bariatric surgery use different methods to shrink the stomach.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the survey was conducted in people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the weighted relationship in height, is considered to be normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values of 25 or higher indications of an overweight of a person and people with a value above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from the study since 2007 to study, which covers two types of bariatric surgery - gastrade bypass and gastronomic gastrade bypass - in type 3 diabetes treatment in type 3 diabetes treatment in people who were mildly obese.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery has fallen from 31 to 24.5 towards the end of their fifth year, according to the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who were not given surgical treatment with diabetes remained roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was solved completely in 36 percent and partly in 28 cases.
In the medication treated group, for a comparison of diabetes, it was solved in only 1 percent and in part only in about 2 percent of patients.
In addition, blood pressure, trigylcerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were also shown "in general better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's haemoglobin A1c levels in his blood, which reflects the ongoing blood sugar level in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below the level of 7 percent, researchers say.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the medication treated group, however, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glykemic control" - which is reflected in the better levels of the hemoglobin A1c - has not reduced mortality at the age of five, according to the lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrektomy group (18.7 against 14.2 kg), achieved larger declines in BMI (7.4 against 5.11 and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent against 2.1 percent) and were more likely to remise the diabetes (46.9 percent against 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show an improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from studying stronger people in Sweden where they found that surgery leads to an extension of life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, the obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had about a 29 percent better chance of surviving in the next 15 years, compared to a group that tried multiple conventional methods.
While the new study did not show an improvement in survival among post-directional patients, according to Blackstone, this is a reassuring outcome for BMI people below 35, who are interested in these procedures.
"This thesis is critical of this work here because it states that it is safer surgery in the lower BMI group," he says, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone also further argues that people and their doctors should start taking their weight really seriously after the drop in the patient's BMI between the 27 and 30s.
"I think we've been waiting for too long to be showing people the gravity of the situation," he says.
I think that once a build-up to these genetic changes, which will tightly link their bodies to obesity and diabetes, the way back is already really hard.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Lama Dalai - RT News
Europe is unable to accommodate all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that a genuine solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech in opening the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, a study of ethics, at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that under the present circumstances, humanity's interest should be placed before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response from Western European countries, however admirable it was, was inadequate to the refugee crisis in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in the solution to the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring about real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In dealing with the issues of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the George Bush actions after the 9/11 terrorist attack, claiming that "the US's violent response has sparked a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent way.
I know his motives were good, but he used the power to create unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
A four-fold increase in the number of children who have been treated by a sanitation machine in the past 4 years
Toxicology centers around the United States reported a rise of nearly 400 percent growth from 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 swallowed by an alcohol-licensed ambulance, according to the toxicology center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylorda Lopez, director of the Georgia toxicology centre, has increased the number of sanitary use in children under the age of 12 who were reported to the poison checkpoints from 3,266 in 2010 to 1611 in 2014.
"Children get to these products more often, and unfortunately, there's a percentage of the children who have to be taken to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink the remediation agent deliberately, while some want to impress their friends or as a call on social media.
Videos on Youtube show teens drinking a sanitation device because of cheap fuss.
The teenagers allegedly mixed the sanitation device with the mouthwash containing the alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive scourge of the meanschiment.
"The children do not think about this happening to them that it would hurt them," said Lopez.
A lot of more attractive (sanitatic resources) are those that are perfumed.
To be introduced are remediations with the smell of strawberry, grapefruit or oranges, which are very appealing to children.
The ambulance contains between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol.
In children in young children, several swindles can mean alcohol poisoning.
"This is highly concentrated alcohol," the medical director of the control room at the University of Kansas Hospital at the University of Kansas Hospital, Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't let a glass of whiskey be lying around either, but people leave these ambulance remedies out there, and when the kids get to them, it's a quick road to alcohol consumption.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested up to four swigs of a strawberry-scented ambulance at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the age of perpetuity considered to be drunk in an adult, according to Dr Chris Ritchey, the emergency doctor who took care of her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside the Atlanta.
Nhaijah spoke indistinct words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma because of any signs of brain trauma, because the girl fell and hit her head, Ritchey reports.
"It was very scary," Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been a mortal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or arrange for ambulance to be out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitation products were associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after the swallowing of a sanitation device containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials believed the product contained methhanol, a deadly reagent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in northern New York planned to poison their "bad" teachers by deploying antibacterial products around the room," according to the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitation and has forbidden their presence in the room.
Police assessed the thwarted plan as "innocent chatter," referring to the discipline of the school district,
Rumship: No mismatch in the Celtic team
Griffiths downplays talk of a mismatch in Celtic, while Deila admits that the Hoops are in the wrong place, but he reverses it again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson, and Warburton is worried that the new reinforcements of January will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons increase their lead over Celtic by 5 points
The first-half penalty of ADAMA's lead by Rooney gave Aberdeene a narrow victory over Hamilton in Pittodria, giving Dons a five-point lead between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths denies talk of mismatch
This situation has sparked rumors of mismatch in Celtic, which were denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates are not working under any pressure from increased surveillance in the run-up to the match with the leaders of the Dutch league.
I don't think we feel pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack of Scottish title rivalry bores Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands representative Ronald de Boer claims that Dutch football fans have lost interest in the Celtic - because there is no more rivalry between them because of the title.
De Boer, who is currently the ambassador of Ajax, states: "In the Netherlands, they no longer show the best of Celtic's matches, and why?"
Because the Rangers are no longer there.
The people here aren't just talking about the Rangers' return.
He's talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about the two teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension at the Old Company matches and it is not only the people of Scotland who are watching these games.
I turn things back to good, commits Deila.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic was stumbling a bit, but the Norwegian boss pledged to turn things back to the good.
The defeat by Malm and the subsequent outing of the Champions League was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now powered to the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "The Coffice has had a bad time and will rise again."
We now want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really, really angry or sad with the current events.
We're in exactly the same way - but we have to move on.
Really, we really need the support of Celtic because it makes the players much better.
It is very important to stay together now.
Warburton is concerned about January reinforcements
Despite comments that surfaced a few weeks ago, suggesting that he had already identified some of his January targets, Rangers chief Mark Warburton is worried about the big shopping of reinforcements and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox team.
The former Brentford boss says, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer's."
Players who come in the summer have the whole pre-season season to get in, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes there's more damage by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need to be.
Celtic Michu's transfer target suggests retirement
The Swansea striker Michu, who was associated with Celtic in the transfer window, indicated that he could retire after his contract with Swansea expired.
The 20-year-old marksman has been in trouble with a susceptible ankle for two years and has been unable to find his way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts to fight SFA for comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the locker room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card for that defender was later cancelled - the third red card issued by referee Collum, who was dismissed.
Neilson stands by his statement and states: "I did not question the integrity, I did not comment on the performance."
Griffiths pledged to avoid Tynecastle
The stubborn Hibbe was severely reprimanded after admitting that he had sung a song with a lyrics aimed at former Hearts player Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh in Edinburgh before the 2014 March Tyncastle derby
"This was a derby and it was a heated moment," the forward said, continuing: "I can safely say that I will not return to Tynecastle unless it is in a Celtic shirt."
Tannadice Council believes in the management of Dundee United - Donelly
Simon Donelly insists that Dundee United's board still believes in remedying the situation through the team's current management - but admits that the decline on the pitch must come to an end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll prepare the boys for action again," Donnelly promises.
MCInnes is happy for the 'ugly victory' against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to hold desperately against Hamilton Accies to win a seventh consecutive league victory and a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to a penalty from the first half in Adam Rooney's serve.
McInnes says, "There is no team that has won anything, either cups or leagues, without winning this type of matches."
Scottish unemployment remains unchanged as UK overall unemployment rises
NON-GAMMANNANOST in Scotland remains unchanged at 164 000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed UK has risen by 10 000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above the UK rate (5.5 per cent), as shown by data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over a three-month period, with the number of workers now halting to 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell said in a commentary on the latest figures: "The government's long-term plan has laid the groundwork for a stronger economy."
It is almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we saw further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment was rising while unemployment was falling.
Why I witnessed an execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I will be watching the man's death.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in the viewing gallery in the Oklahom State Prison death chamber and see Richard Glossip, who will be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four officials witnessing his death.
I received the invitation first in January through my best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day gets closer, I'm starting to get scared of it.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to monitor executions in America and, as there are often more requests than vacancies, a morbid lottery is being carried out to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of posts for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will be watching the entire execution unbiased.
I can't do that.
I will sit alongside Richard Glossip's closest friends and establish a special bond with him through the months of phone calls and one-two-and-a-half-hour visits.
I like that kid.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The Prison Administration says I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to comment block and I won't be able to record what I'll see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the inmate's story the way it likes, get access.
I was complaining about it.
She admitted that "she could have phrased it better," but still she thought what I was doing was wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help the march against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, the Huffington Post journalist, will be by my side.
To know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I have created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would have found him guilty of complicity in a crime.
But I believe there is a good chance that he is innocent of the murder.
I firmly believe that not enough evidence was provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, the execution is wrong.
And it is from this perspective that I will follow his death.
I can't say I'm going to be really objective.
For this purpose, you can contact other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the person I love, to die an unnecessary death.
Man escapes Canning River after police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after he freed the man from the Canning River.
The bet of the man from Petrh that he would run away from the police did not work out after he got into the shallow muddy water only a metre from a policeman who tried to persuade him to return to shore.
Police from Canning Vale were called in an incident spanning Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping across the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He was standing in the water and repeating I'm not going to go out, just come for me," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhacavec didn't exactly want to soak his uniform, so he tried to use safer tactics and the police negotiations."
'People sometimes try to do funny things when they escape,' said Castledine.
Socceroo champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, the Cousins drove his car into a ditch to avoid a bus and try to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were in vain, but he inspired the locals to start planning Ben Cousins' biathlon.
Peter Moody claims the organizers tried to spy on him and threaten to end the races
Peeter Moody accused Racing organiser Victoria of trying to get a spy into the stable last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He focused on the organizer and integrity department of Racing Victoria, he was based on the belief that they had a late-cracked Serbian campaign against him with Lady Tatai's late-scratch on maintenance day, which was the last straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation when it came to Lidar's positive swab for cobalt, which he could not explain.
He bit the language about the espionage charge for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it all comes out of you at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you respond and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home today and get a good night's sleep.
I want to walk with my heads up and the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
If they start to think otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach.
I'd have to consider doing my license afterwards.
Previously, Moody launched a bomb in his race-line.com interview that the integrity of the department had tried to spy on him.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart was in the room with the man - whom I will name after the question - and offered him a job at my stables for finding out about the things that are being done in my stables," Moody told Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, they should all show their information, because they've completely burned me in an attempt to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former RVL chairman, David Moodie, current chairman of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of this today.
Should I think this is becoming a personal matter?
Will the RVL grow up with a few spheres and arrange for people outside of the coaching positions to take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think they do.
Maybe they need to take away my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will give them the material to think about.
But I got to a point, if I don't care, and it makes me sad.
It really made me sad.
I will push them and pass on the burden to them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The coach's frustration levels had been raised with a long-term investigation into cobalt, including Lidari, and a recent scratch to make him feel "for hours of your license on the table."
Mood, best known for preparing undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the treatment rule on the race day "ridiculous" after a clay or mud was applied to the horses' feet, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I must take full responsibility for this," he said.
Someone on my team accidentally applied mud to his leg.
He could've had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it did.
It happened on race day.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for treating the tiles on the day of the race, to which the organizers had already opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need the rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobram driver who fled was arrested
Police arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend and drove off after a collision.
The cyclist was flown to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the main road of Murray Valley on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist had left without stopping and helping the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia confessed to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with unstoppable accidents, failure to render assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back at rivals over wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, Melbourne Storm's coach, criticized the saves of his players as "setting the plan" by two NRLs favoring premiership.
Trent Robinson, coach of the Sydney Roosters, said the referees allowed the players to "receleigh" his players during the Storm team's controversial victory in the Sydney Qualil Final on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly veiled note to Stror after his team won the North Queensland Cowboys Qualory Finals on Saturday night when he called the game a "sightseeing" of the rugby league and, according to him, two of Queensland were not "too big" on wrestling.
Bellamy defended the saves of his players and said they concentrated on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation has boosted his confidence because his team is being criticised by two leading coaches, which may mean they are afraid of a defeat by the Storm team.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we were beaten 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed any of our defensive system and techniques in the last year, the last few weeks we've only put emphasis on contact during the interventions, and that's a turning point for us.
Trent's been here for three years and he's obviously been coaching a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how such things always come up in this one of the seasons.
Bellamy devalued Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetov's team, St.Illawarra Dragons, won the premiership in 2010 by playing "borne" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He was right about his Saturday play being as exciting as ours. It was also just as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010, St. George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said at the time that he didn't give a damn.
But now he has a team that can play a style of play that seems to him to be canceling, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
You would like to play such football if you had this type of player at your disposal.
He said that view in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his style of football - but not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It gives me more confidence because they say things like that because they're worried about the fight against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got to the big fights.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that there were more goals in the Storm and Roosters game than in the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I didn't look, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are breaks and no-shows to try it interesting?
I think it's the agendas.
If we are mentioned, it means that we will definitely meet again at the stage.
Storm are on a break this weekend and have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cownboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final the next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Serbian man gets $200,000 bail for drug charges
A man facing a possible life sentence for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine that had been smuggled out of Queensland received bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic (29 years old) was one of five men arrested by federal police last month searching for 100 kilograms of a drug from the yacht Solay, who arrived from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was spotted in a meeting with the accused together at the port during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential sentence for holding commercial cocaine, Maksimov's lawyer set up the defense on the fact that there was no evidence that he owned the entire quantity and that he could be in the cafe completely by accident and innocence.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan believed that Maksimovic would flee.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Mother and stepfather Maksimovic collectively offered a bail of $200,000 for his release.
"After reading the sworn statements of both individuals, it is clear that the deposit of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
Their efforts themselves were clearly insufficient, as the accused did not appear further in court, he warned.
Maksimovic has been granted bail on the condition that she renounce both the Australian and Serbian's passports, report to the police on a daily basis and observe a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure paedophiles to send pictures
The paedophile used the 11-year-old girl's phone to get pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl's phone while she was sleeping, then logged in to her online chat, where he had a lot of indecent photos of the children sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up and found her phone missing and then found it in her hand sleeping Hogg.
She went through it and found disturbing news before alerting her mother.
Police took part in and saw five photos, after which the analytical computers found the address and discovered "disturbed" searches on the web using expressions for finding naughty pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officers that his reason was to "take the pedophiles" online before he "pretended that he was a police officer and frightened them."
Fisk representative Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to people scaring.
He admitted that he did the computer searches, but he claimed he only wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send more.
According to him, he did it to lure them in
He claims he went crazy drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added, "When the girl found the messages on her phone, he called his mother, shivering and crying.
She saw the naughty pictures on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interviewed and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to speak to girls who looked much younger than he.
Hog, 23, while residing in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to suing for the adoption or provision of inappropriate images of children 14. June last year, he violated the bail conditions on January 25 and did not appear for a court hearing on 24 March of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the list of sex offenders because he can argue that there was "no major sexual overtones" in his actions.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the ruling to October for filing a social worker report.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was kept in custody before hearing about the other unresolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sex offenders before the date of his judgment.
Zimbabwean's Robert Mugabe gave a bad speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, had earlier fallen on the steps leading up to the stage this year.
He was not injured, but the video of his fall went viral in social media.
The opening of the parliament was also tainted by opposition legislators' claims that they had received anonymous threats of killing that warned them against the whistle of Mr Mugabe during his speech.
He was booed and provoked last month during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he reiterated on Tuesday.
The chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones with a warning not to obstruct Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The report comes from a number that will not appear, but is named 'death'," he told the journalists after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends up in parliament and, once they step out of parliament, their parliamentary immunity is not working.
The chief said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about threats against MPs.
Hewlett-Packard is set to cut his job by as much as 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard the abolition of 25 000 to 30 000 jobs in the context of its efforts to restructure and save the cost of the company's commercial services.
HP will later be divided into two listed companies later this year and will separate the computer and printer business from its faster growing operations of corporate hardware and services.
The expected job cuts will result in a change in the range of about $2.7 billion and start in the fourth quarter, HP says in a statement.
"These restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, CEO of HP and Chairman of the Board of Directors, who will head the unit after the split.
"The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a wide and extensive business portfolio to help businesses move to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As a separated company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have a company's declaration of an annual revenue of more than $50 billion and "will be aimed at providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions" to companies.
This will set up a company set up by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, the electrical equipment graduates from Stanford University in 1930, and whose garage at Palo Alto was dubbed the "Romaliicon Valley bridesmaid."
HP was undergoing a massive reorganization to manage the move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technical firms in America, is the latest in this sector based on the belief that a narrowly specialized firm has better results.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must get past injured Jack Wilsher ahead of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilsher that it is still only glowing and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason not to play again at Christmas.
This best-scheduled scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four English games and, from the point of view of history, his involvement in the next European Championships, is clearly uncertain.
The great pity of this newest problem is that Wilshere ended last season with an ankle injury in the strong end and then got back into his former form during the preseason.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," says Wenger.
It's a wound that requires healing.
This is nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It was not about his ankles or injuries he had sustained before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, as Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
Here, too, there is an unpleasant pattern.
The survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. has recorded 23 different Wilshera injuries since he made his game debut six years ago.
During the past five years, he has played in only 65 league games for Arsenal, out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08 he was one of two Premier League clubs to lose the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the vicious circle, but Arsenal believe that the improvement in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back from injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time to strengthen your body and get a competition," Wenger says.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will and will have a career he deserves.
Arsenal begin their campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb's matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur the next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
"I try to maintain my balance and let the players in need let it out," Wenger says.
Although Arsenal are the clear favourites to advance from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation for the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also not beaten in a total of 41 matches after they kept the "non-match" campaign last season.
The stadium rocked on Wednesday night with a high-level 3.2-meter-tall Richter earthquake.
That was the 10th year in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks that Arsenal have learned their lesson from last season's Champions League, when he capitulated against Monaco and is left with a distant hope of leading the club to their first European Cup victory.
"This dedication is enormous," Wenger says.
Arsenale never happened.
We were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I have to be a realist.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us a serious lesson about male friendship
The absence of such views on various shows is blatant, especially given the need for men to open up more desperate than ever when it comes to suicides among young men under the age of 15.
In 2013, it was the only largest cause of death for men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men as in women.
In an effort to address this problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) identified 2015 as the Man's Year, which aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help if needed.
In the heart of this struggle lies the friendship for fulfilling this challenge.
A recent study by more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the victim had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, the circle of sinsincious, sender of seniors is half the chance of occurring in mental health problems.
But for friendship to work, of course, it must be attainable first.
In this communication through social media with an emphasis on style and not the content of the message, the immediate answer is often favoured over meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more loving and more successful has doubled our need to look like fun, even though we are more isolated in reality.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social condition, everything at the expense of our true values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound effect on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire and gamemaker recently explained, money doesn't really buy better luck.
The beauty of Friends was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, who shone through a friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, the moment of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross's lust for Rachel, all stemming from the realization that, yes, men can also identify with it, even if they mostly keep their feelings for themselves.
as a Samaritian worker explained to me: ..."my role as the listener of people who feel depressed or suicidal tendencies have indeed confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old adage of "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up to the problems.
Friends are one of the shows that arise in my memory when I try to offer a longer-term settlement mechanism.
He emphasises the small moments in a man's friendship.
As for my task, the state of the outsider on the phone helps people in moments of desperation, but long-term support has to come from a larger near, from a network of friends and family.
So if you're going to FrendsFest this weekend, hosted by Comedy Central Station, why not take your friends for a drink in Central Perk, where the interior will be completely redesigned to celebrate.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and say hello to him.
You never know the difference your friendship can make.
Friends will air on Comedy Central from start to finish - a full 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored to help PSG sweep Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring a goal against Malma.
Angel Di Maria scored on his debut in the Champions League to help PSG beat Sweden's Malmo team on Tuesday.
Here's the news of the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's game and Paris Saint-Germain started their journey in the Champions League with a final comfort victory of 2-0 against Malmu at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored the goal less than four minutes after his debut in the Champions League and that PSG player sent the French champions to win, but then threw away a few chances until they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored a head-to-head goal in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, which is why the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they focus not only on qualifying for the knockout rounds, but on improving their path to the quarter-finals, which they have recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they scored three points, it was not the classic performance of the Laurent Blanca team and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was martened in front of the goal and was later replaced against his home team and club, in which he began his famed career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win away in the Champions League at home, so a 2-0 win gives our opponents a problem and look comfortable in defence is a good start, even if there are things we will have to improve with the season progression," said Blanc.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, yet I regret not scoring one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury as one of the three changes to the PSG team, which drew 2-2 at home this weekend with Bordeaux in the League, but was eclipsed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was identified as a man who would move PSG to a new level in Europe after last month's transfer from Manchester United and showed why, when he ran to the Marco Verratti's pass for the defence of Malmo and with a beautiful finish sent the ball behind Johan Wiland to the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected it to kick-start a spectacular victory for PSG, they had to be disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the playoffs to reach that stage, came on with 9 internationals in the starting line-up and five defenders, and two overturned midfielders were a tough opponent.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjica, who just missed the far corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, PSG themselves took the fallout from the attack with poor passes and a lousy finish that was not good even from Ibrahimovic, who failed to shoot five times in the first half, and was then disappointed as his shot was slammed into the net shortly after the start of the second half by Cavani.
However, he proved much more appropriate when it came to the preparation of the chances for his teammates and it was from his pass that Di Maria sent a spinning shot that ended in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after the hour of play thanks to Cavavim, this Uruguayan header sent his sixth goal over the line this season after Ibrahimovic passed it on a pass from the left flanker from Maxwell.
This ended all of Malm's thoughts about the possibility of making something of the match, and only a brilliant save by Wiland from close proximity to David Luiz's hope was ruined and the score remained unchanged even when the goal of reliever Ezequiel Lavezzi was not recognized at the end of the game.
The team's coach, Malmo Age Hareide, admitted to the fact that PSG were a class above his team, the Norwegian said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not on the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
For them, it was a fascinating match.
Glencore made $2.5 billion for stock sales
On Wednesday, the mining giant Glencore, based in Switzerland, which was hit by the collapse of commodity prices, made $$2.5 billion on Wednesday from its large-scale plan to reduce debt.
Glencore says in its statement that it has sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to repay the debt.
This company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is facing a reference to commodity prices as China's slowdown in the economy is reducing demand and sparking destruction across markets.
The issue of rights sent Glencore's share prices to the top in the London stock market in early morning trading on Wednesday.
The shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened up 0.69 percent.
Glencore revealed last week that stock sales worth $2.5 billion are part of broader plans to reduce their $30 billion debt, which has accumulated by about a third
The company sold the new shares at 123 pence per share, marking a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
They got rid of 1.3 billion shares, at a total price of 9.99 per cent per group.
Concerns over the extension of the brakes on the rise of the Chinese growth have cut the price of iron ore by nearly half and coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
White House confirms Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the US at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in its Tuesday report.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to Barack Obama's visit to Beijing, where the president visited in November, the report said.
US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his spouse, Peng Liyuan, to a state dinner to be held after the talks.
"President Xi's visit is an opportunity to strengthen relations between the US and China and urges cooperation to address the challenges of international, regional and common interests, and is an opportunity for a constructive debate on the two states' disagreements," the report adds.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he will meet with several US technical leaders on his way to Washington and then resume to New York for the September UN meeting.
Obama and Xi are expected to address contentious problems, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyberespionage and its mounting aggressiveness in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis shattered the Schengen area.
The rude flare launched by Germany has far from piled up European garrison, but is already forcing the ship to change course, French daily Le Figaro reported.
The European Union decided on Monday to tackle the problem of refugees first: it will be more systematically sorting migrants and asylum seekers as soon as it sets foot on the old continent - especially in Greece, rather than arguing over the future distribution of refugees according to quotas based on the quantities, which are increasingly moving away from reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, the interior ministers of the Member States changed the priority.
Rather than taking care of the final destination of the refugees, it is first necessary to filter out those who are arriving today and to resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential to manage migration," the text discussed by the ministers in Brussels stresses in a text discussed in Brussels on Monday.
Following the common currency crisis, the EU is finding that it is in jeopardy in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it is not losing its resolve and increasing pressure.
It is restoring border controls, particularly with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those seeking asylum in the country.
The central power is making it clear that without it, no free movement is possible in Europe.
It has already served as evidence that Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, albeit with varying degrees of intensity.
Hungary did this a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permissible under the Schengen rules.
That this is a domino effect is also seen by the blind.
A key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, in southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already passed inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière discussed this intensively during a private interview with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is tough.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of newly arrived refugees have already been registered and identified by fingerprinting.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point on its territory because it is more afraid than others to keep camps on its shoulders in which the refugees would accumulate on its behalf.
Greece remains the real black hole.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, twice as many as have arrived in Italy recently.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing through overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge gaping hole.
Athens, which are still in financial disruption and awaiting a new government, have folded their hands in their laps.
This is the starting point for the Balkan trip and the source now common to worry for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission promises to be introduced as soon as possible, but has not given any number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece apply to the whole of Europe," the EU interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilise on the front.
It is therefore a question of deploying the intervention teams of the European Border Control Agency in this country, Frontex.
The EU wants to help Greece to expand its reception capacity for asylum seekers and strengthen the surveillance of the islands.
"Afghteal financial resources will be needed," the text submitted to the ministers for approval warrants warns.
From a legal point of view, Athens will continue to have the last word.
The issue of the creation of real European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is coming close to that.
The new emergency situation of the 28 has, as well as pushed back to the second rail, the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, which was raised by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament earlier in the year, strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They see it as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was maintained on Monday in a text approved by the majority of the 28.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm pledge includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees in the next two years, as already reached in June during the hectic EU summit, concludes Le Figaro.
Seven dead under an avalanche in the Alps, including allegedly three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists who were killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
German nationalities, according to the authorities, are also the only survivor of the afflicted group.
Previous media reports indicated that it was Polish.
A woman in her 30s with a serious leg injury to her femur was hospitalized in the town of Briancon.
The dead were mostly 40-year-olds, according to AFP.
"The rescue operation is over, the bodies of the victims were also taken for identification to Briancon," said the prefect of the department of Hautes-Alpes, Pierre Besnard.
The accident happened around noon in the Pelvoux mountain region below the top of the Dôme de Neige des Ecrins mountain, measuring 4015 metres.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a metre high," said the rescue chief, Nicolas Colombani.
The group of eight, according to him, was pouring in a huge amount of snow at the height of about 3900 metres.
The weather service did not warn in the area today before the weather.
Trengove before the Braga match: Finally, the real Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trpišovský, in his Championship in the cups, managed to make it through the Europa League to the group stage with the Liberec players and is now looking forward to enjoying the right Europe with the team.
The Slovan will welcome the 2011 finalist Braga to the start of the main stage of the competition and, according to the coach, he wants to impose his playing style on her.
After all the nerves in the knockout stages, when every goal and every situation could knock you out on the way to the dream group, now we are there and we will play six games.
Of course we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every goal we've scored, we can play our tactics and we're not bound by a pair of just a double-header.
"I am very much looking forward to it and it is a true Europe, before it was only a qualification," Trengove said at a press conference.
Braga is considered the top team.
They will be very active, with all the Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good on the ball.
The opponent may just be harder just because he doesn't have that name, but he does have a player in his cadre who, I suspect, scored three goals for Manchester.
"He is an excellent team-level team," Trpišovský said.
He does not consider Braga a clear favourite.
I take it we're playing at home, so we're not underdogs.
"I think we showed in the domestic competition and in the preliminary rounds that we are strong at our stadium and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team lost only the opening Super Cup in Pilsen from 11 duels this season.
He believes Liberec can impose its style on Braga.
We have a team coming up that will be strong on the ball, at the same time it is uncharacteristically disciplined for them.
They play from a 4-4-2 set-up with a quick transition to the offensive phase.
"He's a very tough opponent, we've discovered the weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players do it on the pitch," Trpišovský said.
We studied our opponents a lot in the pre-season, which helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, to which we adapted the training sessions.
"And we definitely want to, although it will be very challenging to play according to our notes," the coach added.
Student films will dominate Písek, the international festival begins.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries have entered their works this year for the 15th International Festival of Student Films in Písek.
Four dozen of them, sent to the final by a committee of students and educators, will be screened from 15 to 18/18 will be shown. October at the Portych Cinema.
The best of these will be chosen by an international jury, said festival spokesman Jakub Charvát.
Each year, the festival has its own special theme, which is based on the festival's theme song.
This year, she's a detective story.
The director of this year's gala evenings, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre.
"And of course we also need to solve the crime that was committed in our trailer this year," said Charvát.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of the student's work - films of fiction, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by an international jury, such as last year's winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
As every year, the festival organizers prepare an accompanying programme.
Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ondřej Smeykal, turbošansonová group Poletíme?, playful band Zrní or, for example, Petra Hapková with a recital Life at the Bar.
The festival will also host two exhibition of photographs.

Our school and the festival are his legacy that will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences with each other and develop joint ties and film craft," the spokesman said.
This will certainly be helped by the Pitching forum, where students can meet film professionals, complete several job-seekers at the same time and get a job.
The festival is associated with the creation of the Private Higher School of Film in Písek.
Its founders, husband and wife Vladana and Miloň Terčovi, organised their first year in 1997.
It was held once every two years until the sixth year.
In the bankruptcy of TA, the insurance companies are to cover the clients' claims in full.
Insurance companies should cover the full amount of the travel agent's claims for the travel agent's bankruptcy.
This was decided by the House on Wednesday when it passed a modified amendment to the Tourism Business Terms and Conditions Act.
Travel agencies will be able to replace bankruptcy insurance with a bank guarantee, according to the draft, which is headed for consideration by the Senate.
Insurance companies with the obligation to pay for clients' claims even above the agreed limit disagree.
The Ministry of Regional Development insists on the adjustment, arguing consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end the insurance of travel agencies against the crash when the amendment applies.
But the proposal has also been criticised by travel agents.
They will either have to quit or go abroad without insurance.
Minister for Regional Development Karla Šlechtová (for ANO) pointed out that the cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation were not Eurocomform.
She drew attention to this year's Constitutional Court ruling, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to set the right limit, stressed Šlechtová.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have a limit to be feasible," said TOP 09 Vice-President Miroslav Kalousek.
The bank guarantee, according to him, will not work because no one will give it unlimited.
"Tour offices will have to close or move their activities abroad," Kalousek warned.
Member of the Presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies, Tomio Okamura (SPD), disagreed with Kalousek's concerns based on a survey of member CK.
"Stop showing us lobbying the insurance companies," he said.
The insurers' observations are not considered relevant by Okamura, there is no official written statement of which in that sense, in his view.
But they are said to be looking into whether the travel agencies will take part-time, which Okamura says is not a problem.
Jana Fischerová (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the competing Association of Travel Agents of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who talked about the deletion of the stairs to Czech travel agencies, also warned against the provision.
Travel agencies, according to Fischer, will not be able to take out the insurance.
"Consumer protection is working," Fischer says.
Her motion to delete the disputed passage was not approved by the House.
Neither did Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) with a proposal to return the draft to the committee because of the alleged violation of the Civil Code.
Filip drew attention to the travel agencies, which he said could threaten consumers.
In the light of the verdict of the Constitutional Court, the rapporteur of the draft, Martina Berdychová (ANO) withdrew her proposal, which would limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not have known that the insurance benefit would not cover the entire risk.
The amendment will not initially propose a minimum fourmillion-dollar insurance limit for travel agencies offering airline tours and a million-dollar limit for offices selling, for example, bus tours.
The threshold will remain at 30 percent of the planned revenues from the sale of the tours.
However, the insurance benefit limit will have to be such that in the event of the travel agent's bankruptcy, it will cover all customer claims.
The standard, even after the modifications, stipulates that travel agencies will have to newly mention for the sold tours, which tour operator is organising.
Travel agencies will have to submit to insurance companies before the conclusion of the contract, including data on the management and the number of tours.
The approved amendment to the Public Accounts Committee also envisages further regular information on insurance companies.
Travel agencies will have to supply them with details of the number of passengers and trips sold each month, the total price of the trips sold and the amount of the advance and sales of the trips and for vouchers.
If the Ministry of Regional Development finds that the travel agent has failed to fulfil one of the legal obligations to the insurance company, it will call for a remedy, or be able to prohibit it from entering into new contracts in the event of a breach of the obligation to jeopardise the interests of customers.
The amendment is also to re-align the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Regional Development will determine the amount of the grant to the mountain service on the basis of its application, which it will be submitted until the end of April for the next year.
The application will include a report on the use of state money last year, a financing plan of expenditure and an outlook for the next two years.
According to the association, the petitioner of the law, however, did not think through the situation of what would happen if the insurance company terminates the CK contract.
It will not be allowed to hold tours, and clients who purchased the trip before the insurance is terminated will lose it, according to the association.
The TA will suffer a significant loss in such a case and may even go bankrupt, even though its management was in good shape.
One of the ways in which travel agents can cope with such a situation will be to the state's claim for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad, and we will only act as agencies in our market, said the association's vice-chairman, Jan Papej.
The draft amendment also includes the institute of banking guarantee, but so ill-considered that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, as the bank guarantee cannot be readily at an unbounded amount.
Moreover, according to the association, the change in past practice is de facto unnecessary.
Within two years, the whole law will need to be recast again, given the new EU directive.
A total of 942 active insured travel agencies operate on the Czech market.
This year, only three TA services have ceased their activities.
Domestic travel agencies sell trips worth around CZK 20 billion annually.
Merkel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must work to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon to limit the arrival of refugees in Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after talks with the German provincial prime ministers.
At the same time, it again appealed for the distribution of refugees who had already arrived in the EU among the 28 member countries.
We must do more to help the countries from which the refugees leave, or in which they are staying after leaving the country.
I am expecting a signal from the European Union that we will work for decent conditions in refugee camps, such as in Jordan and Lebanon, the German chancellor said, according to which such a signal could also be higher financial assistance or closer cooperation of the EU with international humanitarian organisations.
"Federal countries are also supporting the German government to promote a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis to European countries," Merkel said.
In this context, the country's Prime Minister of Brandenburg, Dietmar Woidke, said at a press conference that he expected real solidarity from all EU states.
The distribution of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas has long been rejected by the Czech Republic, among others.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke in favour of speeding up the asylum process in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible whether they have a chance to stay here.
It is also needed for the authorities to start integrating foreigners more quickly, the Prime Minister of Brandenburg said.
According to him, it is also necessary for the majority of the money that Germany spends to care for refugees to be used precisely to integrate those who have a chance of obtaining asylum.
More teachers will be needed for the refugees to master German.
It is a great challenge for our country, but I believe that if the refugees can be integrated, they can become an asset for us, he said.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in film
Matt Damon confronted the African-etamount filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity, claiming that it was not necessary behind the scenes.
During Sunday's episode of the HBO project, the actor, booked in the series, was interrupted by an actor casting for the Brown series, emphasizing the need for alternative views about the black protagonists in the script.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it by casting a movie and not when casting a show," Damon says.
Shocked, Brown reacted in scandal with disbelief, and sighed "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments about the Martian made it to the air.
Damon and Brown teamed up with joint well-known producer Ben Affleck and brothers Farrell to discuss the show's finalists.
"I'd like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they will treat the character of Harmony," Brown said at the outset.
The only black character that's a hooker who's packed with a white pimp.
The producer of Drama the White People championed the finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon retorted that their director "would eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disparity with Damon's comment.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at writing the clip, "Matt Damon interrupted the only black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that the diversity is SOWHERE that it hurts."
The tweet has garnered more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 Liquor since it was released.
Damon's comment comes as the exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After being killed by teenage Michael Brown as a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took up a national effect and pressed the makers of the laws and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against colorful people.
In February, the singer Prince made allusions to the movement while the nominees for the Album of the Year category during the Grammy Awards.
"Alba is still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
Most recently, the leader of the Black Lives Matter movement presented the statement in response to a question from Fox News, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," the supervisor said.
Damon was recently reported to a list of entertainers, producers and media of moguls who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the west.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope is unclear.
"American Ninja Warrior has the first winner"
The professional climber and busboy Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday to take home one million dollars.
In the competition, which had just finished its seventh season, none of the contestants had managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During the final of this season, two men made it to the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last hurdle was a 30-second climb for a more than 220 m long rope.
Britten graduated from the climb first, within the set limit, becoming the first contestant to surpass the debauched 4 in the American Ninja Warrior, however, with Caldiero beating it by a full three seconds and winning the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview for the news! News right after his hard-earned victory and it was clear that he was still in shock at the $1 million prize winnings.
"It's an amazing feeling, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life," Isaac E! said in response to his winnings.
"So suddenly . . . I can't imagine what it's going to be like now."
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview with The Hollywood Reporter about the run-in and why Britten would not receive any reward despite the fact that he became the first contestant to complete the track.
According to the rules, the money belongs to the one who finishes the track the fastest.
"If more competitors take part in the track, the one with the best time will win," said Weed.
Even if the gain of the main prize would change his life, Britten is happy with his performance.
"I don't think he has a grudge.
He's glad he's managed to get what he's accomplished.
He received a warm welcome from the fans.
He's a great guy and he likes his family.
He's a hero to his children and his wife."
Geoff told me, "If there was someone who could have beaten me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think if I could win, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with the eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers only walked just past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the Detroit Tigers, the second half of the season was not exactly a walk in the park.
The Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, are now in the bottom of the central division of the American League.
They narrowly averted their defeat by the Tigers, beating Minessota with a narrow 5-4 result at Target Field in Tuesday's game.
The twins missed the chance to approach the Houston Astros team and captivate the second wildcard in the American League.
Even for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the speech to Z, which was so elusive for them during the second half of the season.
"Winning is always fun, and it doesn't matter what way," said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon kept his offensive roller opener, and Detroit scored three times in the first two innings and then took another in the sixth and ninth inning.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponent 6 1/3 of hits and 3 runs.
It was only his third consecutive game in his last nine games.
"I want to finish this year with convincing results," Simon said.
"It's hard to get into a match when you're often on the bench and that's why I want to get really into the game."
Tigers' Pálk Victor Martinez scored three shots and made 2 runs and his first drawn point since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first three-point game since the last game in June, scoring four of his match against the Seattle Mariners.
"He leaned in nicely," Ausmus said.
"He looked good at practice, batted noticeably better and managed to bring it into the match."
With three runs at the end of the seventh inning, the Twin Towers won the best chance to return to the game.
The centre-runner Byron Buxton took the swap thanks to two points on the left side of the field.
Real fielder Aaron Hicks scored a point with a set-up bat, and Simon chased out Brian Dozier before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy knocked out his only opponent, Mauer, and he had a batsman, Miguel San, who hit the ball and ran around two bases, leaving right-handed Drew VerHagen behind.
With two players on the scores and a second-inning chance to draw in the second inning, VerHagen managed to send the third-seeded sweeper through two bases.
Plouffe has already won 27 runs over two bases this season and is in the league table.
Detroit held his ninth inning, Mauer scored two points off, and Bruce Rondon gave a score of 5-4 for the Tigers.
However, this right-handed one-time retiree to three odds.
Detroit took the advantage to score points on Phil Hughes' game.
The Tigers took three orbits in the first two shifts against a retired right-handed man who came into the game after a break for a moment's back muscle inflammation.
"I certainly didn't envision such a start," Hughes said, "but I already felt during my third inning that I felt I was doing better to pitch."
After resisting the onslaught in the first inning, Hughes let one point in the second to the Metal Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for the right-hand laundry J.D. Martinez was carried out by Victor Martinez, who first ran all the bases.
Victor Martinez broke his 0-21 series.
Third-batchers Nick Castellanos followed him with a point to the right side of the field and scored with another ring, but Victor Martinez was overturned when he tried to reach the third base.
The Tigers added in the second inning when pitcher James McCann and fielder Anthony Gose got them two and, by extension, one point and a score of 30.
"That got us in the knees," said the Twin Towers' Manager Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won the pitch, finished in the third inning without scoring points and was replaced by right-his A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran off for three bases, scoring six hits and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the Tigers' right pitcher, ended the fight with pain in his right shoulder.
He will be taken care of by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list thanks to his outstretched muscles in the shoulder since mid-August, is expected to start in Wednesday's game.
Sanchez will be replaced by left-handed Daniel Norris, who will return from injury and take on the Twin Towers.
From 30. June, when Norris was traded for left-handed pitcher David Price, he scores 1-1 after 4 games.
However, he has not yet played since August 20 because of a stretched muscle.
The Tigers and the Twin Towers will play their third match at the Target Field Stadium on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will face Minnesota's left pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for the opening of the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open up the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told the group, whose task is to reform the governance on Tuesday.
"China should be involved in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving open policies," the central group's head of the Deepening of the Over-Chief Reforms said regarding the 16th meeting.
Promoting opening up in the in-reliferation will give new impetus and vitality, and will also provide new room for economic growth, says Xi.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of market regulatory access, the loosening of border control policy, support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and reorganise the residential registration system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up to identify sectors and enterprises that are outside the investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through test programmes.
This step is significant because it will provide a greater role for the market in the allocation of resources, to ensure the business environment and to make the market more open, the statement says.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to firms and make sure that the firms themselves decide how to run their business.
The statement also states that China will allow the border areas to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an effort to open up the state-controlled sector, more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of companies that are financed from abroad and will provide them with better services," the statement reads.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or for a "green card," by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the application process.
Providing the rights of attorneys to practise and develop professional judges and the prosecutor was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Lecturers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
There may be new bed wards in the Karlovy Vary Region.
According to the Deputy Governor of the Karlovy Vary Region, Jakub Pánik (ČSSD), the current capacity of the inpatient wards of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial modifications should be made on the basis of an agreement between departments of individual hospitals.
In the region, however, there are also possibilities of expanding care.
For example, in the surgical department department, there could be a one-day surgical center where surgical procedures would be performed according to the set concept, which do not require more than 24 hours to be hospitalized.
In which specific hospitals should be in the workplaces focused on one-day surgery is not yet clear.
In the skin department of the Karlovy Vary Hospital, a laser center could be created with the possibility of using laser technique for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the creation of an apalic centre to take care of patients with a brain condition who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be established centrally and be an integral part of the anesthesia-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility in the Ostrov hospital, where such care already exists.
Another bed capacity that appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary Region is the aftercare beds, especially the bedbeds of the Long-Aid for the Long-Term Patients (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdek is insufficient and, above all, should be closely connected to acute care beds.
Part of this facility should function as rehabilitation beds and part as a classic LDN bed, the concept recommends.
As he points out, the aftercare beds are mainly absent from the Karlovy Vary Hospital.
There, you could use the abandoned buildings after centralization.
Last but not least, in the Karlovy Vary Region, there are no social health beds with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
These beds are in short supply throughout the country, so it could also serve for other regions as the so-called Alzheimercentrum.
Hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds, for which European subsidies will be mobilised, as recommended.
"These are beds that will follow up on the subjects of super-specialized care and will form a space for translating patients after the procedure, for example, after the procedure, for example, after cardiac surgery, neurosurgical, transplantation or other procedure," the regional concept of inpatient care describes.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
